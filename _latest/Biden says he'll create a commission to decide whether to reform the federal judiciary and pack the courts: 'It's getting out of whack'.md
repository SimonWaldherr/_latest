He was vague about what reforms he's interested in exploring, but said they'd "go well beyond packing."</p><p>"The way in which it's being handled, and it's not about court packing, there's a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I've looked to see what recommendations that commission might make," Biden said.&#160;</p>

<div><p>Halloween 2020 is fast approaching, and just because we're living through a pandemic doesn't mean we can't dress up.</p>
<p>This year, Halloween will undoubtedly look and feel a lot different. But we can still celebrate. We just have to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-celebrate-halloween-safely-pandemic-2020/">take proper safety precautions</a>, such as social distancing and wearing protective face masks in public and around anyone outside of our quarantine bubbles.&#160;</p>
<p>It's been a tough year, so if you're having trouble coming up with a clever Halloween costume, we get it. We've compiled a helpful list of 11 creative quarantine-themed Halloween costumes for your consideration. (Please note: A bottle of Corona beer did not make the cut, because it's likely going to be the holiday's most annoying, played out look.)</p>
<p>Here are 11 Halloween costumes that are sure to make serious statements at your virtual Halloween parties or small, socially distanced outdoor gatherings.</p>
<h2><strong>1. A bottle of hand sanitizer or the cleaning product of your choosing</strong></h2>
<p>'Tis the season to celebrate Halloween while staying safe and killing germs, so why not dress like a bottle of hand sanitizer to remind everyone? Amazon offers a few ridiculous off-brand <a href="https://zdcs.link/M1Bl1" target="_blank">hand sanitizer costumes</a>, as well as some <a href="https://zdcs.link/gM8Be" target="_blank">knockoff Purell shirt options</a>. But if you're looking to save money just print your own Purell label, slap it on a white shirt, and fashion a pump for your head. If you're worried that too many people will dress as hand sanitizer this year (extremely possible!) then go as soap, Lysol wipes, or your personal favorite cleaning supply.</p>
<h2><strong>2. A (face) masked superhero</strong></h2>
<p>Not all heroes wear capes, but in 2020 all heroes definitely wear masks. We know that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html" target="_blank">wearing protective face masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>, so it's crucial that anyone celebrating the holiday with others wears a face mask. As we noted in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-celebrate-halloween-safely-pandemic-2020/">our guide to safely celebrating Halloween</a>, costume masks don't offer proper protection from the coronavirus, so you'll need to wear a protective cloth mask with your costume.</p>
<p>If you don't want your protective mask to take away from your costume aesthetics, consider making the mask part of your costume and go as a masked superhero. All you need is a face mask, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adults-Superhero-Capes-Costume-Supplies/dp/B01MTNBA4X" target="_blank">a cape</a>, and &#160;an eye mask if you really want to sell it. You can also spend the day telling people you're helping save lives by wearing a mask.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Someone half-dressed for a Zoom call</strong></h2>
<p>

</p><p>One of the most effortless quarantine-themed costumes involves dressing the way you probably do every day for a Zoom call &#8212; presentable on top and in pajama bottoms. For this WFH costume all you need is to do your hair, makeup, and wear a stylish shirt, then pair that with some extremely casual bottoms, socks, and/or slippers.

<h2><strong>4. Dr. Fauci</strong></h2>
<p>

</p><p>During the early months of quarantine when everyone was glued to their television screens waiting to hear the latest coronavirus updates, we got to know Dr. Anthony Fauci pretty well. The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is a trusted source of information and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dr-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-pandemic-crush/">a soothing presence in an otherwise chaotic year</a>.</p>
<p>This Halloween, you can honor Dr. Fauci by not only wearing a protective face mask and practicing social distancing, but by wearing a Fauci costume. All you need is <a href="https://zdcs.link/VOpZx" target="_blank">a gray wig</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/q2633" target="_blank">glasses</a>, a face mask, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/EAOmX" target="_blank">a white lab coat</a>. If <a href="https://me.mashable.com/entertainment/10061/brad-pitt-as-dr-fauci-on-snl-reminds-viewers-not-to-inject-bleach">Brad Pitt could pull it off</a> so can you.</p>
<p>You can also wear a suit and tie you already own and jazz it up with <a href="https://zdcs.link/EAOmX" target="_blank">a Dr. Fauci name tag</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jjmnp" target="_blank">photo ID badge</a> from Etsy. And there's a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/835667854/dr-fauci-costume-doctor-anthony-fauci" target="_blank">printable Fauci costume mask</a> if you want to take things to the next level. As for your protective face mask, any one will do. There's also a variety of <a href="https://zdcs.link/PRqdy" target="_blank">protective Fauci-themed face masks</a>, but if you want to properly emulate you should probably sport <a href="https://zdcs.link/1P4Kb" target="_blank">a Washington Nationals mask</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>5. A character from a popular quarantine show</strong></h2>
<p>Quarantine can feel super isolating, but a lot of shared experiences &#8212; such as devouring the same TV shows &#8212; continue to bring people to together online. If you're searching for a timely 2020 costume, dress as a character from a popular TV show that was released (or rewatched) during quarantine. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/netflix-tiger-king-review/">Tiger King</a>, <a href="https://me.mashable.com/entertainment/10084/normal-people-is-true-to-the-book-and-heart-wrenchingly-romantic">Normal People</a>, <a href="https://me.mashable.com/entertainment/10078/mindy-kalings-never-have-i-ever-is-irresistible-important-and-funny-as-hell">Never Have I Ever</a>, <a href="https://me.mashable.com/entertainment/11714/emily-in-paris-doesnt-understand-the-first-thing-about-social-media-we-love-it-anyway">Emily in Paris</a>, or an old favorite comfort binge like <a href="https://me.mashable.com/entertainment/11575/shoutout-to-new-girl-the-ultimate-quarantine-comfort-watch">New Girl</a> are all solid options.

<strong>6. An ode to </strong><strong>Animal Crossing</strong>

</p><p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons was the game of quarantine. It brought everyone together and gave us a delightful form of escapism, so it's only right that we show our gratitude this Halloween by dressing as some of our favorite island residents.&#160;</p>
<p>As Refinery29 <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10070138/animal-crossing-costumes-halloween-2020" target="_blank">noted</a>, Amazon features a bunch of adorable Animal Crossing cosplay apparel and accessories like <a href="https://zdcs.link/yogZP" target="_blank">this Tom Nook shirt</a> and an <a href="https://zdcs.link/nnGbD" target="_blank">Isabelle outfit</a>. Check to see if your favorite New Horizons character has any costume options, and if not it's time for some DIY crafting.</p>
<h2><strong>7. A couch potato</strong></h2>
<p>Who among us hasn't turned into a couch potato during quarantine? Halloween is the perfect opportunity to declare your love for your couch. And while <a href="https://zdcs.link/KxN2B" target="_blank">couch potato costumes do exist</a>, you can also <a href="https://zdcs.link/3Poj2" target="_blank">dress as a regular potato</a> and call into a virtual costume party from your couch. A lot of possibilities here.</p>
<h2><strong>8. A game of telephone</strong></h2>
<p>

</p><p>Looking for the perfect quarantine couple costume? How about two people playing a nice safe game of telephone? Just grab two cans, measure out a six-foot-long string and teach everyone about the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html" target="_blank">importance of social distancing</a>. If you want to get really crafty you can dress as the cans, but who has the energy to make can costumes right now?</p>
<h2><strong>9. Someone who's late to the quarantine dyed hair trend</strong></h2>
<p>Quarantine gave us the perfect opportunity to experiment with our hair. Some people tried (and failed) to replicate their salon cuts, others let their locks grow way too long, and many brave souls decided to dye their hair a fun color. If you were one of the scaredy cats (like me) who couldn't bring yourself to take part in the quarantine hair dye trend, then you should live out what could have been with the help of <a href="https://zdcs.link/jVLe2" target="_blank">a colorful costume wig.</a> This Halloween, go as someone who's late to the quarantine hair dye trend. You can fake being edgy while still maintaining your normal hairstyle. And who knows, maybe you'll love the look so much you'll finally commit to the real deal.</p>
<h2><strong>10. A viral quarantine food or drink</strong></h2>
<p>

</p><p>Quirky hairstyles aren't the only viral trend that quarantine has inspired. People also spent a great deal of their extra at-home time in the kitchen baking bread, mixing cocktails, and trying their hand at internet-famous recipes.</p>
<p>If you're looking to dress as a popular quarantine food or drink, consider some sourdough or banana bread, Dalgona coffee, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-grow-scallions-in-water/">a bunch of scallions</a>, a can of beans, a bowl of pancake cereal, or a celebrity cocktail like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ina-garten-cosmo-recipe-quarantine/">Ina Garten's crisis cocktail</a> or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/stanley-tucci-negroni-cocktail/">Stanley Tucci's Negroni</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>11. A quaranteen</strong></h2>
<p>If you're a fan of being simultaneously literal and punny, why not dress as a quarantine (spelled like quaran-teen). If you're already a teenager, congrats &#8212;&#160;you barely have to make an effort here. But if you're an Old, then it's time to get creative. Channel your inner teen by snagging some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-gift-ideas/">popular TikTok accessories</a>, grabbing <a href="https://zdcs.link/GbRDE" target="_blank">your Hydro Flask</a>, and throwing on <a href="https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=647536042&amp;pcid=999&amp;vid=1&amp;&amp;searchText=tie%20dye#pdp-page-content" target="_blank">some tie-dye apparel</a>. Oh, and don't forget to wear a protective face mask to stress the whole "we're living through a pandemic and quarantining" part.</p>
<p>Have a safe, socially distanced Halloween, everyone! Here's hoping things will be less weird next year.</p>

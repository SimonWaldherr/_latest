<div><p>A Labour frontbencher has been told she must repay more than &#163;1,100 after an inquiry found she breached Commons rules by using Parliamentary stationery to send a &#8220;Brexit Update&#8221; letter to her constituents.</p>
<p>The Commons Standards Committee found that Rosena Allin-Khan, a Shadow Health Minister, breached the rules by sending 1,624 letters in pre-paid envelopes before last year&#8217;s general election.</p>
<p>Under the Commons rules, MPs can only use House stationery for their work as a Member of Parliament and are banned from using it to campaign.</p>
<p>Kathryn Stone, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, said Dr Allin-Khan's mailshot used "public resources to highlight to a group of voters her position and record on an issue that was one of the key themes of the imminent election".</p>
<p>In her report to the committee, Ms Stone noted that it was the third time in three years that Dr Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting, had breached the rules.</p>
<p>They included a previous occasion when she sent out party-political literature on stationery with the royal badge of the crowned portcullis.</p>
<p>The committee recommended she should repay the &#163;1,142.52 cost of the delivery and should make a personal statement in the House apologising for the breach.</p>
<p>It said she should also agree steps to prevent further breaches and that her progress should be reviewed after three and six months, and recommended a more &#8220;serious sanction&#8221; if she breaks the rules again.</p>
<p>Dr Allin-Khan did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

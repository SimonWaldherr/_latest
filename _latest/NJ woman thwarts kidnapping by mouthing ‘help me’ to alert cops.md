<div><p>A woman foiled a kidnappers&#8217; plot to shake them down by mouthing &#8220;help me&#8221; to a stranger in a New Jersey parking lot, police said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The dramatic encounter unfolded Friday evening while a couple was sitting in their parked car near the Main and Vreeland avenues in Clifton and a stranger, who identified himself as a cop, knocked on the driver&#8217;s side window, according to local police.</p>
<p>The phony lawman, 39-year-old Travis Mann told the two they were &#8220;&#8216;breaking the law&#8217; by being intimate in a public place&#8221; and had to pony up some cash to avoid arrest, Clifton Lt. Robert Bracken said.</p>
<p>Mann told the two he was armed and order them to drive to an ATM to withdraw money as the kidnappers alleged accomplice, 45-year-old Paul Dunlop, followed behind, police said.</p>
<p>After the man withdrew cash &#8212; the woman mouthed the words &#8220;help me&#8221; to someone who had just pulled into the bank parking lot and they called the cops.</p>
<p>Offices rushed to the scene and rescue the couple, Bracken said.</p>
<p>Cops charged Mann and Dunlop with kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery, according to Bracken</p>
<p>Mann was also slapped with counts of impersonating a police officer and criminal coercion.</p>
<p>Mann was busted back in May by Paterson police for <a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases20/pr20200508c.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">failing to register as a sex offender</a> after causing a scene in a &#160;7-Eleven&#160; and flouting social distancing guidelines, police said.</p>
<p>The sex offender had been previously convicted of drug possession, carjacking and robbery, court records show.</p>

This Ukrainian Instagram model was not being tongue in cheek when she said she wants even larger features.

Anastasia Pokreshchuk, 30, claims to have the “biggest cheeks in the world” — but wants to pump them up with fillers even further, the Daily Star reported.

“You may think that they are too big but I think that they’re a little bit small, I need to refresh them again soon,” the Kiev resident said.

Pokreshchuk received her first cheek injections four years ago and has not looked back.

“After I had the injections and saw the changes in my cheeks, I fell in love with them,” she said.

“I love them, I want them to look like this and I’m very happy. I regularly inject other parts of my face myself,” she added. “I understand that they look weird for other people but I don’t mind.”

Pokreshchuk — who has amassed more than 220,000 Instagram followers — also has had extensive work done on her oversized lips and forehead.

When she is trolled online with cruel comments about her looks, she turns the other cheek.

“I’ve had people tell me I am an ugly b—- and that I should kill myself but when I see it I just laugh it off and ignore it,” she said, the Mirror reported.

To complete her transformation, Pokreshchuk said she also wants to go under the knife.

“I want to get a boob job because nature didn’t give me any breasts at all,” she said.

Callous Tory ministers are refusing to improve wage support for local lockdowns as northern anger brims over.

A leading Conservative today begged ministers to raise the 67% wage subsidy to 80% for staff in the north of England whose pubs and restaurants are about to be shut down.

The Tory leader of Bolton Council united with Greater Manchester's Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, and other northern leaders to urge the wage package to be improved.

David Greenhalgh said without more wage support he would oppose the new 'three-tier' local lockdown system - and have to be forced into it by a Commons vote.

He said being left on two-thirds wages will be "unacceptable" for hospitality staff, pleading: "Please listen again - the north feels they are being treated differently."

Yet Tory Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick batted aside calls to raise the cash saying: "We can’t do everything."

And quizzed on whether energy companies should help people stuck on two-thirds wages who can't pay their bills, he said: "That’s a matter for the energy companies."

Claiming there was a "good safety net", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: "They need to be seen in the context of everything else we’ve done.

"This country has put in place measures which compare extremely favourably to other countries.

"We can’t do everything, there is a limit to what the state can do here. But we are trying to support these communities."

But Greater Manchester metro mayor Andy Burnham fumed: "Given we’re talking about people on the minimum wage or just above, working in just one industry, and it only applying in a limited number of places, the idea we can’t afford it is frankly ridiculous."

The Prime Minister will speak to Cabinet ministers today and make a statement to Parliament on Monday afternoon announcing fresh curbs to combat Covid.

Boris Johnson is expected to unveil a three-tier system with graded restrictions depending on local infection rates.

Moves in Tier 3 areas could include shutting pubs and restaurants, telling millions not to travel outside their areas, and banning households mixing - even outdoors.

Tier 2 areas would reflect current local lockdown conditions while Tier 1 would reflect rules for the rest of England, including the rule of six and 10pm pub curfew.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced any firms forced to close by the government, be they locally or nationally, can have two-thirds of workers' wages paid by the state.

But the pledge won't apply to up to a million workers in sectors that can barely operate but haven't legally been shut - such as wedding planners and entertainers.

Anyone whose venue is not completely shut down must rely on the less generous Job Support Scheme, which needs staff to work at least a third of their hours and only gives 22% government support.

The PM could face a Commons showdown if mounting anger among northern Tory MPs spills over.

Manchester MPs wrote to the PM and Chancellor today saying they do not believe the area should be Tier 3 because infections are concentrated among students.

Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said Labour would be seeking a way to challenge the plans in a Commons vote - thought didn't say if Labour would actually vote them down.

“I haven’t felt anger like this towards the government since I was growing up in the 1980s," she told the BBC.

“People don’t just feel abandoned, but as if the government is actively working against us."

Mr Jenrick told Times Radio: “Nobody’s punishing the north”.

Yet several Tory ministers' own constituencies now have infection rates far higher than northern cities' were when they were locked down.

Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said if the same thing happened in London or the South East “it simply wouldn’t be tolerated”.

"If this was in London we wouldn't be talking about this. It's because it's the North West they want to do it on the cheap and we're not going to allow them to do that," he told Times Radio.

"Let me make this absolutely clear, the people in the North West won't stay on their knees and tolerate the government that is actually dictating in a way that is going to damage our economy for many, many years to come."

Mr Anderson said he expects Liverpool to be put in Tier 3.

Demanding ministers “wake up and smell the coffee”, he said the impact on unemployment would be similar to that seen in the city in the 1980s.

Greater Manchester metro mayor Andy Burnham said on Sunday morning he was “still in discussions” about what lockdown measures would be applied to his area.

He demanded ministers improve the two-thirds wage support for shut-down businesses to the 80% of wages paid by the state in March.

“if there is to be any form of lockdown, it has to come with the same support that was provided earlier this year,” he told Times Radio.

Yet Mr Burnham said officials had already made clear on Friday that “they weren’t prepared to have any further negotiation on the financial package.”

He added: “This is people’s lives, this is people’s business, this is the future of our region. If you expect us to go quiet and accept our fate.. we’re not going to do that."

Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, Greater Manchester, warned: “There is resentment, to be frank.

"There is resentment about the North/South divide in some of these local restrictions and you can see that coming across. So unless the Prime Minister gets a grip of this, it will get even more difficult."

But Mr Reynolds suggested Labour would back the 10pm curfew on pubs, despite Keir Starmer demanding evidence for it last week.

Asked if Labour would back the curfew he replied: "Yes, we back restrictions in hospitality as long as they’ve got the economic support that should go with that."

Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam today warned: "In our national fight against Covid-19, we are at a tipping point similar to where we were in March."

He added: "We can prevent history repeating itself if we all act now."

But Professor Peter Horby, who chairs the Government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threat Advisory Group, feared a second national lockdown could be needed.

Northern leaders said they backed the need for restrictions but more most be done to help the hardest-hit.

It comes as ministers plan to give town halls more powers over the test and trace system to try to secure their support.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told Sky News: “We are going to be ensuring that the national testing infrastructure works in harmony with what's happening locally because local councils and local communities are very good at contact tracing, understandably, because they know their communities.”

Separately, the company is introducing a prompt encouraging users to read a news article that has been shared, before they retweet it. It says an early test found that significantly more people read the article when this prompt existed, but also that many people went on not to share the piece.

The last of these findings is the most telling, because it is a violation of the Silicon Valley gospel of reducing friction: the change reduced use of Twitter’s service by deliberately making a process more complicated and slower. It is likely that other measures, such as asking users to comment before retweeting, will do the same thing.

The new measures announced by Twitter were largely applauded, and the company’s shares were largely unaffected by it on Friday, so there seems to be little downside. So naturally, the question arises of why the company did not do it sooner. The problems caused by the retweet button are not new ones, after all. It is possible that it has taken today’s unprecedented situation – a pandemic that has fuelled conspiracy theories and a US election that promises to be the nastiest for decades – to force action.

The previous social media bogeyman – interference operations from overseas troll farms – has largely been kept quiet, forcing tech companies to look inward at the behaviour they have incentivised. Even Facebook, which has been far more reluctant than Twitter to embrace friction, has done so to an extent, limiting the spread of political advertising immediately before and after the election.

There is some way to go on this front. Facebook has continued to push the use of private groups into users’ feeds, pushing to create online communities despite signs that they have become breeding grounds for conspiracy theorists.

Nonetheless, tech companies are having to embrace an uncomfortable truth. Facebook and Twitter limiting how users can congregate and broadcast involves accepting that their services’ default state of speedy and effortless sharing is not a desirable thing. But gradually, they are inching towards that realisation. One of Silicon Valley’s bedrock principles is now being questioned. It has taken long enough.

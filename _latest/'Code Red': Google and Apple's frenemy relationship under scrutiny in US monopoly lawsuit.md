<div><p>Inside Google, it is called the &#8220;Code Red&#8221; scenario. Losing the company&#8217;s hallowed position as the iPhone&#8217;s de facto search engine would be a nightmare moment, cutting off both advertising revenue and query data, not to mention leaving the door open for competitors.</p>
<p>No wonder that the internet giant pays through the nose for the privilege. According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/20/us-charge-google-violating-federal-competition-law/">US government charges against Google filed on Tuesday</a>, the company pays Apple up to $12bn (&#163;9.2bn)&#160;a year to be the default search engine, a cosy state of affairs which is claimed freezes out competitors and maintains the company&#8217;s search monopoly.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has put the relationship between two tech behemoths, once seen as rivals, under the spotlight. Undoing it might have dramatic consequences for both. Google&#8217;s search has long been a punching bag for antitrust regulators, but Apple's supporting role received much of the focus in Tuesday&#8217;s lawsuit.</p>
<p>The US charges focus on <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/20/us-government-googles-search-engine-monopoly/">the company's payments to a wide range of phone manufacturers, telecoms companies and web browsers</a> to keep Google's search engine in front of consumers. These &#8220;exclusivity deals&#8221;, which cost the company billions of dollars every year, secure Google&#8217;s presence on phones, laptops and web browsers and in some cases specifically prohibit those it is paying from doing business with Google&#8217;s rivals.</p>
<p>By far the biggest exclusivity deal is with Apple, a company that has long been seen as a rival and has purposefully avoided getting its hands dirty in the world of internet advertising.</p>
<p>Google pays an estimated $8bn to $12bn a year to Apple to make its search engine the default on the iPhone&#8217;s Safari browser, the Siri voice assistant and Spotlight, the search feature embedded in iOS.</p>
<p>Translated another way, Google&#8217;s payments to Apple account for up to a fifth of the iPhone maker&#8217;s entire annual profits.&#160;Apple did not respond to a request for comment on these figures or the wider lawsuit against Google.</p>

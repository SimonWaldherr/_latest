She is one of music's fastest rising stars.

And Doja Cat, who recently released two singles and put on a show-stopping performance at the Billboard Music Awards, is gracing three different covers of Cosmopolitan magazine.

The 24-year-old hitmaker revealed on Friday that she will be the cover star for the magazines Hrvatska (Croatia), Middle East and Spain.

Cover girl: Doja Cat, who recently released two singles and put on a show-stopping performance at the Billboard Music Awards, is gracing three different covers of Cosmopolitan magazine (Croatia, Spain and Middle East)

For the Cosmopolitan Middle East cover, Doja (born Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini) wore a sky blue wrap dress.

The Juicy singer's hair was down behind her back in a bright pink style, matching the writing on the cover.

She teamed her look with large star-point, earrings with two tiers, the smaller being closer to her ear and the larger resting on her shoulder.

Doja looked absolutely glamorous with her eyes in a golden shade, with large fluffy lashes, and a nude lined glossy pout.

Show stopping: For the covers she wore her hair in a bright pink color, and donned different form fitting outfits as she shared the covers to Instagram on Friday

While for her Croatia cover, the rapper tied her still bright pink hair up into a low bun, with long strands pointing off of her head.

With strands falling in front of her face, she posed with one hand on her hip and the other angled back.

Her outfit took center stage as she wore a bright and colorful bodycon dress in a multi-floral print.

With the magazine she discussed her rise to fame and hate she has received and how she has learned from it.

Winner: 'I didn’t know how appreciative I would be for that award until I got it,' she said of winning Best New Artist at the VMAs recently (pictured at the 2020 VMAs in August)

'I didn’t know how appreciative I would be for that award until I got it,' she said of winning Best New Artist at the VMAs recently.

Adding: 'It just reminded me that I love making music, and this is why I’m here. I just want to make videos and do fun stuff.'

She initially rose to fame in 2018 after her parody song Moo went viral. Though more recently has topped charts with her hit Say So, that saw Nicki Minaj on the remix, Juicy and Tia Tamera off her sophomore album Hot Pink.

Most recently she just dropped her latest single Gimme More with Sia and Ozuna, she was also featured on Bebe Rexha's latest single Baby, I'm Jealous.

No beef: As she continues to rise to fame, she doesn't want to fall into the conversation of being pitted against other female rappers or R&B singers saying: 'I appreciate it a lot when I’m compared to Nicki, I think it’s cool. I look up to a lot of people who came before me. But there’s no competition, the music industry just needs more female artists' (pictured October 2020)

Though, Doja has often found herself on the wrong end if the online 'cancel culture' conversation.

'There’s a good side to it, because I’ve had to correct myself a lot. I’ve had to grow up because of it,' she said. 'And I think it’s helped me revaluate stuff and become a better person.'

Adding: 'When you get picked at a lot, and critiqued constantly because you’re under a microscope, it’s allowed me to trim off parts of myself that maybe weren’t useful to me.'

As she continues to rise to fame, she doesn't want to fall into the conversation of being pitted against other female rappers or R&B singers.

Focus: 'My next album is done, so we’re kind of just sifting through everything and figuring out what works best together,' the California native said. 'But other than that, I’m working on some performances too and that’s pretty much it' (pictured during her Billboard Music Awards performance on October 14)

'There are less than 600 of us [female rappers], so comparisons are always going to happen, it’s completely natural and I accept it,' she said.

Adding: 'I appreciate it a lot when I’m compared to Nicki, I think it’s cool. I look up to a lot of people who came before me. But there’s no competition, the music industry just needs more female artists.'

She also said her next album is already done and she is preparing to drop it.

'My next album is done, so we’re kind of just sifting through everything and figuring out what works best together,' the California native said. 'But other than that, I’m working on some performances too and that’s pretty much it.'

At the Trump rally in Georgia, the president falsely claims the pandemic is ending without the vaccine. He promises to have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year, but says the country doesn’t need it anyway. The statement ignores the fact that case numbers are again increasing significantly in the United States, particularly in Midwest states like Wisconsin, which has just recorded record cases, hospitalisations, and deaths.

Trump: “Without the vaccine it’s ending too. We’re rounding the turn. It’s ending without the vaccine, but the vaccine is going to make it quicker.”

<p>"I was very fortunate as my diagnosis came with minimal symptoms, though they hit me all at once and it seemed to be a roller coaster of symptoms in the days after," Trump wrote. "I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time. I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food."</p><p>She added: "It was an unfamiliar feeling for me to be the patient instead of a person trying to encourage our nation to stay healthy and safe. It was me being taken care of now, and getting first-hand experience with all that COVID-19 can do."</p><p>While the first lady was able to recover in the White House after her diagnosis, the president's condition was more serious, requiring hospitalization at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.</p><p>In the essay, the first lady also announced that their son Barron had contracted the coronavirus, but was asymptomatic.</p>

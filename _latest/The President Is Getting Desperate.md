<div><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>President Donald Trump is picking fights with cable networks, pressuring his Justice Department to carry out political prosecutions, and showing all-around desperation as national polls show him badly trailing former Vice President Joe Biden.&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>With less than two weeks until Election Day, Trump is trailing in nearly every swing state, and Biden has put states previously thought to be out of reach&#8212;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/12/2020-election-biden-win-arizona-texas-and-georgia/5902421002/">such as Texas and Georgia</a>&#8212;into play. Biden is up 8.5 points nationally, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html">according to aggregator RealClearPolitics</a>.</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>That&#8217;s bringing out an even more vicious Trump than usual. After he <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vjmz/trump-cant-stop-taking-shots-at-fauci-hes-got-a-really-bad-arm">slammed top public health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci this week</a> after Fauci&#8217;s interview with &#8216;60 Minutes,&#8217; Trump ignited a controversy of his own based around the TV show by threatening to release video of the interview before the show airs on Sunday.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;I am pleased to inform you that, for the sake of accuracy in reporting, I am considering posting my interview with Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, PRIOR TO AIRTIME!&#8221; Trump tweeted Tuesday. &#8220;This will be done so that everybody can get a glimpse of what a FAKE and BIASED interview is all about&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Trump&#8217;s threat came amid reports that he walked out of the interview, which took place Monday at the White House. After a 45-minute solo interview with Stahl, Trump walked out in a fit of frustration and didn&#8217;t return for a planned joint interview with Vice President Mike Pence, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/20/politics/trump-interview-60-minutes/index.html">according to CNN</a>.&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Trump also tweeted out a clip of a maskless Stahl in the White House, adding that there was &#8220;much more to come.&#8221; The video of Stahl was taken immediately following the interview and before she was able to put her mask back on, according to CNN.&#160;</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Trump also stepped up his attacks on Hunter Biden on Tuesday, publicly calling on Attorney General William Barr to &#8220;appoint somebody&#8221; to prosecute the former vice president&#8217;s son following <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/business/media/new-york-post-hunter-biden.html">the much-criticized New York Post report</a> suggesting Biden was complicit in corruption in Ukraine. &#8220;We have got to get the attorney general to act. He&#8217;s got to act and he&#8217;s got to act fast," Trump said in an appearance on &#8216;Fox &amp; Friends&#8217;.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;This is major corruption and this has to be known about before the election,&#8221; Trump said.</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Trump has been hitting the campaign trail particularly hard in states he won in 2016. On Monday, before heading to a rally in Arizona&#8212;a state the Democrats have carried in just two presidential elections since the end of World War II&#8212;he <a href="https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/1318311066401648643?s=20">told reporters</a> that he wasn&#8217;t &#8220;running scared&#8221; but rather &#8220;running angry,&#8221; and accused the media of failing to adequately cover the Hunter Biden story to his liking.&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>On Tuesday, he began a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, with a frank admission that he&#8217;s playing defense in a state where his thin margin of victory was key to his 2016 win.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;Before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn&#8217;t coming to Erie,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;I mean, I have to be honest, there was no way I was coming. We had this thing won.&#8221;</p>

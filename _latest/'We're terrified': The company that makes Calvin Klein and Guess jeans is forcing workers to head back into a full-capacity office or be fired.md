G-III employs more than 6,000 employees in the US, according to its 2019 10-K filing.</p><p>All associates in the company's Manhattan headquarters were officially called back to work on September 8 after plans to return on August 3 were pushed back a month. G-III's New York headquarters houses the company's sales, design, merchandising-marketing, and legal teams, as well as the company's C-suite.</p><p>According to email communications from G-III's human-resources team, which were viewed by Business Insider, the company is now requiring all workers to be in the office three days a week and strongly encouraging all workers to be in the office five days a week.</p><p>According to some G-III employees, commuting into their Manhattan office feels both pointless and terrifying. At least five people who visited or worked for G-III's New York office have tested positive for COVID-19 since June, one as recently as October 15, according to email communications from G-III's HR team.</p><p>Business Insider spoke with six G-III employees in New York about their experience returning to the offices. These employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from their company. Business Insider verified their identities.</p><p>G-III did not return Business Insider's request for comment on this story.</p><h2>Retaliation for not coming into the office</h2><p>While it's opening its offices at full capacity, G-III has said in emails to staff that it is following federal, state, and local guidelines for health and safety. In addition to spreading out workspaces, the company requires all employees to wear masks, receive daily temperature checks, and enter and exit the building in a staggered process, according to guidelines sent from G-III HR department.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>For employees coming in at least three days a week, the company is also providing a $100 weekly stipend for commuting costs, presumably to help pay for parking or ride-hailing services.</p><p>According to communication from the company's HR department, failure to cooperate with the minimum in-office workdays can result in consequences from the company.</p><p>In a document outlining G-III's return-to-office procedures, the company said three consecutive days of "unexcused absences" from the office would be the equivalent of an employee's "voluntary resignation." To monitor which employees are entering the office, G-III is tracking swipes on workers' ID cards, the company said in a separate email to its workers.&#160;</p><p>Additionally, any employee making over $100,000 a year before the pandemic will operate at a reduced salary rate unless they come into the office five days a week. On March 24, G-III implemented salary cuts to employees making more than $100,000 a year.</p><p>At the time, G-III CEO Morris Goldfarb and President Sammy Aaron forewent their salaries. Last year, Goldfarb's salary of $1 million was 6% of his reported $16.5 million total compensation, <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/155837020005686/1?cik=821002">according to the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings</a>, while Aaron's $750,000 salary was 6% of his $10.8 million reported total compensation.</p><p>

</p><h2>'We're terrified'</h2><p>According to some employees, G-III's inflexibility about returning to the office is frustrating, especially to those who can continue to fully do their jobs from home.</p><p>"I don't really understand why [we're] sitting at our desks," one G-III employee who has worked with the company for almost two years said. "Is it just so we can look at each other?"</p><p>Beyond frustration, fear of contracting COVID-19 in the office is also on some employees' minds.</p>

<p>Five people who visited or worked in G-III's New York office have tested positive for COVID-19 since June, according to individual email alerts from the company's HR department that notified employees. The latest alert, which was sent to employees on October 18, said a G-III employee who had last been in the office on October 15 tested positive.</p><p>"Despite all precautionary measures, there is always a risk of workplace exposure to COVID-19," the company said in an email to staff.</p><p>"We're terrified," the aforementioned G-III employee said. "This is not something I take lightly."</p><p>The beauty company L'Or&#233;al USA is also in the process of calling its employees back to work, a move that initially caused a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/loreal-opens-offices-to-50-capacity-covid-19-cases-rise-2020-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backlash</a> from employees in May. L'Or&#233;al's decision to return the offices, which are operating at 50% capacity, stems from a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/loreal-us-ceo-reveals-why-company-forcing-workers-back-office-2020-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company philosophy</a> that values in-person collaboration and on-site face time, a leaked memo said.</p><p>According to some employees at G-III, there has been little communication from their company as to the reason for returning.</p><p>"L'Or&#233;al was very specific, with their C-suite talking about why '<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/loreal-us-ceo-reveals-why-company-forcing-workers-back-office-2020-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beauty is not virtual</a>,' etc. We never got any of that. We were actually just told to buckle up and figure it out," another G-III employee who has been with the company for about a year said. "There's just no clear communication with this company."</p><p>G-III said in a Q&amp;A document that it would not make any accommodations for employees above the age of 65 to work from home based on their age. According to some employees, having people come into the office is hurting morale at the company.</p><p>"We're all fed up," one employee said. "It's just a very toxic work environment."</p>

“Two and a Half Men” star Conchata Ferrell died Monday after complications following a cardiac arrest. She was 77.

While rumors swirled online that Ferrell had died on August 8 from a heart attack, the “L.A. Law” actress passed away surrounded by family October 12 at Sherman Oaks Hospital in Sherman Oaks, California, Deadline reported.

Ferrell, who was nominated for three Emmy Awards during her career, was best known for playing housekeeper Berta on the CBS show “Two and a Half Men” alongside Jon Cryer, Charlie Sheen and more.

“She was a beautiful human,” Cryer, 55, said in a statement on Twitter. “Berta’s gruff exterior was an invention of the writers. Chatty’s warmth and vulnerability were her real strengths. I’m crying for the woman I’ll miss, and the joy she brought so many.”

His statement continued on through several tweets, one in which he recalled meeting the legendary actress.

“I remember her first day on ‘2 1/2 Men.’ It was our second episode and I felt so lucky that they’d been able to cast her on the show. I gushed to her about what a fan i was of hers and she simply refused to believe it,” he wrote. “I had to recount one of my favorite bits of hers from a cancelled mid ’70s sitcom called ‘Hot L Baltimore’ before she finally got that I was serious.”

Cryer added: “I’m glad that I absolutely knew how fortunate I was to share a stage with her. I treasured every moment and will continue to until we meet again. I have a feeling she’ll call me ‘Zippy.'”

Their controversial co-star also paid warm tribute to Ferrell’s enduring talents.

“An absolute sweetheart, a consummate pro, a genuine friend a shocking and painful loss,” Sheen, 55, wrote on Twitter. “Berta, your housekeeping was a tad suspect, your ‘people’ keeping was perfect.”

As word of her passing spread across social media, emotional tributes started pouring in Tuesday night.

“RIP Conchata Ferrell,” “Two and a Half Men” co-creator Lee Aronsohn wrote on Twitter. “A warm, wonderful woman who was always a joy to be around on set. My heart goes out to her husband Arnie, who was *always* by her side. Bye, Chatty.”

“Dammit. Dammit. #ConchataFerrell was a lovely woman. I did #TwoAndAHalfMen at the very start of my career,” added “Community” actress Yvette Nicole Brown. “I learned a lot from her. I hate the callousness of 2020. I really, really do.”

Ferrell, who began her career on the stage in off-Broadway productions, also starred in Netflix’s “The Ranch,” and her film credits include “Network,” “Heartland,” “Mystic Pizza,” “True Romance,” “Erin Brockovich,” “Edward Scissorhands” and “Krampus.” She was slated to appear in the upcoming feature “Deported,” according to Deadline.

In July, Ferrell was moved into a long-term care facility after more than a month in the intensive care unit, TMZ reported at the time, following a cardiac arrest.

She is survived by her husband, Arnie Anderson, and her daughter, Samantha.

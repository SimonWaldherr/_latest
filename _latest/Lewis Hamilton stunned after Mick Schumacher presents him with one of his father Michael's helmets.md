Not many have been managed to catch Lewis Hamilton by surprise in the last few years of Formula One.

But Mick Schumacher certainly caught the world champion off guard following the Eifel Grand Prix, which Hamilton largely dominated to take his 91st Formula One victory.

In doing so, the Brit matched the record set by Michael Schumacher and he was greeted by the German legend's son in parc ferme as he was being interviewed after the race.

The gift came as a result of Hamilton equalling Michael Schumacher's record of 91 GP wins

Mick, who is leading the F2 championship and could feature in F1 next season, presented Hamilton with one of his father's crash helmets during his time with Mercedes in 2012.

Hamilton replaced Schumacher at the team in 2013 and after shaking hands with Mick spoke on how he never dreamed of matching Michael's record while he was growing up watching the former Ferrari star dominate the sport.

'I don't even know what to say,' he said after the race. 'When you grow up watching someone and you genuinely idolise them, in terms of the quality of the driver they are.

The crash helmet was one from Michael's final season in the sport from 2012

Schumacher ended his career at Mercedes in 2012, and was replaced by Hamilton in 2013

'Seeing his dominance for so long I didn't think I'd be anywhere near Michael in terms of records so it's an incredible honour. It's going to take time to get used to it.

'It was only when I got into the pit-lane I realised I had equalled it. A big thank you and huge respect to Michael. I feel humbled by the moment. Hopefully we have more records to break.'

Hamilton reflected on how he would race as Schumacher on racing games along with his brother while growing up, and that matching his record was unbelievable following his win at the Nurburgring.

'I remember sitting with my brother and dad watching races every Sunday, watching Michael storm ahead,' he told Sky Sports.

'We would watch the first half and then at the end me and my brother would race a computer game upstairs and I would be Michael.

'I was always Michael he was phenomenal. That was when I was 13 or 14. I did one day dream of being here but this is beyond my wildest dreams of reaching Michael's wins. It's very hard to describe how I feel my mind is blown. I have a bit of a headache!

Michael Schumacher has been recovering from a horrific skiing accident since 2013 which saw him suffer from head injuries and placed into a medically induced coma.

His health is now shrouded in mystery but recent reports have claimed he has been moved to a Â£27m mansion in Majorca.

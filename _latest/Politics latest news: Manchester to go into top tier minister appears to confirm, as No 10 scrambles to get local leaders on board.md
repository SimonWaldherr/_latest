A minister has suggested it is a foregone conclusion that Greater Manchester will have the most severe measures imposed today, despite local leaders threatening legal action over such a move.

Nadhim Zahawi, the business minister, made the admission as he apologised after several local representatives including the Conservative MP for Hazel Grove - William Wragg - said they had been missed off a list of attendees to a Zoom call with health minister Helen Whately this morning.

He told Sky News: "I hope that they can be at the meeting and make time for that meeting so they can hear from the chief medical officer, from the deputy chief medical officer, as to why we're having to take this action."

But asked if saying "we're having to take this action" meant the move had already been decided, the minister said: "What I'm saying to you is they need to see the data and of course that decision will be made jointly with local leaders."

Yesterday Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said any change to the tier levels would be "by imposition, not consent", saying he would consider legal action to protect the livelihoods of local people.

London MPs are also expected to be told this morning that the capital will be placed into tier two - meaning an imminent ban on indoor household mixing - although one said there had been "problems with the invite", leaving several representatives in the dark.

Matt Hancock is due to give a statement to the House of Commons this morning at 11:30am.

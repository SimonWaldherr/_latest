  The Metropolitan Police has dropped a “race hate” investigation into Darren Grimes and Dr David Starkey because it was not “proportionate”.Scotland Yard was forced to backtrack after a free speech backlash which included criticism from the current and former Home Secretaries and the former Director of Public Prosecution.The police u-turn has been described as “a “sweet victory” for free speech and for the “cause of liberty”.By Monday, after a weekend of backlash over the impact the investigation could have on free speech, the Metropolitan Police had appointed a senior officer to review the investigation.Mr Grimes and Dr Starkey were informed days later that the case was on hold and they would not be required to attend an interview.

<div><p>The Metropolitan Police has dropped a &#8220;race hate&#8221; investigation into Darren Grimes and Dr David Starkey because it was not &#8220;proportionate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard was forced to backtrack after a free speech backlash which included criticism from the current and former Home Secretaries and the former Director of Public Prosecution.</p>
<p>Mr Grimes said that he was &#8220;delighted&#8221; but questioned how the investigation had got to the point where he was due to be interviewed under caution and called for the release of the legal advice&#160;which &#8220;justified the wasting of police resources, time and taxpayer money on investigating the vexatious charge&#8221;.</p>
<p>The police u-turn has been described as &#8220;a &#8220;sweet <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/11/darren-grimes-investigated-stirring-racial-hatred-patently/">victory&#8221; for free speech </a>and for the &#8220;cause of liberty&#8221;.</p>
<p>The conservative commentator and the historian were being investigated over a podcast published on Mr Grimes&#8217; Reasoned UK YouTube channel on June 30, in which Dr Starkey had said that slavery was not a genocide as there are &#8220;so many damn blacks&#8221;.</p>
<p>The investigation into Mr Grimes for a public order offence&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/09/darren-grimes-police-investigation-david-starkey-interview/">was first revealed by the&#160;Telegraph </a>on the evening of Friday 9 October, with Scotland Yard&#8217;s press team apparently unaware of the potentially explosive case. By Monday, after a weekend of backlash over the impact the investigation could have on free speech, the Metropolitan Police had appointed a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/14/police-set-review-investigation-darren-grimes-david-starkey/">senior officer to review the investigation</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Grimes and Dr Starkey were informed days later that the case was on hold and they would not be required to attend an interview. Both men have now been informed the investigation into them has been dropped.</p>
<p>Mr Grimes said: &#8220;I am delighted to be free from months, if not years, of yet more legal drama occupying my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the fact that it was allowed to reach this point, the fact that a precedent has been set that says that a broadcaster or journalist can face police arrest and a maximum of seven years prison time for interviewing a controversial guest is truly chilling indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will still seek the CPS advice that justified the wasting of police resources, time and taxpayer money on investigating the vexatious charge that I "stirred up" racial hatred in the first place and the unprecedented use of the Public Order Act to regulate speech and debate.&#8221;</p>

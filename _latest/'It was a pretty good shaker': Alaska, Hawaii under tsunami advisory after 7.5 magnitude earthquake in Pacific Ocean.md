  'It was a pretty good shaker': Alaska, Hawaii under tsunami advisory after 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Pacific Ocean 
description: > 
  A magnitude 7.5 earthquake jolted Alaska's southern coast on Monday afternoon, triggering a tsunami warning for The Last Frontier and a tsunami advisory nearly 2,500 miles away in Hawaii.The tsunami warning was downgraded about two hours later to an advisory that remained in effect into Monday night.A magnitude 5.2 quake was reported 11 minutes later in roughly the same area, according to the earthquake center.Wave levels reached 2 feet along Alaska's southern coast, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center.â€œThis is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate.

The&#160;tsunami warning was downgraded about two hours later to an advisory that remained in effect into Monday night.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;It was a pretty good shaker here,&#8221; said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. &#8220;You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A magnitude 5.2 quake was reported 11 minutes later in roughly the same area, according to the earthquake center. Wave levels reached 2 feet along Alaska's southern coast, according to the&#160;National Tsunami Warning Center.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">About six hours after the first temblor, the tsunami center issued an advisory for the state of Hawaii and cautioned that "the&#160;threat may continue for several hours after the initial wave arrival."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But, in its advisory, the center stressed that&#160;a "major tsunami is not expected."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The size of the initial quake was originally reported as a 7.4, but later revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of that&#160;size, in this area, is not a surprise.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,&#8221; Caruso said, noting that&#8217;s why there are volcanoes in the region. &#8220;And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/22/alaska-earthquake-tsunami-warning/5484967002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">A 7.8 earthquake in July also prompted a tsunami warning</a> for Alaska's southern coast that sent some residents inland for higher ground before an all-clear from the tsunami center.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Contributing: The Associated Press</p></div>

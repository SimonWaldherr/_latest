<div><p>Of course, relative merits and demerits of having a regional accent is a tired subject written about to death. As is classism at universities. And, yes, it certainly works the other way around too. Those who speak with received pronunciation or are from the home counties certainly aren&#8217;t immune to assumptions about their background or accusations of being <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/02/19/life-has-much-smoother-since-adopted-posh-accent/">&#8216;posh</a>&#8217;.&#160;</p>
<p>The difference, however, is that prejudices against the North and, in fact, almost any region outside of the South East goes further than jokes and name-calling, infiltrating students&#8217; prospects in serious ways.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Thompson, a final year student on a Wildlife Media degree at the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/0/university-of-cumbria-guide/">University of Cumbria</a>, originally from Formby, explains that she felt her tutors would look down on her for her Liverpudlian accent, dismissing her ideas while celebrating Southern classmates for making the same or similar points.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I thought it was me being sensitive but then my classmates began commenting on the way one tutor spoke to me,&#8221; says Thompson. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t hidden or underlying; it was right in my face for everyone to see.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Thompson claims that during a complaint meeting, course heads told her that similar complaints had been made about the tutor (and not just by students) but ultimately dismissed her concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate speaking in public now,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been too&#160;scared to apply for graduate jobs in the south in case I find the same stigma. Frankly, I don&#8217;t think I could mentally handle much more of being put down for a reason I cannot help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cork describes how Durham&#8217;s careers service catered almost exclusively for students looking for jobs in the South East, making him doubt his decision to look for a career in the North.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was graduating and applying for jobs, people found it quite strange and unexpected that I wanted to stay in the North and not move down to London,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They treated it as though you can't be successful if you're in the North of England, which I just don't think is true at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>White has called on Durham to provide more support for Northern students, but these problems go further than one institution. It&#8217;s past time universities start to engage with the fact that many students feel disenfranchised from the moment they open their mouths.&#160;</p>

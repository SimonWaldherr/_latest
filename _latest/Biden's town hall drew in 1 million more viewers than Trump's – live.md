The California GOP has agreed not to place its own unauthorized ballot boxes that the state deemed illegal, election officials just announced.

The state Republican party sparked national scrutiny this week after installing their own unofficial ballot drop-boxes in Los Angeles, Orange and Fresno counties, raising concerns about potential fraud and voter confusion.

County election officials are responsible for official drop-boxes, and experts said it was misleading and potentially unlawful to install Republican-controlled boxes that voters could mistake for legitimate collection sites.

After GOP officials publicly pledged to keep their boxes up and defy a cease-and-desist order, the Republican party agreed “they will not make available or condone the use of unstaffed, unsecured unofficial ballot drop boxes”, the secretary of state, Alex Padilla, said in a statement.

California law does allow groups to collect and deliver ballots on voters’ behalf if the voters give permission, but the state has said it is unlawful to install unattended boxes and to misrepresent them as “official”.

The GOP has admitted that one of their boxes was labeled “official” in error, but has defended their ballot collection efforts, and argued that Democratic election leaders have misrepresented their activities.

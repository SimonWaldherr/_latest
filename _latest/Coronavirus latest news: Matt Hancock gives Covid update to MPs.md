<div><p>Greater Manchester could run out of intensive care beds "very soon" without further restrictions, a BMA committee chair has warned.</p>
<p>Dr Indy Kapila, Intensive Care Consultant, chair&#160;of the&#160;North West Regional Consultants Committee of the British Medical Association, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the Greater Manchester area has around 270 ICU beds.</p>
<p>"I would say the current situation is very concerning, we do have capacity at the moment but it's very hard to predict how things are likely to go over the next week or so.</p>
<p>"We are seeing rising numbers of admissions to hospital and to intensive care," he said.</p>
<p>Figures from Friday revealed admissions had increased by around 90&#160; to 100 patients, Dr Kapila said.</p>
<p>"We do still have capacity currently&#160;but given the infection rates in Manchester, we have about 440 cases per 100,000&#160;which is extremely high, we are very concerned that we may reach a situation very soon where intensive care beds will run out," he added.</p>
<p>Dr Kapila went on to add that increased restrictions were needed, but suggested those which would come into force with a Tier 3 lockdown may not be strong enough.</p>

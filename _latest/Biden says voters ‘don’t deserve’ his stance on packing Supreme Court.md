Voters don’t “deserve” to know Joe Biden’s stance on packing the Supreme Court, the Democratic nominee said this week.

In a prickly interview with a Las Vegas news station Friday, the Biden doubled down on his refusal to say whether he supports expanding the highest court in the land to more than nine justices.

“This is the number one thing that I’ve been asked about from viewers in the last couple of days,” began KTNV’s Ross DiMattei.

“Well, you’ve been asked by the viewers who are probably Republicans,” Biden sarcastically responded.

“Don’t the voters deserve to know where you stand on …” DiMattei continued.

“No, they don’t deserve,” Biden snapped. “I’m not going to play his game.”

Biden claimed his position on packing is a non-issue, but Trump is making it one to “to take the eye off the ball — change the subject.”

“He’d love [packing] to be the discussion,” Biden added.

On Thursday, the former vice president said he would not talk about his court-packing stance because it would become a headline if he did.

That came one day after his running mate, Kamala Harris, refused to answer direct questions about packing the court during her debate with Vice President Mike Pence.

Top Democrats in Congress, including House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), have threatened to add more justices to the Supreme Court to thwart the 6-3 majority that conservatives will have if Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s nominee, is confirmed to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s seat on the bench.

  Britain by numbers: the surprising ONS statistics that reveal our nation's past and present 
description: > 
  The great scientist Lord Kelvin once said that “if you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it”.Britain has a long tradition of measuring things about the life of the country with a view to improving them, and this tradition has, among other things, led to the introduction of a national census every decade and the creation of the Office for National Statistics.Having looked in detail at the 1921 and 2021 censuses, it was only logical to wonder what a 2121 census would find (not that there will be an official census by then, but anyway).Statistics can sometimes seem a little dry, but numbers on censuses both bygone and current always represent real people and their myriad lives: snapshots of Britain past, present and future.Census Day next year is on Sunday March 21 2021 in England and Wales.

The great scientist Lord Kelvin once said that “if you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it”. Britain has a long tradition of measuring things about the life of the country with a view to improving them, and this tradition has, among other things, led to the introduction of a national census every decade and the creation of the Office for National Statistics.

It was figures from both sources which David Bradbury and I used in writing our book, The Official History of Britain, and in doing so we tried to chart the ways in which Britain has changed since the first census in 1801: who we are, what we do and where we live.

Next year’s census will be the first to take account of the coronavirus pandemic, a public health crisis that has seen the ONS at its best in meeting an unprecedented demand from government, media and the public for statistics that are rapid, reliable and non-partisan.

It is a neat coincidence that the 2021 census (the first to be online by default, though the traditional paper forms will still be available for those who like to keep things old school) takes place exactly a century after the 1921 census, which also dealt with the seismic social changes caused by Spanish flu and the First World War.

Having looked in detail at the 1921 and 2021 censuses, it was only logical to wonder what a 2121 census would find (not that there will be an official census by then, but anyway).

If the other sections had allowed me to make good use of my history degree for the first time in almost three decades, this one gave free rein to my novelist’s imagination – including farmscrapers, a south coast conurbation called Solentside, and a split between traditional births and ectogenetic ones via artificial wombs.

Statistics can sometimes seem a little dry, but numbers on censuses both bygone and current always represent real people and their myriad lives: snapshots of Britain past, present and future.

Census Day next year is on Sunday March 21 2021 in England and Wales. Filling in the returns is not an idle exercise in governmental curiosity: it’s helping ensure that the country has the information it needs to target its resources more effectively and to plan services such as housing, education, health and transport.

WASHINGTON — A Senate committee is investigating a bombshell cache of documents about Hunter Biden’s foreign dealings acquired by a Delaware computer repairman and exposed Wednesday by The Post.

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee confirmed it is working with the repairman, whose identity was confirmed by The Post, to verify the documents.

An email from the cache indicates Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden met with Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, while it employed his son. At the time, Biden led the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy.

Biden said last year, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” including his reported $83,000 monthly pay on Burisma’s board.

House Democrats impeached President Trump in December for asking Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden’s employment.

The repairman contacted the committee in late September — one day after it released a report on Joe Biden’s apparent conflicts of interest in his son’s international business dealings, including a claim he received $3.5 million from the wife of Moscow’s former mayor.

The repairman provided correspondence to The Post documenting his outreach to the committee.

He spoke on Oct. 5 with three members of the committee’s staff.

A spokesman for the committee’s chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), confirmed to The Post that the committee is investigating.

“We regularly speak with individuals who email the committee’s whistleblower account to determine whether we can validate their claims,” the Johnson spokesman said.

“Although we consider those communications to be confidential, because the individual in this instance spoke with the media about his contact with the committee, we can confirm receipt of his email complaint. We have been in contact with the whistleblower and are in the process of attempting to validate the information he provided.”

Kamala Harris suggested the former vice president will go high.</p><p class="">Asked Wednesday how her running mate was preparing for the debate and likely personal attacks from the president, Harris told reporters in North Carolina,&#160;&#8220;You know, one of the things I love about Joe Biden ... he doesn't take on or talk about other people's kids.&#8220;</p><p class="">During their <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/first-presidential-debate-highlights-between-trump-and-biden-92825157635" target="_blank">first debate</a> last month, Biden appeared to restrain himself after Trump questioned the younger Biden's business dealings. After saying "my son did nothing wrong" at the energy company where he'd worked, Biden said, "We want talk about families and ethics? I don't want to do that &#8212;&#160;his family we could talk about all night," referring to the Trump family.</p><p class="">Biden then reined himself in, turned to the camera and said, "This is not about my family or his family. This is about your family &#8212; the American people." Trump "doesn't want to talk about what you need," Biden said.</p><ul class="socialList___2GQsY js-social-share"><li class="socialListText___2j4a7 founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="socialListIcon___9xobL"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-21-trump-biden-election-n1244076/ncrd1244171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><p class="icon icon-facebook socialIcon___HgLMt"></p></a></li><li class="socialListIcon___9xobL"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ahead%20of%20the%20debate%2C%20Harris%20says%20Biden%20doesn't%20talk%20'about%20other%20people's%20kids'&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-21-trump-biden-election-n1244076/ncrd1244171&amp;original_referer=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-21-trump-biden-election-n1244076/ncrd1244171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><p class="icon icon-twitter socialIcon___HgLMt"></p></a></li><li class="socialListIcon___9xobL"><a href="mailto:?subject=Ahead%20of%20the%20debate,%20Harris%20says%20Biden%20doesn't%20talk%20'about%20other%20people's%20kids'&amp;body=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-21-trump-biden-election-n1244076/ncrd1244171"><p class="icon icon-email socialIcon___HgLMt"></p></a></li></ul><p class="stripePattern___OwIMU"></p><h2 class="cardTitle___2kTZx">Loeffler's challenger casts his ballot in Atlanta</h2><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p class="caption__container"></p><p class="caption__source">Elijah Nouvelage / Getty Images</p><p class="">Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock, who is hoping to unseat Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, waits in line at State Farm Arena to cast his ballot Wednesday in Atlanta.</p><p class=""><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/sen-loeffler-under-fire-free-all-georgia-senate-special-election-n1243976" target="_blank">Warnock has assailed Loeffler</a> for associating herself with a congressional candidate who has embraced baseless&#160;QAnon conspiracy theories&#160;and made racist remarks.</p><ul class="socialList___2GQsY js-social-share"><li class="socialListText___2j4a7 founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="socialListIcon___9xobL"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-21-trump-biden-election-n1244076/ncrd1244169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><p class="icon icon-facebook socialIcon___HgLMt"></p></a></li><li class="socialListIcon___9xobL"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Loeffler's%20challenger%20casts%20his%20ballot%20in%20Atlanta&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-21-trump-biden-election-n1244076/ncrd1244169&amp;original_referer=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-21-trump-biden-election-n1244076/ncrd1244169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><p class="icon icon-twitter socialIcon___HgLMt"></p></a></li><li class="socialListIcon___9xobL"><a href="mailto:?subject=Loeffler's%20challenger%20casts%20his%20ballot%20in%20Atlanta&amp;body=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-21-trump-biden-election-n1244076/ncrd1244169"><p class="icon icon-email socialIcon___HgLMt"></p></a></li></ul><p class="stripePattern___OwIMU"></p><h2 class="cardTitle___2kTZx">N.H. attorney general rejects state GOP's request to bar remote college students from absentee voting</h2><p class="">New Hampshire's attorney general has rejected the state Republican party&#8217;s request to stop remote college students from absentee voting.</p><p class="">Once a student establishes residence in the state, &#8220;the student does not lose his or her domicile due to temporary absence," the attorney general's office wrote in a letter to state and party leaders that it released to NBC News.</p><p class="">The statement upheld guidance from the state&#8217;s Democratic Party on the right of university students studying virtually outside of New Hampshire to vote in the state.&#160;The state Democratic Party praised the attorney general&#8217;s response.</p><p class="">"New&#160;Hampshire&#160;Republicans&#160;are so&#160;scared to face&#160;voters&#160;with&#160;their plots to repeal health care and overturn Roe v.

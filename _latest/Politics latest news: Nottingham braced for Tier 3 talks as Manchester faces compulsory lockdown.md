<p>Nottingham&#8217;s leaders are braced to start negotiations with the Government over Tier 3 restrictions, as the deadline for an agreement to be reached in Manchester looms.&#160;</p>
<p>Some 2,368 new cases were recorded in the student city over the seven days to October 15 &#8211; the equivalent of 711.3 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in the country.&#160;</p>
<p>Council leader David Mellen said: "I am expecting to meet with Government this week as they consider whether we should be placed under Tier 3 restrictions. I will make it clear that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for Tier 2 or Tier 3, and will need to speak to the Government first about the details of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talks are expected to begin once those in Greater Manchester have wrapped up. Last night&#160; Andy Burnham and his colleagues were given an ultimatum to agree a compromise by midday today or have restrictions imposed unilaterally.&#160;</p>
<p>This morning the Mayor accused the Government of &#8220;penny pinching&#8221; and "responding to the pandemic on the cheap&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>Other towns and regions in the North are also on the official hit list for further restrictions, however ministers can expect plenty of push-back.&#160;</p>
<p>Hartlepool Borough Council leader Shane Moore last night said he would tell officials to &#8220;sod off&#8221; if they tried to impose Tier 3 restrictions on his region.&#160;</p>

"Testing rates are still far too low, and care homes need support from public health and NHS to rectify that. Protecting care homes properly would have been the easiest way to reduce the death toll in the spring. The sector cannot be let down a second time."

The data also showed that there is no evidence of a rise in infections in care homes, mirroring that seen in the wider community in many areas of the UK.

Despite a summer of testing, roughly one fifth of residents (22 per cent) have not been tested since the end of May, when the Government pledged to have a more thorough Covid-19 testing regime in elderly care homes in England.

"Care homes need access to test kits but also stronger and more consistent local guidance if they are to achieve universal testing," T-DAB warned.

More than 15,000 care home residents have died of the virus, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data.

The Telegraph reported on Wednesday that care homes have been told they will be expected to make room for coronavirus patients who have been discharged from hospital despite the policy being blamed for the spread of the virus at the peak of the pandemic.

A letter from the DHSC to providers urging them to prepare "isolation" facilities was leaked to The Telegraph, sparking concern from carers on the front line.

Gaynor Saunders, who chairs the Independent Sector Liaison Group for care providers in Wakefield and the Hull and East Riding Care Association, said: "This decision, as with every other the Government makes, shows that they are just floundering around in the dark and every solution is just sticking plasters on top of plasters on top of plasters. They're being reactive, rather than proactive."

A DHSC spokesman said: "This study accounts for only 10 per cent of care home residents in England and is not an accurate reflection of care home testing. All CQC registered adult care homes can access tests for asymptomatic staff and residents, and we have sent out over 10 million test kits to care homes so far."

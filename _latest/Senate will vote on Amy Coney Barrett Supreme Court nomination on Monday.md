<div><p>WASHINGTON &#8212; The Senate will vote Monday on whether to confirm <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/democrats-enraged-as-feinstein-graham-hug-romney-assures-barrett/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Amy Coney Barrett</a> to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced the vote on President Trump&#8217;s nominee to the court after Barrett&#8217;s grilling by Senate Judiciary Committee lawmakers during <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/12/democrats-turn-acb-hearing-into-emotional-obamacare-appeal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four days of hearings</a> last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to the Supreme Court justice, we&#8217;ll be voting to confirm Justice-to-be Barrett next Monday,&#8221; McConnell said, appearing bullish about the conservative judge&#8217;s confirmation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that will be another signature accomplishment in our effort to put on the courts, the federal courts, men and women that believe in the quaint notion that maybe the job of a judge is to actually follow the law,&#8221; he went on.</p>
<p>Barrett, 48, is a favorite among religious conservatives <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/26/amy-coney-barrett-woman-of-faith-who-says-religion-has-no-place-in-rulings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">given her views</a> and, if confirmed, would become Trump&#8217;s third justice on the nine-person bench.</p>
<p>With Republicans in control of the Senate, Barrett&#8217;s appointment to the highest court in the land is nearly certain &#8212; anguishing Democratic lawmakers who argue she would vote to dismantle ObamaCare and Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>The death of liberal icon <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/18/supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead-at-87/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> last month has thrust the Supreme Court into the center of the heated presidential campaign.</p>
 
<p>Democrats, including vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris of California, have floated packing the Supreme Court if Barrett is confirmed before the Nov. 3 election.</p>
<p>However, both Joe Biden and Harris <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/joe-biden-still-wont-answer-on-court-packing-depends-on-how-it-turns-out/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have refused to say</a> where they stand on the issue, angering critics and even some allies who say US voters have a right to know that.</p>

  'I'm the one': Philippines president takes responsibility for drug killings 
description: > 
  The killing of nearly 6,000 drug suspects have been reported by police but rights watchdogs suspect the death toll is far higher.“If there’s killing there, I’m saying I’m the one ... you can hold me responsible for anything, any death that has occurred in the execution of the drug war,” Duterte said.The ICC prosecutor has said the examination into the drug killings would continue despite the Philippine withdrawal.Police have reported at least 5,856 drug suspects have been killed in raids and more than 256,000 others arrested since the start of the crackdown.Duterte said drug killings that did not happen during police operations should not be blamed on him, adding those deaths may have been set off by gang rivalries or settling of scores.

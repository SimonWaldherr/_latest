  Biden's Amtrak trips prompt House GOP questions on costs, impact on railroad operations 
description: > 
  Now, some House Republicans are seeking data on Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's use of the train service during his campaign."Given that the Biden campaign declined to disclose what it paid to use Amtrak’s resources, we want to ensure that the campaign paid a full, non-discounted rate," the letter added.The GOP lawmakers specifically requested information on the total amount paid to Amtrak for the Biden charter train, and how much it cost the railroad company to operate it.According to a September Federal Election Commission report, the Biden campaign reportedly paid $265,000 to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, the entity that operates Amtrak.Biden’s three decades serving Delaware as a U.S. senator saw him take an Amtrak train each morning to the nation’s capital, and return each evening, to be with his family.

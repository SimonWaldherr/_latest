<div><p>It&#8217;s been less than two weeks since a California Republican Party staff member posted a photo on Twitter of himself kneeling next to a dark metal container with a homemade sign that labeled it as an &#8220;Official Ballot Drop Off Box.&#8221;</p><p><a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-13/california-gop-defends-unofficial-ballot-boxes" target="_blank">It was not an official receptacle</a>.

<p>The answer is unclear, which is the subject of <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-14/california-gop-republicans-ballot-boxes-unofficial" target="_blank">a back-and-forth quarrel between state officials and GOP attorneys and activists</a>, highlighting the permissiveness and imprecision of California&#8217;s ballot collection laws.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>The week begins with what feels like two different conversations over the same topic, after dueling news conferences on Friday &#8212; <b>Secretary of State Alex Padilla</b> and <b>Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra</b> on one side, California Republican Party leaders on the other.</p><p>Padilla told reporters on Friday that GOP officials had agreed to &#8220;no longer deploy these unstaffed, unsecured, unofficial and unauthorized ballot drop boxes.&#8221; And investigators from Becerra&#8217;s office <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-16/la-me-california-gop-ballot-box-attorney-general-secretary-of-state" target="_blank">issued subpoenas seeking more information</a> on GOP ballot collection activities.</p><p>But Republican leaders insisted they had followed the rules and dismissed the &#8220;official&#8221; signs as the work of overzealous staffers that had been removed. And they fired back at Padilla and Becerra, insisting the two prominent Democrats had been overzealous in their accusations and had never launched similar inquiries into ballot collection efforts by Democratic groups.</p><p>Two election laws are at the crux of this debate. The first is <a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1921" target="_blank">a 2016 law</a> that removed the long-standing rule that only a family member could deliver a voter&#8217;s ballot. The second, <a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB306" target="_blank">enacted in 2018</a>, clarified that most failures of a ballot collector to follow the rules would not stop the voter&#8217;s ballot from being counted.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

    </p>
<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>State officials, for now, have focused on improper ballot collection, not the boxes being used by GOP activists as long as the containers are supervised. And no one seemed able to answer what penalty might exist if the person collecting the ballot failed to provide the information required on the outside of the absentee envelope &#8212; especially vexing in populous Contra Costa County, which removed the space on the envelope for a collector&#8217;s information in 2016.</p><p><b>Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez</b> (D-San Diego), the author of the law removing limits on collection practices now derided by critics as &#8220;ballot harvesting,&#8221; said it&#8217;s possible lawmakers should take a closer look next year at new, detailed chain of custody rules. But she insisted it would be wrong to do anything that created new barriers for voters.</p><p>&#8220;We have to rely on the judgment of the voter,&#8221; she said in an interview on Friday.<br></p><h2 id="3-million-california-ballots-and-counting" class="subhead">3 million California ballots and counting</h2>
<p>As of the end of last week, the ballots cast by 14% of California&#8217;s registered voters had been received by elections officials. That&#8217;s almost three times the number of ballots <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-14/1-million-mail-in-ballots-cast-california-2020-election" target="_blank">that had been received earlier in the week</a>, suggesting an acceleration of activity and sure to grow much larger this week.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

    </p>
<p>Information collected by the firm Political Data shows Californians older than 65 are outperforming the statewide average &#8212; with 25% of those voters having returned their ballots. On the other end of the spectrum, only 8% of voters age 34 and younger had participated as of the end of the week. Los Angeles County represents about one-fifth of the ballots cast so far, underperforming its share of the state&#8217;s registered voters.</p><p class="infobox-title">Enjoying this newsletter?

Some 1.8m jobs are at risk despite the Chancellor’s package of support for jobs as Boris Johnson prepares to put the North back into lockdown, a think tank has warned.

The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) claims that when the furlough scheme ends at the end of this month, the replacement measures Rishi Sunak announced on Friday will not be sufficient to incentivise firms to retain staff – saving only 230,000 jobs.

The think tank urged the Treasury to redesign the Job Retention Bonus, which offers employers an extra £1,000 for keeping furloughed staff on until January, and the Job Support Scheme, which will pay two-thirds of each employee's salary up to £2,100 a month.

They are flawed because only workers earning between £625 and £987 a month are expected to benefit – only about a tenth of workers currently on furlough, according to the IPPR.

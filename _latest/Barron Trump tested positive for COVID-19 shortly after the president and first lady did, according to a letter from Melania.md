Barron Trump tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after his parents did, First Lady Melania Trump disclosed on Wednesday.

The 14-year old initially tested negative for the virus, according to the White House.

"My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms," the first lady wrote in a White House blog post. He has since tested negative.

On Wednesday when asked about his son, President Donald Trump said he's "fine."

Barron Trump, President Donald Trump's 14-year-old son, tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after his parents did, according to a White House blog post from First Lady Melania Trump.

"Naturally my mind went immediately to our son," the first lady wrote of her reaction to she and Trump testing positive. "To our great relief he tested negative, but again, as so many parents have thought over the past several months, I couldn't help but think 'what about tomorrow or the next day?'"

"My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms."

The first lady said her son has since tested negative for the virus.

"In one way I was glad the three of us went through this at the same time so we could take care of one another and spend time together," she wrote.

When asked about his youngest son on Wednesday, Trump replied: "Barron's fine," then pivoted to speaking about his Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings taking place this week.

Trump announced he and the first lady tested positive for the disease on October 2, though his exact infection timeline remains uncertain.

Barron's initial negative test result was revealed by the White House when a spokeswoman confirmed it to USA Today that same day, but Melania's blog post on Wednesday was the first time a positive test result for the teenager was disclosed.

The first lady also said she approached her treatment differently than her husband's, with the president taking a variety of therapeutics including an experimental antibody cocktail from Regeneron.

"I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food," the first lady wrote. "We had wonderful caretakers around us and we will be forever grateful for the medical care and professional discretion we received from Dr. Conley and his team."

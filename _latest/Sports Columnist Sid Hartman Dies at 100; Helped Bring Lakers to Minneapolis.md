"I want to make it clear&#8212;he didn't die from COVID&#8212;but COVID took away the enjoyment from his life by making him stay home. It took away the chance to see the people he liked. It took away his zest, not being able to go four, five different places every day and to laugh, to get on people and have them get on him."</p><p class="">Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Ryan Saunders also <a href="https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/statement-ryan-saunders-sid-hartman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement</a>:</p><p id="br-ad-29245129" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">"Its hard to put into words what Sid meant to my family and me. He was resilient, positive, and worked effortlessly to develop meaningful relationships that gave millions of readers a glimpse into the world he loved.&#160;</p><p class="">"Having known my parents since they were teens, Sid really was a 'close personal friend' and was always a voice of reason, stability and familiarity. I will remember Sid fondly as he embraced my family in a way that only Sid Hartman could. As long as I can remember, he&#8217;s always been someone I trusted not just as a friend but as a journalist who did everything with integrity.</p><p class="">"Sid was a remarkable example of living life to the fullest and finding your passion &#8211; may we all learn from the legacy he leaves."</p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png">Video Play Button</a><p class="atom video-indicator"><p class="text">Videos you might like </p> </p><p class="">Hartman spent nearly his entire life in the newspaper business, starting out by selling newspapers at age eight before eventually becoming one of the most influential figures in Minnesota sports history. He was instrumental in bringing Major League Baseball to Minneapolis and helped the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nba">NBA</a>'s Minneapolis Lakers in personnel decisions.</p><p class="">By Hartman's own estimate, he was at least partially responsible for the Lakers' success throughout the early years of the NBA.</p><p class="">But despite working directly with pro sports teams, Hartman was best known for his work in the media, which he continued until the day he died. Hartman filed a column in the&#160;Star Tribune&#160;on Sunday, which was his 119th of the 2020 calendar year.</p><p class="">"Sid's contributions to the Star Tribune during nearly half of its 153-year history are immeasurable," Star Tribune publisher Michael Klingensmith said Sunday.

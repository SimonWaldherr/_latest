description: > 
  Mookie Betts led off the bottom of the fifth inning with a walk against Tyler Glasnow and stole second base before Corey Seager worked his third walk of the game, prompting a visit to the mound by Rays pitching coach Kyle Snyder.With Ryan Yarbrough warming in the bullpen, Glasnow struck out Justin Turner on his 103rd pitch of the game, as Betts and Seager pulled off a double steal to move into scoring position.Max Muncy followed with a one-hopper to first base, which Yandy Diaz fielded and threw home, but Betts slid in safely ahead of catcher Mike Zunino’s tag to give the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.Will Smith then singled to center, scoring Seager and ending Glasnow’s night.It’ll be Yarbrough to face Cody Bellinger with runners on first and third and still only one out.

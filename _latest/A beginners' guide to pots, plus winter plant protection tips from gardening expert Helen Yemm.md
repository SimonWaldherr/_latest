<p>This week&#8217;s Back to Basics was triggered by the sight of a container (the centrepiece of a small front garden), crammed with assorted winter-appropriate pretties, that had fallen over. It was slim and tall (30in at least) and was made of shiny &#8220;galvanised&#8221; metal. This prompted a few dos, don&#8217;ts, tips and bewares about some of the most popular ornamental plant pots, starting with&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Galvanised metal</strong></p>
<p>Personally, I think that with metal containers &#8220;old and battered&#8221; is more appealing than &#8220;shiny and new&#8221;, but only those (pricier ones) that are double-walled are plant-friendly. The rest need insulating against both heat and cold with a bubble wrap lining &#8211; without blocking vital drainage holes. These pots are incredibly light, so while tall metal pots don&#8217;t need to be completely filled with compost (to a depth that plant roots will never reach), they will need heavy ballast in the base to stabilise them.</p>
<p><strong>Ceramic</strong></p>
<p>These are good value, usefully heavy/stable and non-porous, so plant roots stay reasonably moist. But many are unduly garish, it has to be said. The simplest, darkest, and most discreet pots ensure that the plants themselves are the stars.</p>
<p><strong>Terracotta</strong></p>
<p>Rough and mellow terracotta pots, the bigger the better, are highly prized, age subtly and, along with reconstituted stone containers, lend a gentle touch of &#8220;ancient&#8221; or &#8220;grand&#8221; to any garden, large or small.</p>
<p>Modern, smooth machine-made terracotta or stone pots may be a lot cheaper and are usually tougher but are slow to age (although dunking them in a garden pond for six months accelerates the process). Big plants in big pots need to have the top layer of compost replaced/replenished annually, since repotting is obviously not a job to be undertaken lightly. Owners of such pots inevitably end up buying a wheeled pot-trolley (several available on Amazon).</p>
<p><strong>Wood</strong></p>
<p>Probably the most plant-friendly material as it doesn&#8217;t conduct heat and retains moisture. When drilling holes for drainage, site them near the base of the sides, rather than in the bottom. Re-cycled oak barrels last as planters for up to 10 years but are difficult to move as they become fragile with age. Line treated softwood troughs with old compost bags to lengthen their life.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beware narrow-necked tulip-shaped pots, you will never extract a plant intact.</li>
<li>Never use a pot that does not have a drainage hole, thinking you won&#8217;t overwater the plant. You will.</li>
<li>A layer of crocks at the bottom of a pot is not vital, but you should partially block oversized drainage holes with a large pebble and stand pots on saucers of gravel (indoors and out).</li>
<li>Remove saucers under outdoor pots in winter to ensure that roots don&#8217;t become waterlogged.</li>
<li>A layer of gravel to cover the surface of the compost deters vine weevils from laying eggs and helps keep in moisture.</li>
<li>And compost? Use a loam-based one with a little added grit (eg John Innes No. 3) or peat-free multipurpose (depending on the needs of the proposed resident). But that is another story for another week.</li>
</ul>

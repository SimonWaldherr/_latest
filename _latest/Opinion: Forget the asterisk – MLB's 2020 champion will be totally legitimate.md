With Major League Baseball’s expanded playoff nearly whittled down to a final four, it’s time to make one thing clear.

There’s no need for any asterisk.

That symbol has dogged the game for more than a century, tied in an almost mythical sense to scandal or, often length of schedule. So it was natural, perhaps even appropriate, that fans and media wondered aloud if this 60-game season, and the 16-team playoff that followed, would require unofficially affixing that star-like character to the 2020 champion.

You can understand why: Baseball is best served over 162 games and comes with an often-unspoken understanding that even in normal, non-pandemic seasons, the game’s greatest team is sometimes not determined by a more random playoff that requires just 11 or 12 victories over a month to claim the championship.

Throw in a regular season barely one-third its usual size and invite a pair of sub-.500 teams to the 16-team dance, and let the handwringing begin.

But now that we’re here, and we know that only one of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros and New York Yankees or Tampa Bay Rays will claim the title, it’s safe to say a legitimate champion will be crowned.

MLB PLAYOFFS: Full postseason schedule

ASTROS: Houston bashes its way to fourth consecutive ALCS

Call it luck or the surprising efficacy of a best-of-three wild-card round, but the pretenders have been dismissed. A September hot streak that can elevate a clearly flawed club to the postseason wasn’t enough to topple a top seed (sorry, Toronto). An entire division of punchless pretenders mostly hovering around .500 was sent packing (see you in February, Cubs and Cardinals and Reds and Brewers).

And yes, even America’s Team, a squad that overcame the loss of 18 players three games into the season due to the coronavirus probably wasn’t fit to serve as champions of baseball (though we will miss you, Miami Marlins).

But wait, you say, there remains a sub-.500 team in the field. Worse yet, it’s America’s Antiheroes, the cheatin’ Houston Astros, who still feature several protagonists from their trash-can banging scheme on the way to the 2017 World Series title.

Yet as we sit on the verge of the AL and NL championship series, the Astros’ 29-31 regular season becomes more of a distant memory, a small and likely unrepresentative sample of their true level.

It’s also impossible to ignore what they’ve done since: Win five of six games, all away from Minute Maid Park, including a brisk two-game sweep of the 36-24 Twins in which the AL Central champs scored just two runs.

After their four-game dismissal of the Oakland A’s in the ALDS, the Astros have now taken out the Nos. 2 and 3 seeds in the AL. And if you add their 5-1 playoff record to their overall mark, suddenly, they’re not a 29-31 team but rather a 34-32 team, healthy and trending upward.

Funny how these small-sample seasons work, eh?

While most baseball seasons are best viewed as individual entities, this year’s unique circumstances compel us to view every team’s accomplishments in a deeper context. In short, track records matter.

And the remaining teams are anything but Johnny-come-latelies.

The Rays were coming off 90- and 96-win seasons and backed that up by winning two-thirds of their games this year. The Yankees added Gerrit Cole to a club that won 100 and 103 games in 2018-19. They were a solid 33-27 and, in these playoffs, are showing how potent they are when both Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton are healthy. The Astros have advanced to their fourth consecutive ALCS, their 2020 accomplishments achieved far away from Minute Maid Park.

The Braves? Merely back-to-back-to-back NL East champions, only now with a true October shutdown starter in Ian Anderson.

And then there are the Dodgers.

The eight-time NL West champions are four wins from their third trip to the finals in four years, only this time with the great Mookie Betts in tow. As the season began, you could sense trepidation or relish, depending on whether you loved or hated the Dodgers, that the club waited 32 years to break its World Series drought, only to do so in a bastardized and truncated season that proved nothing.

Well, that concept has been put to rest.

The Dodgers went 43-17, a .717 winning percentage that computes to 116 wins over a full season, and outscored opponents 349-213. There’s also no reason to use 2020’s fully regional schedule against them: West teams won all four of their wild-card matchups and might have more teams standing if they didn’t play each other in the AL and NL Division Series.

In these playoffs, the Dodgers are 5-0 against the Brewers and Padres, and besting a very good Braves team, followed by the AL survivor, would leave them with nothing for which to apologize.

Lest we forget, the conditions under which this season is being contested provides its own hurdle.

The myriad Division Series celebrations were a combination of joy and relief, mixing the stress of a short series with the cumulative strain of living and competing within stringent COVID-19 protocols since early July.

“Every once in a while, I sit back and say, 'how in the hell are we doing this?' ” Braves manager Brian Snitker said in the aftermath of his team’s NLDS clincher against the Marlins. “This has been tough on the whole industry. We’re down to the final four which is really good, for what we’ve had to overcome as a sport.

“My hat’s off to the entire game.”

“It’s taken everybody,” says Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, shouting out his club’s medical and training personnel and support staff. “Everyone’s gone above and beyond. It’s a unique year and in a weird way, has galvanized a lot of us.”

In less than three weeks, provided the participants successfully keep COVID-19 at bay, someone will be declared a champion.

History should note that their title comes with few, if any, caveats.

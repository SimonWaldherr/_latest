  How I raked in £6,500 selling my designer wardrobe during lockdown 
description: > 
  Since March, I have dressed simply in jeans and soft knits, which has left many of my “saved for best” pieces feeling more and more redundant by the day.I decided to do something radical: to sell the neglected treasures of my wardrobe on various designer resale websites.To raise funds, to recycle and to start afresh with a new attitude to shopping that is more conscientious and considered.I attacked the wardrobe in a frenzy, flinging out forgotten-about dresses, jumpers, coats and jackets ready to sell.Eventually, I started the selling process with a never worn Self Portrait evening dress – a bit of a Disney princess number with multiple layers and lashings of sequins; so not exactly quarantine comfort-wear.

<div><p>Since March, I have dressed simply in jeans and soft knits, which has left many of my &#8220;saved for best&#8221; pieces feeling more and more redundant by the day. I decided to do something radical: to sell the neglected treasures of my wardrobe on various designer resale websites. My goal? To raise funds, to recycle and to start afresh with a new attitude to shopping that is more conscientious and considered.</p>
<p>Day one of this mission was cathartic. I approached the task with the demonic gusto of Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest only without the frightened child and the wire hanger obsession &#8211; I prefer a nice wooden one. I attacked the wardrobe in a frenzy, flinging out forgotten-about dresses, jumpers, coats and jackets ready to sell. By day two, separation anxiety set in, followed by frustration.</p>
<p>Once you take stock of the money you&#8217;ve spent on this pile of stuff,&#160;you&#8217;re faced with some shocking cost-per-wear failings, amplified, in my case, by the sight of too many price tags still swinging from the labels of so-called bargain sale items. Eventually, I started the selling process with a never worn Self Portrait evening dress &#8211; a bit of a Disney princess number with multiple layers and lashings of sequins; so not exactly quarantine comfort-wear.</p>

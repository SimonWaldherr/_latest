  Apple just unveiled its first 5G-enabled iPhones. Here's what 5G is, how you can get it, and how fast it is. 
description: > 
  As an evolution of something that already exists, 5G is set to be better than 4G LTE.It promises incredibly fast wireless communication for mobile devices, and the ability to handle heavier loads of traffic.5G networks are expected to be at least 10 times faster than 4G LTE, according to the wireless industry trade group GSMA as CNN reported.Other estimates put 5G capability at being 100 times faster than what we have now, according to CNET.5G is fast enough that it could also become an alternative to cables for transmitting all sorts of data.

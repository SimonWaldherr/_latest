  Jack Wilshere takes to the park to keep up his fitness as he seeks to find a new club 
description: > 
  The transfer window may have closed but there are still gems to be signed up on free transfers including Jack Wilshere, who in a bid to prove his worth is keeping up his fitness by training in the park.The former England international was released at the start of October by West Ham United despite the midfielder still having a year to serve on his Â£100,000 contract.Wilshere endured an injury blighted two years at boyhood club West Ham where he only featured in 16 Premier League matches.'Although I am frustrated I was not able to fully showcase what I am capable of at West Ham, I remain convinced that I can still contribute at the very top of the game.Rangers were thought to be keen on Wilshere but Steven Gerrard's Scottish Premiership leaders are yet to make an approach.

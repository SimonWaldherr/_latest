<p></p><p>&#8220;We need everyone to invest in women&#8217;s sports and Ilana and I are proud to stand with the Angel City FC ownership group and help make history in Southern California,&#8221; said King, a trailblazing tennis player and activist who is also a part owner of the Dodgers. &#8220;Angel City&#8217;s mission to make an impact on and off the field and to provide an opportunity to some of the best professional female athletes in the world to play on a stage as powerful as Los Angeles sends a strong message to young girls in the community and beyond.&#8221;</p><p>The eight-year-old NWSL, which played with nine teams this year, is scheduled to add a franchise in Louisville, Ky., next season and in Sacramento sometime in the next two years. Angel City will become the league&#8217;s 12th team when it begins play in 2022.</p><p>Southern California hasn&#8217;t had a first-tier women&#8217;s soccer team since the Los Angeles Sol folded in 2010 after one season.

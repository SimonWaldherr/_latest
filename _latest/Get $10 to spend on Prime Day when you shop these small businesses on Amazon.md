Amazon Prime Day (well, days) is coming up on October 13 and 14, and many of us are already making our lists of what we’re going to shop from Amazon’s huge inventory — after all, it’s a great time to score a deal on a big investment purchase (TV? Mattress?) or knock a few items off the holiday shopping list. But you can start saving already: If you spend $10 with one of Amazon’s US-based small-business partners now through October 12, you’ll get a $10 credit to use on a Prime Day purchase.

Amazon has made it easy to find exactly what you want — and direct your dollars too — with small businesses organized by region (such as the Midwest and Southeast), type of business owner (like makers, Black-owned and woman-owned) and category of product (like jewelry, home and pets).

Read on for some of our best picks from the small-business offer below. And don’t forget, there are other ways to get that $10 Prime Day credit too: Just spend $10 or more in a single purchase via Amazon Books, Amazon 4-Star and Amazon Pop-Up, or spend $10 on Whole Foods products, which is extremely easy to do.

Iya Foods Premium Cassava Flour, 5-Pound Bag ($18.50; amazon.com)

Iya Foods was started with the belief that foods should be made with real ingredients that are actually good for you. Sounds simple, but in the age of big corporate food producers, it isn’t. North Aurora, Illinois-based Toyin Kolawole started Iya Foods when, as a mom, she was searching for healthier, more nourishing foods for her family. Look for products inspired by Kolawole’s heritage as a Nigerian American, including this gluten-free organic cassava flour sourced from same-day harvests, or these ground yellow habaneros picked by hand in West Africa for a spicy kick during the cold months.

Ghinny Water Bottle With Time Marker ($16.90; amazon.com)

These affirmation flash cards help quickly growing brains do their thing by reinforcing both the alphabet and little ones’ confidence and sense of self-worth. Each card connects a letter of the alphabet to an empowering affirmation statement: “K,” for example, is for knowledge, with the affirmation statement “My knowledge is my greatest power.”

Fort Boards ($99.98; amazon.com)

Designed for indoor or outdoor use, this open-ended building toy helps curious kids learn STEM and STEAM skills, tying in engineering with creativity, play and spatial reasoning. It comes with 44 boards and 46 connectors that cover more than 20 square feet of surface area.

From a fifth-generation Maine dairy farmer comes a cute and practical line of organic hand-printed textiles. Each flour-sack towel is screenprinted by hand with eco-friendly water-based ink, and best of all, they’re absorbent, lint-free and quick-drying. Plus, they’re beautiful enough that they can stay on display, making them a perfect pick-me-up for yourself or a cherished present for a friend.

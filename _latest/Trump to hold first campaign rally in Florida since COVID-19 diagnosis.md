President Trump on Monday evening will host his first campaign rally outside the White House since he tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this month.

The 7 p.m. rally, at an airport hangar in Sanford, Florida, comes on the same day that his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, began Senate confirmation hearings.

Trump criticized the senators throughout the day on Twitter, and later turned to his competitor Joe Biden, blasting him for apparently not being able to draw crowds at his campaign events and for other gaffes.

“Almost nobody showed up to the Sleepy Joe Biden “Rally” in Ohio. The reporting and polls are a Media Con Job – Fake News. We have far more support and enthusiasm than even in 2016. November 3rd. will be a great day for America!!!” he wrote in one tweet.

“Sleepy Joe Biden had a particularly bad day today. He couldn’t remember the name of Mitt Romney, said again he was running for the U.S. Senate, and forgot what State he was in,” he added in another.

The rally will be carried on TV and livestreamed by C-SPAN, with additional streams available through the Trump campaign and their related social media accounts.

Trump has been off the campaign trail since his bout with COVID-19 that landed him in a Maryland hospital for three days.

On Monday, the White House doctor said the president has tested negative for the virus “on consecutive days.”

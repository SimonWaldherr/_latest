<div><p>A debate question for Trump: Keep interrupting or let Biden talk? Trump said answering reporters' question is his way of preparing.</p><p id="_ap_link_election_Elections_">Following a widely panned performance at the first presidential debate of the 2020 <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/elections" id="_ap_link_election_Elections_" target="_blank">election</a>, President <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump" id="_ap_link_Donald Trump_DonaldTrump_" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> said this week he was doing little in the way of formal preparation for his second and final meeting, on Thursday, with his Democratic opponent, former Vice President <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/joe-biden" id="_ap_link_Joe Biden_JoeBiden_" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>.</p><p>"We do interviews with you," Trump told reporters in Arizona Monday, where he held two campaign rallies. "This is like -- I call this 'debate prep.' This is actually tougher than a debate, if you want to know the truth."</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads incontentTeads--story ad-slot"></p><p>Biden, meanwhile, spent much of the week <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-campaign-deploys-top-surrogates-candidate-preps/story?id=73720943" target="_blank">off the trail</a>, using several days in his home state of Delaware to get ready for Thursday's face-off. In an interview Wednesday, he said that, while he hoped the debate would be substantive, he was readying for a barrage of personal attacks from Trump like those the president leveled in their first matchup.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News, center, gesturing during the first presidential debate between President Donald Trump, left, and Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden, right, Sept. 29, 2020, in Cleveland." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>&#8220;I hope he's gonna come prepared to talk about what he's for," Biden <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/one-on-one-with-joe-biden/34431537" target="_blank">told Milwaukee ABC affiliate WISN</a>. "But my guess is, he's kinda signaling that it's all going to be about personal attacks."</p><p>Even some of the president's supporters criticized his constant interruptions at the first debate in Cleveland last month, and led organizers to announce that this time, they would mute the candidates' microphones during their opponents' initial two-minute responses.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Oct. 19, 2020." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>A number of the president's allies called on him to let Biden speak more.</p><p>"The upside of the muted mics is Joe Biden will be forced to speak more than 30 seconds, he will inevitably walk himself into a few disasters," White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Tuesday in <a href="https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6203171919001/#sp=show-clips" target="_blank">an interview with Fox Business</a>.</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads2 incontentTeads2--story ad-slot"></p><p><a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6203166378001#sp=show-clips" target="_blank">Speaking with</a> the "Fox &amp; Friends" morning show on Tuesday, Trump said he "may" change his strategy and interrupt less -- but sounded undecided on his approach.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: President Donald Trump participates in the first presidential debate against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University on Sept. 29, 2020 in Cleveland." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>"They said if you let him talk, he'll lose his chain of thought because he's gonzo," the president said, referring to Biden. "And I understand that.

<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In two weeks, the most consequential election of our generation will come, and your time for choosing will arrive. As Republicans, will you stand with President Trump, or will you stand with, and stand up for, America? Will you protect democracy or protect a single person and his family?</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">We&#8217;re not merely talking about your vote.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">We&#8217;re talking about what comes next.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Never before in U.S. history has an incumbent president refused in advance to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-trump-refuses-to-say-hell-accept-election-results-republicans-press-to-make-voting-harder/2020/10/10/7cdd69be-0b08-11eb-859b-f9c27abe638d_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9" target="_blank">accept the outcome</a> of an election. In the days ahead, your party may call upon you to support efforts by a White House that refuses to transfer power after a loss at the polls. The weapons won&#8217;t be tanks but thousands of lawyers backed by an attorney general who works for the president, not the people.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">This effort will succeed only if a Republican Party power structure offers blind allegiance to one man instead of the republic. Every Republican elected official, staffer, consultant, operative and sympathizer will face a choice: my party or my country?</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">To do nothing is a choice. Passivity may seem easy at first. Soon, though, what you&#8217;ll be asked to do to remain in favor will surpass your moral boundaries. By then, it will be too late.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">And, by then, it will be anything but easy. Remember why you came to Washington. You came to serve, whether as an intern, young staffer or the most senior official in a government, with great hope and idealism. With time, all passions cool, but we hope that you have not, at your core, lost the beliefs that first brought you to the nation&#8217;s capital.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump, though, was never in anyone&#8217;s plan. From the moment he descended the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/watch-donald-trumps-grand-escalator-entrance-presidential-announcement-31802261" target="_blank">golden escalator</a>, you&#8217;ve seen him for what he is: a boor, incapable and unfit for office. His victory was an unwelcome shock. The Washington &#8212; the nation &#8212; you knew would soon be gone &#8212; none of us knew just how far gone.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Since taking office, Trump&#8217;s behavior has deteriorated. His contempt for the laws, traditions, rules and norms became breathtakingly evident. Hushed conversations over lunches and dinners became recitations of his latest outrage.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">But what did you do about it? Nothing.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">You know what Republican elected officials have said about Trump behind closed doors from the start because you are often &#8212; maybe always &#8212; behind those doors. You&#8217;ve seen the haunted look in a colleague&#8217;s or a boss&#8217;s eyes after a meeting with the unstable, unfit man who is our president. You know in your heart that Trump should not be president for another day.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">We understand what we are asking: to choose between doing what&#8217;s best for the country and doing what&#8217;s best for your bank account. Many of you have &#8220;kept your powder dry,&#8221; waiting for the right moment to say or do <i>something</i> &#8212; preserving all the while the little transactional encounters that can mean the difference between failure and success.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">We know what you stand to lose from taking a stand. Your phone calls and texts may go unreturned. The receptions, parties and dates on the social calendar may be outside your reach. You may be ostracized. You may lose business.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">And it will be worth it.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">To believe that your life or your business will continue as you&#8217;ve known them during four more years of the current administration is to close your eyes. You know what Trump is doing to the country you love.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">As conservatives, we long argued that culture was the soul of America. We were right, but it is Trump who now assaults our nation&#8217;s soul.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The time for choosing is at hand. Will you choose a republic or an autocracy?</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Some of you have chosen. You are already at work on this lawless and amoral project, litigating in the states to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/20/how-early-voting-deters-gop-voter-suppression/?itid=lk_inline_manual_31" target="_blank">suppress the vote</a>. Many of you are planning to replace slates of electors to win another term for Trump. Many of you are planning to snatch an election victory from the people by any means necessary.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Think hard before you continue.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump is collapsing. His campaign is leaderless and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-campaign-fundraising.html" target="_blank">broke</a>. His failures have cost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=lk_inline_manual_34" target="_blank">nearly 220,000</a> Americans their lives and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/business/economy/coronavirus-permanent-job-losses.html" target="_blank">tens of millions</a> their jobs. His instability is increasing; you see it every day.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Endangered members of the Senate are running from him as they finally realize that Trump will be their undoing. What are you waiting for?</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">None of us can choose history. History chooses us. If you ever wondered what side of the Edmund Pettus Bridge you would have stood on, this is your chance to choose. Those who went before faced dogs and fire hoses, and yet they did not flinch.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In war and peace, Americans have displayed unparalleled courage in the face of evil and injustice. It doesn&#8217;t take courage to stand up to Trump; it takes courage to stand up for your country. That is the legacy we inherited and are called to defend.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">That is the choice. America or Trump? Now is the time to stand with the country you love.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><i>Correction: This file was originally published with the incorrect name of a writer because of an editing error.</i></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><b>Read more:</b></p></div>

President Trump on Wednesday slammed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden following The Post’s bombshell exposé on Hunter Biden’s alleged hard drive and emails linking Joe Biden to his son’s job at a Ukrainian energy company.

“Vice President Biden, you owe the people of America an apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician,” Trump told a rally crowd in Des Moines, Iowa. “The Biden family treated the vice presidency as a for-profit corporation flying around the globe, collecting millions of dollars from China and Ukraine and Russia and other countries.

Trump said that the reporting indicates, “Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings.”

“These emails show that Biden’s repeated claim that he has never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings were a complete lie,” Trump said. “He’s trying to cover up a massive pay for play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency.”

“Hunter was being paid for access to his vice-president father, who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia,” Trump said.

Trump slammed Twitter for locking down White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s account and said social networks are taking down negative stories about Biden “almost before they even go up, they’re trying to protect them.”

From Air Force One before the rally, Trump tweeted he wanted to replace the companies’ protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act for operating as publishers rather than neutral hosts of third-party content.

Trump told rallygoers, “Now we can see clearly that Biden is a corrupt politician, you shouldn’t even be allowed to run for the presidency.”

In addition to locking down accounts, Twitter blocked users from sharing The Post’s link to the story, which describes an alleged 2015 email from Burisma energy executive Vadym Pozharskyi thanking Hunter Biden for “giving an opportunity to meet your father.”

Biden, who led the Obama administration Ukraine policy, said last year, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” including his reported $83,000 monthly pay on Burisma’s board.

Twitter said Wednesday it prevented users from tweeting or direct-messaging a link to the article because it violated a ban on distributing hacked material.

The contents of the hard drive allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden were passed on to The Post by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney to Trump, after he received it from a Delaware computer repairman.

The repairman says he legally accessed the content under an abandonment contract clause when Hunter Biden did not collect a damaged laptop within 90 days. He also turned over the laptop to the FBI.

Facebook, meanwhile, said it was taking unspecified steps to limit distribution of The Post’s article pending “fact-checking.”

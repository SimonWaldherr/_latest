A two-week circuit-breaker in December could save thousands of lives in the short-term and allow the UK breathing space to control the Covid-19 epidemic, Government advisers have said.

Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it may be too late to implement a two-week circuit-breaker over the October school half-term but December could be an option.

He and Matt Keeling, who advises the Government and is a professor of maths at the University of Warwick, said that a short, sharp lockdown would enable Test and Trace to improve as well as ensuring NHS hospitals do not become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients.

Prof Medley said there was "mixed evidence" that the current three-tier system would work, including a "danger" that places in Tier 3 may not be able to step back down to Tier 2 if measures were not strong enough.

He said any circuit-breaker should ideally be timed with school holidays to minimise disruption to education.

"So, half-term or potentially over Christmas," he said.

"You could even potentially add a week to the Christmas school holidays and potentially get some kind of three-week break, but the whole point is to reduce the prevalence before you actually have to do it.

"The reason that the lockdown (in March) worked, is because it separated households. And that's essentially what we've got to do is to make sure that the transmission doesn't go from household to household, and two weeks is the minimum time."

Prof Medley said thousands of deaths could be prevented up to January with a circuit-breaker but it was accurate to say that did not necessarily translate into lives saved in the long term.

The modelling paper written by Prof Medley and colleagues sets out that deaths could possibly reduce for the rest of the year from about 19,900 to 12,100. Hospital admissions could be reduced from 132,400 to 66,500.

<div><p>Kevin Cash was well aware his best player during the...</p><p>An aerial view of 30 Spaeth Lane in East Hampton, which is on the market for $67 million.</p><p>Throngs of wealthy New Yorkers who fled the city for the Hamptons during the COVID-19 lockdown and violent protests have <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/04/new-yorkers-scramble-to-rent-posh-winter-houses-ahead-of-second-wave/">decided to stay out East</a> &#8212; and are fueling a massive real estate boom.</p>
<p>In just three short months &#8212; from July to September &#8212; almost 1 billion dollars worth of property was snapped up in the Hamptons, according to a new market report by Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p>There were 448 single family home sales in the Hamptons during the third quarter of 2020, which is up 51% from the same time last year, according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The March mentality was to flee the city but now people want to stay. It&#8217;s a lifestyle choice. The pace is slower, there&#8217;s more space and it&#8217;s safe,&#8221; said broker Jennifer Friedberg, of Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">One of her clients, a couple with one child who live in Tribeca, moved into a Hamptons rental in March. On Friday they closed on a $4.3 million, 10,000-square-foot home of their own that will be their primary residence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;They love the space and now joke that they&#160;should have another baby,&#8221; Friedberg said. &#8220;The designers, decorators, architects and landscapers are all busy. These aren&#8217;t just weekend homes anymore. The homes have offices and study spaces for kids. People&#8217;s needs have changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dolly Lenz, of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, says many of the New Yorkers fleeing the city for the Hamptons had never even visited the East End before COVID-19 lockdown began.</p>
<p>One of her clients is a hedgefunder who is married with four kids. They moved from the Upper West Side into a $500,000 Hamptons rental in June.</p>
<p>They had never been to the Hamptons before. Now they are looking to buy a house of their dreams, Lenz said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a family of liberal Democrats who live in a beautiful apartment on the Upper West Side. But they <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/08/nyc-moms-fleeing-upper-west-side-amid-crime-and-chaos/">no longer felt safe</a>,&#8221; Lens said. &#8220;They took stock of their lives and realized they needed a place to go if something goes wrong &#8212; a safe haven.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $500,000 rental is &#8220;nice, but not amazing,&#8221; Lenz said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wanted to rent first. Now they are looking to buy. They never thought they&#8217;d need a place to run, but they are fleeing for safety,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They realize that even though they didn&#8217;t know the place, they know the people. Their friends are all here and they can do business here. It&#8217;s an extension of their life in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sales hit a staggering $973 million for the third quarter of this year, up from $483 million during the third quarter of 2019, according to the Brown Harris Stevens report.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a feverish 101.5 % surge over the third quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s no sign of any slowdown, even with the election looming, top brokers tell The Post.</p>
<p>For the first three quarters combined, Hamptons home sales hit $3.25 billion &#8212; a 40% jump from $2.31 billion in home sales during the same time last year, said Philip O&#8217;Connell, BHS managing director in the Hamptons.</p>

 
	<p>Sales surged as the coronavirus lockdown ended, in part because home buyers were once again allowed access to tour homes for sale, O&#8217;Connell told the Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pace was frenetic once we moved into late spring, early summer, but I wasn&#8217;t expecting to see the volume double. It&#8217;s striking,&#8221; O&#8217;Connell said. &#8220;Once the COVID regulations started to ease off and people could get into homes and have showings one at a time, with masks and gloves, it just took off. There was so much pent-up demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pandemic &#8220;was a rude awakening,&#8221; for many New Yorkers, says top broker Jenny Lenz, of Dolly Lenz Real Estate.</p>
<p>&#8220;These buyers are New Yorkers who love the city and they are staying &#8212; but they want a place to run away to,&#8221; Jenny Lenz said.</p>
<p>Sales prices in the Hamptons averaged $2.17 million during the third quarter, which is up 33.2% from the same time last year. The median price jumped 26.2% to $1.26 million, according to the report.</p>
<p>The most expensive Hamptons home sale of the year so far was in Southampton, where designer Calvin Klein quietly sold his oceanfront estate, at 650 Meadow Lane, for $84 million in an off market deal that closed in early March, pre-lockdown.</p>
<p>The rumored buyer is Ken Griffin, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/10/why-billionaire-ken-griffin-has-been-on-a-real-estate-spending-spree/">who bought</a> America&#8217;s most expensive condo at 220 Central Park South, and has been on a global buying spree.</p>
<p>Griffin did not return calls for comment at press time.</p>
<p>Another East Hampton <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/17/lavish-beachfront-compound-in-east-hampton-in-contract-for-70m/">waterfront compound</a> at 12-15 W Dune Lane is currently in contract for $70 million.</p>

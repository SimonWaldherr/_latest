<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more.</p><p>President Trump on Tuesday called for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop that reveals his <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">overseas business dealings</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We gotta get the attorney general to act and he&#8217;s gotta act and he&#8217;s gotta act fast,&#8221; the president said in a call to &#8220;Fox and Friends&#8221; Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gotta appoint somebody. This is major corruption and this has to be known about before the election.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Post reported last week that emails from a laptop belonging to Hunter &#8212; former Vice President Joe Biden&#8217;s son &#8212; showed he <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">leveraged his connections</a> to his father to Ukrainian business executives. The correspondence also showed one of those executives, Vadym Pozharskyi, thanking Hunter for &#8220;inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together [sic].&#8221;</p>
<p>On Fox, Trump also accused Joe Biden of getting kickbacks from his son&#8217;s business deals.</p>
<p>He appeared to be <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/">referring to The Post report</a> on one email sent to Hunter Biden on May 13, 2017, with the subject line &#8220;Expectations,&#8221; which included details of &#8220;remuneration packages&#8221; for six people involved in an unspecified business venture. By that time, Joe Biden was out of office.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was identified as &#8220;Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC,&#8221; an apparent reference to the former Shanghai-based conglomerate CEFC China Energy Co.</p>
<p>His pay was pegged at &#8220;850&#8221; and the email also noted that &#8220;Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the email outlined a &#8220;provisional agreement&#8221; under which 80 percent of the &#8220;equity,&#8221; or shares in the new company, would be split equally among four people whose initials correspond to the sender and three recipients, with &#8220;H&#8221; apparently referring to Biden.</p>
<p>The deal also listed &#8220;10 Jim&#8221; and &#8220;10 held by H for the big guy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Jim nor the &#8220;big guy&#8221; was identified further.</p>
<p>Fox News <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/hunter-biden-email-detailing-chinese-ties-confirmed-by-source-report/">later confirmed</a> the &#8220;big guy&#8221; was a reference to Joe Biden.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;The vice president got a kickback and everybody knows it and they&#8217;ve known it for a long time,&#8221; Trump said.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign has said it&#8217;s reviewed the Democratic presidential candidate&#8217;s schedule from the time and no meeting was noted to have taken place.</p>

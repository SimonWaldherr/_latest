<div><p>&#8220;One of the most inspiring things about this year has been to see so many young Americans fired up, organising, marching and fighting for change,&#8221; Mr Obama said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your generation can be the one that creates a new normal in America. One that&#8217;s fairer, where the system treats everybody equally and gives everybody opportunity. We can come out of this moment stronger than before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 44th president has made a few eye-catching contributions in the race so far on behalf of Joe Biden, who served as Mr Obama&#8217;s vice president and is now the Democratic presidential nominee.&#160;</p>
<p>At the Democratic convention in August, Mr Obama delivered a cutting keynote speech likening Donald Trump&#8217;s presidency to a &#8220;reality show&#8221; and praising his former deputy.</p>
<p>But with the Covid-19 pandemic limiting in-person events and Mr Trump again trying to pin his presidential rival as a stooge of the Washington establishment Mr Obama has not played a central role in Mr Biden&#8217;s campaign.</p>
<p>The former president&#8217;s contributions have largely been focussed on attempting to drive up turnout, especially among young voters.</p>
<p>He has repeatedly argued that, however disillusioned Americans are with the state of modern politics, the only way to affect real change is through the ballot box.</p>

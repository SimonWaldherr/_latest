<div><p>ABU DHABI &#8211; Things are about to come full circle for the Gaethje family.</p>
<p>When he fights lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 254, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/justin-gaethje">Justin Gaethje</a> will secure his mother&#8217;s retirement. This comes after his parents&#8217; years of sacrifice, hard work and putting their children before themselves.</p>
<p>Both of Gaethje&#8217;s parents will be in attendance Saturday at Flash Forum after flying internationally &#8211; and business class &#8211; for the first time. Gaethje&#8217;s father recently retired after 37 years as a copper miner.</p>
<p>As soon as the opening bell rings, Gaethje (22-2 MMA, 5-2 UFC) will be guaranteed a paycheck &#8211; and in turn, his mother will be afforded the comfort of retirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this fight starts, if that bell rings at the beginning, then I will secure that she will retire after this fight,&#8221; Gaethje said. &#8220;She&#8217;s been there for 35 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reflecting on his journey to UFC title contention, Gaethje is indebted to his parents&#8217; financial support and selflessness. Gaethje attributes much of his success to the foundation they laid for him and his siblings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every piece of money they had went into me and my brother and my sister, giving me the opportunities,&#8221; Gaethje said. &#8220;We were two hours from any city. Going school-clothes shopping was a vacation for us. We&#8217;d get up and go to wrestling tournaments. We had to drive two to three hours. Sometimes, we&#8217;d have to stay the night. They financially took hits every single time we did that. Nothing is better than being able to repay that.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>While their presence is sentimental in nature, Gaethje won&#8217;t be thinking about his parents when the cage door closes. The only outside voice he&#8217;ll hear is his coach, Trevor Wittman, as he tries to do something 28 other fighters have failed at: handing Nurmagomedov (28-0 MMA, 12-0 UFC) his first loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;For them to be here, when I step in that octagon, nothing matters,&#8221; Gaethje said. &#8220;They&#8217;re not there. My coach, Trevor Wittman, is there. That&#8217;s the only voice that I can hear. That&#8217;s all that matters to me, but I&#8217;m very happy that they get to experience this.&#8221;</p>
<p>UFC 254 takes place Saturday at Flash Forum. The main card streams on pay-per-view after prelims on ESPN 2/ESPN+.</p>

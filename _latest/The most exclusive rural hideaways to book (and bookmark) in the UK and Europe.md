It also comes with a cinema, indoor pool, hot tub and an underground party room with a bar. Should you desire, they'll prepare you six-course tasting menus, deliver luxury hampers or arrange a 'fire feast' by the lake: with flame-grilled local produce served on shared platters.

Dun Aluinn, Scottish Highlands

It's clear that the new owners of what was formerly known as Tay House, now Dun Aluinn - an old Victorian school boarding house set in five-and-a-half acres just outside Aberfeldy - had great fun doing it up. It probably helped that one of them, Susie Whyte, spent many years as an architect and interior designer in New York and San Francisco.

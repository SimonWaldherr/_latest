White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany expressed optimism that Trump will be cleared to resume public activities on Saturday but said he will not make appearances if he can transmit the virus.

McEnany also said it could be logistically “tough” to hold the campaign rally that Trump wants to stage Saturday in Florida.

Appearing on Fox News, McEnany said that White House officials are hopeful that a prediction in a memo on Thursday by Trump’s physician, Sean P. Conley, will hold. Conley wrote that Trump could safely “return to public engagements” on Saturday, based on the date on which he tested positive for the coronavirus and his response to treatments.

McEnany declined to say what specific medical tests Trump would have to clear to resume activities, saying she would leave that to Conley.

“Rest assured, we will make sure that he’s in a good spot before he’s out there,” McEnany said. “He won’t be out there if he can transit the virus.”

In a television interview Thursday night, Trump said he would like to hold a rally Saturday night in Florida and then one in Pennsylvania, two states crucial to his reelection.

<div><p>The Dutch king and queen cut short a holiday in Greece on Saturday after facing criticism for taking a vacation when the Netherlands is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/netherlands/amsterdam/articles/amsterdam-postcard-coronavirus-partial-lockdown/">under a partial coronavirus lockdown</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/17/dutch-king-reveals-secret-life-commercial-co-pilot/">King Willem-Alexander</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/royals/exuberant-joyful-queen-maxima-netherlands-worlds-glamorous-royal/">Queen Maxima</a> said they had taken on board the "intense" public reaction when news emerged of their holiday and returned after just one day.</p>
<p>"We will abort our vacation. We see people's reactions to media reports, and they are intense, and they affect us," the king and queen said in a statement late on&#160;Friday.</p>
<p>"We do not want to leave any doubts about it: in order to get the Covid-19 virus under control, it is necessary that the guidelines are followed. The debate over our holiday does not contribute to that."</p>
<p>The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in the Netherlands has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/11/netherlands-records-second-highest-case-increase-europe-despite/">more than doubled over the past two weeks</a>, to 42 cases per 100,000 people on Friday.</p>
<p>Dutch bars and restaurants were closed as of Wednesday as part of a partial lockdown that will last at least four weeks, and&#160;&#160;people are being urged to stay at home as much as possible.</p>
<p>Ministers were caught unaware when news of the royal holiday broke, leading to public broadcaster NOS saying Prime Minister Mark Rutte had "little control" over the king.</p>
<p>It comes as King Willem-Alexander faces growing criticism for being out of touch, with Mr Rutte recently ordering a review of the annual budget for the royal family, under pressure from opposition lawmakers.</p>

Cold callers are targeting elderly people in an attempt to pressure them into buying bogus or unnecessary cover for household appliances in what has been described as a “wild west”.

Some victims have been tricked into paying more than £1,000 to firms, a number of which masqueraded as well-known brands.

Consumer group Which? received 150 complaints about potentially scam calls from companies offering cover for washing machines and other appliances between July 2019 and July 2020.

Of the 62 companies that were reported, only two were regulated – even though this is a requirement for firms offering insurance. Others described what they were selling as “service plans”, although some referred to it as insurance over the phone.

A number of the companies seemed to be working together to target vulnerable people, Which? said. Some operated under different names but were run by the same people.

In one case, a woman found that her recently deceased father-in-law had been paying 28 direct debits for appliance cover, totalling more than £1,000 per month.

He had four policies with one firm. One of these was for £516 to cover a fridge-freezer from March 2018 to 2021, yet he was also paying another firm, Protect Your Bubble Ltd, to cover the same appliance over part of the same period.

The company has no link to the insurer Protect Your Bubble, which is part of Assurant Direct Ltd, a regulated firm. The Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, put out a warning against Protect Your Bubble Ltd, calling it a clone company used by fraudsters.

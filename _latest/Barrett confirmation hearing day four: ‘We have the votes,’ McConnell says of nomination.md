Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) made an impassioned appeal to Republicans to halt Barrett’s nomination process in the name of saving the institutional integrity of Congress, appealing to them to commit “an act of heroism” by delaying her confirmation until after Election Day.

“The greatest acts of American history are when people have the authority to do something, but they showed the restraint of power and did not use the authority,” Booker said. “This is one of those moments, where that is the kind of grace that can stop this tumbling of this institution further toward what I think will be a real constitutional crisis.”

The timing of Barrett’s confirmation process has been a key dispute between Democrats, who insist that it is wrong to be putting a new justice on the Supreme Court while the 2020 voting season is already underway, and Republicans, who argue that while Donald Trump is still president, he can appoint whom he wants.

Democrats have accused Republicans of being hypocrites, because of their refusal in 2016 to consider then-President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland. But they have also acknowledged that Barrett’s confirmation “is pretty much cooked,” as Booker put it Thursday.

Still, he warned, there were “troubling” aspects of the process that would contribute to the “erosion of precedent” in the committee, for future Supreme Court fights. In particular, he pointed out that Barrett had “refused to answer” a lot of questions he considered to be “in bounds” — including whether she supported the peaceful transfer of power between presidents.

“We do have common virtue, we do have common values, we have common cause,” Booker said, adding that the “tit for tat” of partisan politics was something lawmakers could try to change. “But we are doing this and failing as a body to lead in a time of crisis.”

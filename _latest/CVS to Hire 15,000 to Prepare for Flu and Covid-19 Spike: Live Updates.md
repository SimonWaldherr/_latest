It&#8217;ll be a chance to see how corporate bottom lines have been affected by the still uncontrolled pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Analysts are predicting that the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report a decline in profits of about 20 percent for the three months through September, compared with the same period last year. That would be ugly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But it would be an improvement compared with the 32 percent tumble profits took during the second quarter, which was one of the worst quarters for earnings since 2009, when the U.S. was suffering the worst of a deep recession.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The numbers in earnings reports are always an estimation game on Wall Street, with results graded on a curve compared with the expectations that investors and analysts hold.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">So when expectations are deeply negative, a not-as-bad result can fuel stock market gains. In the last reporting season, which got underway in July, a record number of companies did better than expected. That lifted the stock market to a high, even as a fresh coronavirus wave was slamming the economy.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The S&amp;P 500 rose 5.5 percent in July and 7 percent in August, hitting its highest point in early September.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A similar less-bad-is-good dynamic could be in store for investors over the next few weeks. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/business/bank-earnings-wall-street-coronavirus.html" title="">Wall Street banks reported</a> their results last week, and they were much better than expected. (On the other hand, the airlines Delta and United posted disappointing numbers, even when factoring in the already diminished expectations because of Covid-19.)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">This week, the pace of reporting will pick up, with companies like IBM, Netflix, Procter &amp; Gamble, Verizon, AT&amp;T and Intel scheduled to release results. Analysts will scour that news for clues about economically important issues, such as whether further cost-cutting plans are coming down the pike, potentially weighing on economic growth.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Right now the predictions are that companies in industries that are sensitive to short-term economic swings, including industrial equipment companies and airlines, will produce the worst results over the next few weeks. While those in industries such as health care, consumer staples and technology &#8212; relatively insulated from the vicissitudes of the Covid economy &#8212; will fare better.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Either way, don&#8217;t expect corporate chiefs to be too chatty about the outlook for the future, given the scale of the uncertainty stretching into the future.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Most managements will still be reluctant to provide forward earnings guidance,&#8221; wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a preview of the next few weeks of results. &#8220;The uncertain timeline of a vaccine that is essential for the normalization of the economy, the stalled talks between the Trump administration and Congress on an interim fiscal package, and the contentious election that is only 25 days away are all valid reasons for executives to minimize forward-looking commentary.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matt-phillips" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="the-fed-is-still-thinking-about-whether-it-should-issue-a-digital-currency"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#the-fed-is-still-thinking-about-whether-it-should-issue-a-digital-currency">The Fed is still thinking about whether it should issue a digital currency.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="&#8220;The dollar is the world&#8217;s principal reserve currency,&#8221; Mr. Powell said." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/business/19markets-brf-powell/merlin_178244139_d0ee765b-1854-49b6-8c89-4c4921ecb6ce-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">&#8220;The dollar is the world&#8217;s principal reserve currency,&#8221; Mr. Powell said.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Joshua Roberts/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Jerome H.

The robust performance brings China almost back up to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html" title="">roughly 6 percent pace of growth</a> that it was reporting before the pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Many of the world&#8217;s major economies have climbed quickly out of the depths of a contraction last spring, when shutdowns caused output to fall steeply. But China is the first to report growth that significantly surpasses where it was at this time last year. The United States and other nations are expected to report a third-quarter surge too, but they are still behind or just catching up to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">China&#8217;s lead could widen further in the months to come. It has almost no local transmission of the virus now, while the United States and Europe face another accelerating wave of cases.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The vigorous expansion of the Chinese economy means that it is set to dominate global growth &#8212; accounting for at least 30 percent of the world&#8217;s economic growth this year and in the years to come, Justin Lin Yifu, a cabinet adviser and honorary dean of the National School of Development at Peking University, said at a recent government news conference in Beijing.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">China&#8217;s economic growth in the past three months came in slightly below economists&#8217; forecasts of 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent. But the performance was still strong enough that stock markets in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong rose in early trading on Monday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The country&#8217;s broadening recovery could also be seen in economic statistics just for September, which were also released on Monday.

Coming days after the completion of Chevron&#8217;s takeover of Noble Energy, the acquisition appeared to signal an accelerating industry consolidation as companies seek to cut expenses with oil prices languishing around $40 a barrel, just above the levels many businesses need to break even.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Concho is little known outside of Texas but it has some of the most productive fields in the Permian Basin, which straddles West Texas and New Mexico. The company became a major oil producer following its 2018 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/business/energy-environment/texas-oil-deal.html" title="">purchase of RSP Permian for $9.5 billion</a>. Concho produced more than 300,000 barrels in the second quarter.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This is not just another industry deal,&#8221; Ryan M. Lance, ConocoPhillips&#8217;s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s an affirmation of our joint commitment to lead a structural change for our vital industry sector.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">ConocoPhillips has operations across the world and has been especially active in Alaska in recent years. But it has been a relatively small shale player.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">American oil companies have been laying off tens of thousands of workers in recent months and their share prices have tumbled, some by more than 50 percent. Some distressed oil companies have been forced to seek bankruptcy protection. But ConocoPhillips is in relatively good shape and has a strong balance sheet. The company recently resumed buying back its own stock.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tim Leach, Concho&#8217;s chief executive, said the transaction would form a company &#8220;that can deliver superior returns through cycles.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/clifford-krauss" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="heres-the-business-news-to-watch-in-the-week-ahead"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#heres-the-business-news-to-watch-in-the-week-ahead">Here&#8217;s the business news to watch in the week ahead.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#128483; It&#8217;s a big week for corporate earnings, with a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 reporting results.

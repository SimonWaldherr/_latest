As the Los Angeles Lakers took the bus back to the hotel early Monday morning after celebrating their 2020 NBA championship, they forgot one piece of precious cargo: Quinn Cook.

The Lakers guard had to enter JR Smith's Instagram Live to alert the team he was left at the arena by himself.

Honestly, if you're going to get Home Alone'd, there are a lot worse places than a basketball arena filled with beer and champagne after you just reached the pinnacle of your sport. If I were Cook, I would be walking around the arena like Will Smith in the Fresh Prince of Bel Air finale, reminiscing over the last few months and turning off every last light fixture of the bubble.

That said, Cook probably just wanted to go back to the hotel and crash before hopping a flight to see his family.

Understandable.

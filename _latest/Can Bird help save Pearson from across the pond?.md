<div><p>By running Pearson from the US, Bird will be eschewing an office with one of the best views in London, overlooking the Thames.</p>
<p>It is all pretty odd, not least since Pearson has spent the past several years assuring everyone that its struggles in the US should not be overstated. The American market was of declining importance to its global education business, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/18/pearson-boss-john-fallon-step-six-years/">outgoing boss John Fallon</a> would argue, with the backing of the same board that has decided Bird should run things from the US.</p>
<p>Pearson shareholders, apparently roused from their long slumber by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/18/activist-investor-cevian-ups-stake-pearson-publisher-attempts/">the arrival on the register of the activist Cevian</a>, are now in something close to open revolt.</p>
<p>As well as Bird&#8217;s living arrangements, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/09/18/pearson-hit-shareholder-rebellion-new-chiefs-share-deal/">his pay package has sparked anger</a>. Within little over three years he is in line for three payouts totalling $9.4m, which in the eyes of shareholders are tied to financial performance nowhere near tightly enough.</p>
<p>Some of them voted through Bird&#8217;s package against their own better judgment. Though a third rebelled, most were desperate for new leadership after a belated and lengthy search by US/Brazil-based chairman Sidney Taurel, who was assisted in the end by the City headhunter Jan Hall.</p>
<p>Either Bird had to be approved or it was back to the drawing board with another six months to a year of drift, they decided.</p>
<p>Their frustration is compounded by the fact that Bird was already on the Pearson board as a non-executive and was allowed to interview other candidates before taking the role.</p>
<p>It all means that from day one the new boss is under extreme pressure to come up with a strategy to overturn years of disappointment that included an extraordinary run of seven profit warnings in seven years. He perhaps has 100 days to make an impression on Pearson and placate shareholders.</p>

Dear A&E,

I’m bored. I’ve got a good career, good home, good marriage, and three good kids. But something is off. I thought I’d escaped midlife-crisis territory (I’m 65), but I’m underwhelmed by everything: holidays, books, conversations, life… To my wife’s amusement, I’ve joined a squash club, invested in buy-to-let properties, but nothing helps. The idea of a PhD (one friend’s suggestion) bores me. And please don’t suggest a cruise or writing my memoir. I’m not depressed, just unstimulated, and I’m counting down to a retirement I’m not sure how to fill.— Bored

Dear Bored,

Well this is a knotty problem, not least because you don’t sound bored. You sound frustrated and shut down and cornered. Boredom, in our experience, is often indicative of more than the sum of its parts. Yes, it could be sheer ennui about the same-sameness of life. But it is also an easy refuge for the scared and the shy. A ‘boring party’ verdict might mean that every single person there was dull, but it might also mean that the bored partygoer was unwilling or unable to seek out the treasure in the room. Because that is what a fulfilling life is about: a quest for what fills us with light. Not an acceptance of circumstance; however privileged.

It sounds as though you have been lucky enough to be trapped in a successful corporate situation for some time. Comfortable. Unchallenged. Uninspired. But with the cash to flirt with the clichéd crisis tropes of fast cars (in your longer letter, abridged here, you mention buying an Aston Martin) and ghastly clubs.

So you’re stuck in a kind of bored echo chamber and there is a flavour of judgement, but also of self-loathing about your letter that feels uncomfortable to us and must feel much more uncomfortable to you.

First of all, how do you know you’re not depressed? How can you be so sure? Depression takes many forms. You don’t have to be lying in bed with the curtains drawn for many months to prove that your mental health is not what it could be. How’s your sex drive? How’s your appetite? Can you roar with laughter? Take pleasure in your children? If not then why not? Possibly because you need a bit of professional help. What does your wife think? Have you had an honest conversation along the lines of, ‘Do I seem OK to you?’ Because you don’t sound OK to us.

And what with your general floppiness, we wondered if you might be experiencing andropausal (that’s the male menopause, people) symptoms or possibly low testosterone, which can be extremely flattening. So we asked the hormone expert (who many people call the magician because he is so brilliant) Dr Martin Galy. He suggests ‘a medical examination to explore the other symptoms associated with andropause – weight gain, low mood, sweats and, of course, lowered libido. You should also have your testosterone checked.’

But, Bored, we suspect you may not be the kind of man to follow that path. You may find the prospect boring. So here’s some concrete advice: spend one-on-one time with your kids. They’re not just ‘good kids’, they’re miracles because they’re yours. Reconnect with that. Because it will feel real and you need to plug into what is real right now. Not squash and Barbados and sky-diving, but human beings.

Help someone. Help lots of people. Volunteer for one of the many amazing charities that are trying, against the odds, to help the increasing number of increasingly desperate people out there during the pandemic. Use your privilege and your wisdom and your spare time to make a difference to people who are struggling. Mentor young people facing a desolate job market. Use the Aston Martin to deliver food or care packages to vulnerable people. Be a hero. Be brave. Open your eyes.

In short, Bored, ask not what the world can do for you but what you can do for the world. Because it needs you. It needs all the help it can get. And it might just switch your light back on…

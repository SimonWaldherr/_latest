Joe Biden’s campaign on Thursday said they had no problem with Twitter and Facebook’s unprecedented censoring of The Post’s bombshell reporting on Hunter Biden’s business dealings — even admitting they were “glad” it happened.

Biden campaign National Press Secretary Jamal Brown went so far as to claim that the gagging of one of America’s largest newspapers “made clear” that The Post’s reporting on Ukraine- and China-related documents from a Hunter Biden hard drive were untrue.

“What is your campaign’s response to this article and do you think that Twitter is doing the right thing here?” a Cheddar anchor asked Brown of the forming political maelstrom.

“I think Twitter’s response to the actual article itself makes clear that these purported allegations are false and they’re not true and glad to see social media companies like Twitter taking responsibility to limit misinformation,” Brown said.

Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans on Thursday said they will hold a hearing next week to compel Twitter’s chief executive to testify and have invited Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to do the same.

The Post’ reporting included an email from Hunter Biden indicating he introduced his then-vice president father to an executive at Ukraine energy firm Burisma — despite the elder Biden saying he never discussed his troubled son’s “overseas business dealings” with him.

The Biden campaign has denied that the former vice president ever had such a meeting on his “official” schedule but has not denied he ever met with the man.

Another article published Thursday describes Hunter Biden’s alleged pursuit of a China business deal was also blocked.

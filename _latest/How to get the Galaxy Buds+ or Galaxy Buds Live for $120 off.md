Save $120: Get a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds+ for $29.99 or Galaxy Buds Live for $49.99 when you buy a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 (starting at $249.99) or a Galaxy Watch3 (starting $369.99 on sale) at Best Buy.

Scoping out bundle deals is one of the most genius methods for holiday shoppers on a budget. Whether both items go to two people or one goes to you as a reward for finding such a steal, it's saving money somewhere.

One bundle in the depths of Best Buy's Top Deals page is the move for fitness tracker seekers who have taken the Apple Watch out of the running: Purchasing some version of the Galaxy Watch Active2 (there are 16 to choose from!) or the new Galaxy Watch3 subsequently slashes $120 off the price of a pair of Galaxy Buds+ or Galaxy Buds Live, making them just $29.99 and $49.99, respectively. (Sale prices don't count when calculating the discount.)

Choose "build a bundle" instead of adding your selected watch to your cart. This takes you to the essential add-ons section, where you can choose your pair of Galaxy Buds under the "wireless headphones" tab. The discount will be applied automatically.

Both Samsung watches are tough Apple Watch competitors. The Active2 is more fitness focused while the Galaxy Watch3 is the clear smartwatch leader of the pack. Running Coach, a beloved distance running partner that gives audio cues through your headphones about form and pace, is present on both.

Physically, the Galaxy Watch3 is more of a watch-watch, made distinct from the Active2 with the physical knobs on the side, as well as its rotating bezel â€” a crowd favorite. With it, you can spin through menus for things like music, fitness metrics, weather, and phone notifications. Better sleep tracking (specifically duration of sleep and time spent awake) and tracking of the amount of oxygen you consume during your workout are on board to make it one of the best fitness partners you can buy. 40 different exercise modes help, too.

A year or so after its debut, a heart-monitoring electrocardiogram feature is finally available on the Galaxy Watch Active2. It's officially a cheaper way to get an ECG app on your wrist than the Fitbit Sense (the only Fitbit that does ECG), which retails for $329.95.

To choose between the Galaxy Buds+ or Galaxy Buds Live, one question settles it all: How much do you care about active noise cancellation?

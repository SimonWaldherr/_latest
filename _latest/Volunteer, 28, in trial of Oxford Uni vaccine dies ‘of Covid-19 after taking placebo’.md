 <p>     </p> <p>Brazil's health authority, Anvisa, was reportedly told of the death on Monday. It said testing would continue in the trial.</p> <p> Sources close to the trial said Dr Feitosa had not been given the vaccine, but a benign placebo, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12989017/astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-death-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Sun</a> reports. It remains unclear how he contracted the bug. </p> <p>Neither Anvisa nor AstraZeneca would comment on the specifics of the case, and Oxford University earlier said there were no concerns around the trial.</p> <p>Anvisa said in a statement: "In relation to the death of the Oxford vaccine testing volunteer, Anvisa was formally informed of this fact on October 19, 2020.</p> <p><strong>Are you taking part in a clinical trial?

 <p>     </p> <p>"Data related to the investigation carried out by the International Safety Assessment Committee was shared with the Agency.</p> <p>"It is important to highlight that, based on the ethical confidentiality commitments provided for in the protocol, the regulatory agencies involved receive partial data referring to the investigation carried out by this committee, which suggested that the study should continue, thus the process remains under evaluation.</p> <p>"Therefore, Anvisa reiterates that, according to national and international regulations of Good Clinical Practices, data on clinical research volunteers must be kept confidential, in accordance with the principles of confidentiality, human dignity and protection of participants.&#160;</p> <p>"Anvisa is committed to complying with these regulations, in order to ensure the privacy of volunteers and also the country's reliability for carrying out studies of such relevance."</p>

 <p>An AstraZeneca spokesperson similarly refused to comment on the case.</p> <p>They said: "We cannot comment on individual cases in an ongoing trial of the Oxford vaccine as we adhere strictly to medical confidentiality and clinical trial regulations, but we can confirm that all required review processes have been followed.</p> <p>"All significant medical events are carefully assessed by trial investigators, an independent safety monitoring committee and the regulatory authorities.</p> <p>"These assessments have not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study."</p> <p>Oxford University earlier said there are "no concerns" about the safety of the clinical trial.</p>

 <p>It said in a statement: "All significant medical incidents, whether participants are in the control group or the Covid-19 vaccine group, are independently reviewed.</p> <p>"Following careful assessment of this case in Brazil, there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial and the independent review in addition to the Brazilian regulator have recommended that the trial should continue."</p> <p>Reuters also reported that, according to local media, the volunteer had been given a placebo jab rather than the vaccine.</p> <p>The drug is one of the frontrunners as scientists across the world attempt to find a way out of the coronavirus nightmare gripping the planet.</p> <p>Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England&#8217;s deputy chief medical officer, has said the jab could be available around the turn of the year.</p> <p>It was paused last month after a participant became ill, but following a review was allowed to continue.</p> <img>

<p>In a statement at the time, AstraZeneca said: "In large clinical trials, illnesses will happen by chance and must be independently reviewed.</p> <p>"AstraZeneca is working to expedite the review of the single event to minimise any potential impact on the trial timetable.</p> <p>"We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standard of conduct in our trials."</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>Britain has stockpiled 340 million doses from six prototype vaccines - the most of any country - but taskforce boss Kate Bingham admits there are still plenty of uncertainties.</p> <p>The head of the UK Vaccine Taskforce said a "partially effective vaccine is better than no vaccine at all" and that any vaccine would likely require more than one dose.</p> <p> "Flu vaccines are 50% effective, but they are widely used and have a big impact on reducing the clinical impacts of flu in the population," Ms Bingham told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-first-vaccines-unlikely-to-end-pandemic-says-uk-vaccines-chief-12103362" rel="nofollow">Sky News.</a></p></div>

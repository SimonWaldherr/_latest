  ‘It's beautiful’: Trump says women like him because he improved dishwasher pressure 
description: > 
  Donald Trump has suggested that his administration’s actions on dishwasher pressure meant women supported him.And that, said the Republican candidate, was because he “freed up” dishwashers to dispense more water.Now you can buy a dishwasher, and it [the water] comes out.It's beautiful, go and buy a dishwasher,” he said to the crowd.Mr Trump complained last November that women told him about so-called broken dishwashers, and that he would move to amend regulations in a pitch to American voters.

North Dakota, which is leading the nation in coronavirus cases per capita, reported more than 1,000 cases on Tuesday, the state&#8217;s worst daily total yet. And as of Monday, 16 states had added more cases in the prior week than in any other seven-day stretch.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After weeks of spread and warnings in certain areas, a third surge of coronavirus infections has now firmly taken hold across much of the United States.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The latest wave &#8212; which is raging most acutely in the Midwest and West, but is also spreading in various areas around the country &#8212; threatens to be the worst of the pandemic yet.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Its arrival comes as cooler weather is forcing people indoors, setting up a grueling winter that will test the discipline of many Americans who have grown weary of wearing masks and turning down invitations to see family and friends. Over the past week, the country has averaged about 59,000 new cases a day, the most since the beginning of August. The daily total could soon surpass 75,687, a record previously set on July 16.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The high case count &#8212; which has so far not translated to soaring deaths &#8212; in part reflects increased testing. With about 1 million people tested on many days, the country is getting a far more accurate picture of how widely the virus has spread than it did in the spring.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the latest developments also reflect a serious new level of the outbreak. Hospitalizations, the most accurate picture of how many people are seriously sick from the virus, are on the rise nationwide, worrying many public health officials. And a rise in deaths tends to lag behind a spike in cases.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota, recently offered an ominous warning: with infections rising and compliance eroding, he said, &#8220;the next six to 12 weeks are going to be the darkest of the entire pandemic.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sarah-mervosh" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sarah Mervosh</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mitch-smith" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="cuomo-says-ny-wont-enforce-restrictions-on-three-neighbors-after-confusion-over-quarantine-for-pennsylvania-travelers"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#cuomo-says-ny-wont-enforce-restrictions-on-three-neighbors-after-confusion-over-quarantine-for-pennsylvania-travelers">Cuomo says N.Y. won&#8217;t enforce restrictions on three neighbors, after confusion over quarantine for Pennsylvania travelers.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Diners in Marlboro, N.J., in September.

Neither state, nor Pennsylvania, was on a quarantine list released on Tuesday afternoon by the governor&#8217;s office.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Mr. Cuomo said that all nonessential travel among New York and the three states should be avoided and promised he would issue more guidance on that point on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">All told, Mr. Cuomo said that more than 40 places now qualified for New York&#8217;s travel advisory list, something he referred to as &#8220;really a bizarre outcome.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Tuesday, more than 64,200 new cases and at least 517 new deaths <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">were reported in the United States</a>. Over the last week, there have been an average of 59,269 cases per day, an increase of 34 percent from the average two weeks earlier, and fears are growing in New York about a potential second wave. Two weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo closed nonessential businesses in parts of Queens and Brooklyn where positivity rates had spiked.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Since late June, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have worked in concert to create a list of states from which travelers to the region are subject to a two-week quarantine.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Essential workers</a> have been exempt from the quarantine since it began in June, and Mr. Cuomo did not announce changes to that policy. Other workers who cross state lines have technically been subject to the advisory, but officials have also said that the quarantine is only required by those who spend at least 24 hours in a state on the list &#8212; which would exclude most commuters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The quarantine was intended to apply to any person arriving from an area with a positivity rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents over a 7-day rolling average or an area with a 10 percent or higher positivity rate over a 7-day rolling average.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">New Jersey has a population of about 8.88 million people, and so anything over an average of about 888 new cases puts the state above that threshold. According to a New York Times database, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html#cases" title="">New Jersey has seen an average of 1,016 cases per day</a> in the last week, an increase of 54 percent from the average two weeks earlier.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For Connecticut, the threshold is around 356, and its daily average in the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/connecticut-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">last week was at 378 cases per day</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Though New York has seen a significant increase in cases in parts of New York City and its suburbs, its overall positivity rate has remained lower than its neighbors.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-mckinley" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Jesse McKinley</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-gold" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="pelosi-mnuchin-stimulus"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#pelosi-mnuchin-stimulus">McConnell advises White House not to strike pre-election stimulus deal with Pelosi.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Capitol on Sunday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/18/us/politics/18election-briefing-pelosi-sub/merlin_178697223_9bc20ff4-bcf4-4649-9190-1dbd31212a70-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Capitol on Sunday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has advised the White House not to strike a deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new stimulus bill before Election Day, he told Republican senators privately on Tuesday, cautioning against reaching an agreement that most in the party cannot accept.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell&#8217;s counsel, confirmed by three Republicans familiar with his remarks, threw cold water on Mr. Trump&#8217;s increasingly urgent push to enact a fresh round of pandemic aid before he faces voters on Nov. 3. It underscored the divisions within the party that have long hampered a compromise.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi had said earlier on Tuesday that she was &#8220;optimistic&#8221; a deal could be reached with the Trump administration in the coming days. But Republicans are growing increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump and his team are too eager to reach a multitrillion-dollar agreement and are conceding far too much to the Democrats. Republicans fear that scenario would force their colleagues up for re-election into a difficult choice of defying the president or alienating their fiscally conservative base by embracing the big-spending bill he has demanded.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Republicans in the Senate were also concerned that any vote on such a package could interfere with the Senate&#8217;s hasty timetable for confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court by early next week. Mr. McConnell said he told the White House he was particularly concerned a deal before then could inject unwanted unpredictability into the schedule, according to the Republicans, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a closed party luncheon.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell made it clear that he knew his counsel was likely to leak out, making reference to the possibility that his remarks could appear in the news media, two of the Republicans said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A short time later, outside the hearing room where Republicans met privately, Mr. McConnell told reporters the Senate would consider a broad bipartisan stimulus deal if the White House and Democrats struck one. But he would not say if it would hold a vote before Election Day, and members of his leadership team have warned that Republican votes could be hard to come by in the chamber.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If a presidentially supported bill clears the House, at some point we&#8217;ll bring it to the floor,&#8221; he said, without elaborating on the timetable.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, were scheduled to discuss the matter at 3 p.m. Tuesday. &#8220;Hopefully, by the end of the day today, we&#8217;ll know where we all are,&#8221; the speaker said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Sunday, Ms. Pelosi said that to pass a bill before the election, a deal would have to be reached within 48 hours. But in the interview on Tuesday, she softened that time limit, saying instead that legislation would have to be finished by the end of next week for aid to begin flowing by Nov. 3.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that this day was the day that we have a deal,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi said. &#8220;It was a day that we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell planned a test vote later Tuesday on a narrow measure that would revive the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular small-business loan program. While Democrats support the program, they are expected to oppose the narrow bill, contending that a far broader package is needed.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Nicholas Fandos</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-human-challenge-trial-will-begin-in-january-in-which-volunteers-are-deliberately-exposed-to-the-virus"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-human-challenge-trial-will-begin-in-january-in-which-volunteers-are-deliberately-exposed-to-the-virus">A human challenge trial will begin in January, in which volunteers are deliberately exposed to the virus.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A researcher in a laboratory at Imperial College London." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20virus-briefing-ImperialCollege/merlin_177880182_f9b69a2e-4c35-4b9d-9e13-2cc156e30055-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A researcher in a laboratory at Imperial College London.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Researchers at Imperial College London are planning to deliberately infect healthy volunteers with the coronavirus early next year as part of the world&#8217;s first effort to study how people immunized with different vaccines respond to controlled exposure to the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The study, known as a human challenge trial, is scheduled to begin in January at a quarantine facility in London with 34 million pounds, or $44 million, of British government funding, the government announced on Tuesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Such a study could save time in the race to winnow down a large number of vaccine candidates.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Rather than testing vaccines the usual way &#8212; by waiting for vaccinated people to encounter the virus in their homes and communities &#8212; researchers would expose them to the virus in a controlled setting.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the first stage of the study, scientists will try to determine the smallest doses of the virus required to infect people. The scientists will test gradually increasing doses of virus on up to 90 healthy volunteers from 18 to 30 years old until they reach a level that reliably infects them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Once they have decided on a dose &#8212; potentially by late spring, the government said &#8212; researchers will begin to compare a set of coronavirus vaccine candidates by immunizing people and then deliberately infecting them. The government will decide which vaccines to test, but it has not announced them yet.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is possible that by early next year, some of the vaccine candidates now undergoing trials will have already received approval.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But experts in medical ethics are divided over whether such a study is acceptable, largely because there is no highly effective treatment for Covid-19. The Imperial College London researchers said they would use the antiviral medicine remdesivir, but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/health/Covid-treatments-remdesivir.html" title="">that drug has been found to have only modest benefit</a>. Most other challenge trials have involved diseases like cholera and typhoid, which can be quickly and reliably cured with drugs.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Another concern is that the illness caused by the coronavirus is unpredictable, and although young people in general do not become gravely ill, there have been unexpected and unexplained cases of severe illness in young patients.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The trial will need approval from Britain&#8217;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before volunteers are enrolled, and it will be monitored by independent experts once it begins, the researchers said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">At least initially, the challenge trial will involve only young, healthy volunteers, meaning the findings may not fully apply to the people at greatest risk of severe illness from Covid-19 &#8212; older people and those with underlying health problems.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The researchers said volunteers would be compensated for their time taking part in the trial and their two to three weeks in quarantine following infection. About 2,000 people in Britain have expressed interest in taking part in challenge trials through an American group, 1Day Sooner, that advocates for such studies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The trial will be run by Imperial College London together with hVivo, a company that specializes in human challenge trials. It will initially be held at a hospital in north London.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-mueller" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="manchester-will-be-put-under-britains-highest-level-of-alert-as-european-countries-ratchet-up-restrictions"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#manchester-will-be-put-under-britains-highest-level-of-alert-as-european-countries-ratchet-up-restrictions">Manchester will be put under Britain&#8217;s highest level of alert as European countries ratchet up restrictions.</a></h2><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</p><p class="css-mm3pwi"></p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20virus-briefing-manchester/20virus-briefing-manchester-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"><p></p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said the highest level of coronavirus restrictions would be imposed for Manchester, which includes forbidding indoor socializing by people from different households.</p><p class="css-cch8ym"><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Jon Super/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain announced on Tuesday that Greater Manchester, the country&#8217;s second-largest urban area, would be put under the highest level of virus restrictions, shutting many pubs and bars and forbidding indoor socializing by people from different households.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The announcement came despite <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/world/europe/coronavirus-manchester-britain.html" title="">opposition from the area&#8217;s mayor</a>, Andy Burnham, who had pushed for greater financial aid for affected residents, and amid a spike in cases around Europe that has reinvigorated the debate over how to balance economic and health concerns.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I know these restrictions are tough on businesses and on individuals,&#8221; Mr. Johnson said. &#8220;Not to act would put Manchester&#8217;s N.H.S. and the lives of many of Manchester&#8217;s residents at risk.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Johnson pointed to the area&#8217;s growing outbreak &#8212; it has reported more cases over the last seven days than any other place in England, according to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">Times database</a>. He added that he hoped that local officials would work with the central government to implement the restrictions, which take effect Friday.  </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The government will provide some 22 million pounds in aid, which Mr. Burnham argued was woefully insufficient.

As a result of this, we can see some evidence that these restrictions have been effective in slowing the growth and spread of the virus. However, as the daily figures show, these restrictions on their own have not been enough to significantly reduce the levels of infection. The government has decided that the evidence of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead is now too strong. Therefore, for a period of six weeks, from midnight on Wednesday night, the entire country will move to Level 5 of the framework for living with Covid-19. Even as the winter comes in, there is hope and there is light. If we pull together over the next six weeks, we will have the opportunity to celebrate Christmas in a meaningful way. Every Christmas is important, but this year it is particularly so.</p></dd></dl><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/world/20virus-briefing-ireland-1/20virus-briefing-ireland-1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"><p></p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Ireland will impose a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus cases with the hope of reopening in time for Christmas.</p><p class="css-cch8ym"><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Paul Faith/Agence France-Presse &#8212; Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And in Italy&#8217;s northern region of Lombardy, the original center of the country&#8217;s outbreak, officials announced that they intended to impose a curfew aimed at curbing nightlife, especially in Milan, starting Thursday. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The curfew is the best solution to hit the contagion, and it shouldn&#8217;t have serious repercussions on the economic situation,&#8221; Lombardy&#8217;s president, Attilio Fontana, told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica on Tuesday, &#8220;It will allow us to avoid stricter measures.&#8221;</p><a class="css-1a9ghz5" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html"><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/us/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps-promo-1601396059552/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps-promo-1601396059552-articleLarge-v65.png"><h2 class="css-zd32qr">Covid World Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak</h2><p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has infected more than 40,569,500 people  and has been detected in nearly every country.</p></a><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president of Campania, in southern Italy, said on Tuesday that he would also request a curfew.

If the students are moved around within that time, the thinking goes, no one will have had &#8220;close contact&#8221; and be required to stay home if a classmate tests positive.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Greg Upham, the superintendent of the 16,500-student school district, said in an interview that contact tracing had become a huge burden for the district, and administrators were looking for a way to ease the burden when they came up with the movement idea. It was not intended to &#8220;game the system,&#8221; he said, but rather to encourage the staff to be cognizant of the 15-minute window.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In an email to administrators last week, Mr. Upham encouraged staff to &#8220;whenever possible, disrupt the 15-minute timeline through movement, distancing, and masking.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Infectious disease experts say that moving students around every few minutes is actually more likely to increase transmission of the virus, by exposing more people to an infected student. It will also complicate contact tracing efforts, they said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;That is not an evidence-based practice or sound scientific policy,&#8221; said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security who has been supportive of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/coronavirus-schools.html" title="">reopening schools</a> for in-person instruction.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The 15-minute, 6-foot definition is a guideline for identifying who might be at greater risk of infection, not a hard-and-fast rule about when it can or cannot happen, Dr. Nuzzo said, adding that a person can certainly become infected in less time or from farther away, especially indoors.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard&#8217;s school of public health, said the 15-minute definition was meant to help contact tracers &#8220;effectively and efficiently identify people with the highest risk and target intervention to them.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Kelly Hornby, principal of Billings West High School, wrote in an email to his staff last week that moving students around every few minutes and then returning them to their original desks would help dissipate airborne droplets containing coronavirus, to the point &#8220;where the risk of being contaminated is greatly reduced.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Fortune disagreed with that idea. &#8220;The particles that transmit Covid, they hang out in the air, and they spread through the air, and the aerosols can hang out for a very long time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So stirring that air up or moving around from your spot doesn&#8217;t really limit your exposure or risk.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  </p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="all-62-residents-of-a-kansas-nursing-home-caught-the-virus-in-two-weeks"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#all-62-residents-of-a-kansas-nursing-home-caught-the-virus-in-two-weeks">All 62 residents of a Kansas nursing home caught the virus in two weeks.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="The Andbe Home, a privately owned nursing home facility in Norton, Kan., that has announced &#8220;a full Covid outbreak.&#8221;" class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20virus-briefing-kansas/merlin_178803531_b57624c0-3110-4076-94dc-e95df3a01653-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The Andbe Home, a privately owned nursing home facility in Norton, Kan., that has announced &#8220;a full Covid outbreak.&#8221;</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Dana M.

But it gained new urgency this fall, as the difficulties of remote learning deepened disparities in student performance.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Only 7.2 percent of white students in San Diego&#8217;s secondary schools received grades of D or F in the last school year, according to district data, compared with 20 percent of Black students, more than 22 percent of Latino students and more than 23 percent of Native American students.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Forty-six percent of the district&#8217;s students overall are Latino, 12 percent are Asian-Pacific Islander, 8 percent are Black and a small proportion are Native American, he said. Two-thirds of the teachers are white.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We focused on becoming an anti-racist school district,&#8221; Mr. Barrera said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The grading change has drawn criticism from some conservatives, who say it diminishes the idea of academic excellence. But Kevin Beiser, a trustee who teaches middle-school math in a nearby district, said standards-based grading is meant to mitigate inequities like teachers conflating behavior with academic achievement, or affluent students having greater access to tutors.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter when you learn how to solve for x in algebra, as long as you learn it before the end of the school year,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-hubler" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-attacks-fauci-again-the-day-after-calling-him-a-disaster"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-attacks-fauci-again-the-day-after-calling-him-a-disaster">Trump attacks Fauci again, the day after calling him a &#8216;disaster.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Dr. Anthony S.

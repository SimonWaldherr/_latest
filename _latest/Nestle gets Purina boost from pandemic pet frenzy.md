  Nestle gets Purina boost from pandemic pet frenzy 
description: > 
  Nestle has boosted its sales forecast for the year amid soaring demand for its Purina pet food ranges as pet ownership increases during the pandemic.The consumer goods giant, which owns KitKat chocolate, Perrier water and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, expected sales to grow by about 3pc this year as petcare sales continue to rise.Sales in Nestle’s Purina division, which includes brands such as Felix and Bakers, climbed 11pc to SwFr10bn (£8.5bn) between January and September, sending group sales 3.5pc higher to SFr61.9bn for the period.A major shift toward home working and greater time spent at home during the pandemic has driven pet adoptions and fostering to a record high, Purina said last month.Purina is now Nestle’s second-largest division by sales after powdered and liquid beverages, which includes coffee, and 2020 is set to be the best 12 months for Purina cat and dog chow in years.

<div><p>Nestle has boosted its sales forecast for the year amid <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/30/pet-food-sales-boom-nestle-coronavirus-lockdown/">soaring demand for its Purina pet food</a> ranges as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/pet-prices-soar-lockdown-people-clamour-companionship/">pet ownership increases during the pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>The consumer goods giant, which owns KitKat chocolate, Perrier water and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, expected sales to grow by about 3pc this year as petcare sales continue to rise.&#160;It had&#160;previously forecast growth of between 2pc to 3pc.</p>
<p>Sales in Nestle&#8217;s Purina division, which includes brands such as Felix and Bakers, climbed 11pc to SwFr10bn (&#163;8.5bn) between January and September, sending group sales 3.5pc higher to SFr61.9bn for the period.&#160;</p>
<p>A major shift toward home working and greater time spent at home during the pandemic has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/03/pet-owners-urged-support-lonely-animals-return-to-work-transition/">driven pet adoptions and fostering</a> to a record high, Purina said last month.</p>
<p>Purina is now Nestle&#8217;s second-largest division by sales after powdered and liquid beverages, which includes coffee, and 2020 is set to be the best 12 months for Purina cat and dog chow in years.</p>
<p>Mark Schneider, chief executive, said: &#8220;Nestl&#233; has remained resilient in a difficult and volatile environment. Our people have acted in a responsible and prompt manner to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic and have adapted quickly to evolving consumer needs.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong organic growth was broad based and supported by sustained momentum in the Americas, Purina PetCare and Nestl&#233; Health Science, as well as the acceleration of our coffee business in the third quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Nestle&#8217;s bottled water and confectionery businesses continued to struggle during the period and both reported a fall in sales as consumers stay at home and buy fewer "on-the-go"&#160;items.&#160;</p>
<p>Online sales jumped 48pc in the nine months to account for 12pc of total sales and helping to offset a slump Nestle&#8217;s food-service business which has taken a hit amid a global downturn in the catering industry.</p>
<p>Shares were flat in afternoon trading in Zurich.&#160;</p>

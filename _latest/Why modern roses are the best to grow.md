  Why modern roses are the best to grow 
description: > 
  There’s a lot of snobbery in the gardening world, particularly when it comes to growing roses.All too often the so-called old-fashioned rose, with the fascinating history and the fancy name, is chosen for reasons of style rather than health, vigour and flower quality.When the humid months of July and August arrive, black spot (Diplocarpon rosae) strikes with vengeance and any leaves that remain are stunted, spotted and yellowed.That’s when most gardeners reach for the fungicide, in sheer desperation.The very brave dig up their sickly incumbent because they can’t stand the sight of a disfigured rose lingering on any longer.

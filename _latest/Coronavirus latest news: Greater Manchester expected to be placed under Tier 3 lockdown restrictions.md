A call between Greater Manchester leaders and 10 Downing St officials has concluded but there has been no agreement on new restrictions and there will be further meetings later today, a source has told the PA news agency.

Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Manchester Norton MP Afzal Khan both said they had not been informed of plans to place the area into a Tier 3 lockdown that were reported last night.

Over the weekend, Mr Burnham threatened legal action if a better financial plan was not offered.

Matt Hancock is due to make an announcement in the House of Commons at 11:30am.

Business minister Nadhim Zahawi appeared to suggest it was a foregone conclusion that Greater Manchester would have the most severe measures imposed.

Elsewhere, Nicola Sturgeon has advised Scots against travelling to high-risk areas of England as she singled out Blackpool as "associated with a large and growing number of Covid cases in Scotland".

Ms Sturgeon also said she backs Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford's call for the UK Government to introduce travel restrictions to prevent movement of people from areas of high prevalence into other UK nations.

President Donald Trump slammed Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James during a Friday interview with Rush Limbaugh, calling James "a hater" and "nasty spokesman."

Trump's radio interview on "The Rush Limbaugh Show" aired shortly before the Lakers-Miami Heat NBA Finals Game 5, which the Heat won 111-108.

"The NBA has become so political that nobody cares about it anymore," Trump said. He acknowledged that James is "a great basketball player," before adding: "People don’t wanna see a guy that way. They don’t want to see that. We have enough difficulty during the week, you don’t wanna sit down watching a basketball game and then watch somebody that hates your guts, OK. He’s a hater.

"LeBron has been a spokesman, I don't know I've never met him, all I know is when he endorsed Hillary," Trump said. "LeBron is a spokesman for the Democratic party. A very nasty spokesman."

James in 2017 called Trump a "bum" in a tweet, and in August, when asked about Trump's complaints about the NBA's activism to support the Black Lives Matter movement, James said, "I really don’t think the basketball community are sad about losing his viewership, him viewing the game."

James is supporting the Joe Biden campaign this year and supported the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016.

<p>The United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Tuesday morning, kicking off the largest legal challenge the tech giant has ever faced.</p><p>The case argues that Google uses a network of illegal, exclusionary business deals which disadvantage smaller competitors, building an unfair advantage in search and online advertising. Eleven states joined the Justice Department in its lawsuit.</p><p>Google is unlikely to back down from the legal fight, which could stretch out in court for years. If the government wins out over Google, the company could be forced to restructure or possibly separate parts of its business. If Google wins, the case could set a precedent sheilding several tech giants from legal scrutiny they're currently facing &#8212; but lawmakers could still aim to regulate or break up tech companies through new laws.</p><p>The DOJ lawsuit argues that Google unfairly pays smartphone manufacturers to place its apps front-and-center by pre-installing them on handsets. It pays for this using revenue from its advertising platform, the DOJ will argue.</p>

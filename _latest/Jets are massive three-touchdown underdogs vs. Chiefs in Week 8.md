<div><p>Bettors no longer have to wonder how big an underdog the New York Jets will be in Week 8 when they meet the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. The answer &#8212; 21 points &#8212; could be found in the lookahead lines released Tuesday by the Westgate SuperBook of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Surprised it&#8217;s not higher? Westgate oddsmaker Ed Salmons told The Post the three-touchdown line was made with the expectation Sam Darnold will play in the Nov. 1 game. Darnold has missed the last two games with a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder. His status for this Sunday&#8217;s home game against the Buffalo Bills is not yet known.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that the Jets have been good with Darnold, but they&#8217;re better than they&#8217;ve been with Joe Flacco,&#8221; Salmons said. &#8220;They&#8217;re still a professional football team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Salmons says the line would be closer to 23.5 or 24 if Darnold were out of the picture, he does not expect the number to approach record territory. The largest NFL point spread is widely accepted to be the Steelers as 27-point favorites over the expansion, winless Buccaneers in 1976 (Pittsburgh covered in a 42-0 blowout). In 2013, the Broncos were 26.5-point favorites over the Jaguars, but failed to cover in a 35-19 victory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last year in Week 3, with Darnold sidelined with mononucleosis, the Jets <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/17/utterly-insane-jets-patriots-line-could-go-higher/">opened as 23-point underdogs at New England</a>. The line climbed a half point before plummeting to 20.5 at kickoff. The Jets were down 30-0 late in the third quarter but ended up covering the spread with a special teams fumble recovery and a Jamal Adams interception return off backup QB Jarrett Stidham.</p>
<p>Salmons said that ending is a perfect example of why 20-point spreads are rarities in the NFL.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t take much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like college football. There&#8217;s no motivation for a team to win 50-0.&#8221;</p>

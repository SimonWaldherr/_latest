description: > 
  Donald Trump derided Joe Biden’s smaller campaign crowds and socially-distanced rallies, and claimed Democrats “couldn’t catch Covid no matter what” they did.Suggesting that smaller campaign crowds indicated the Democrat was less popular with voters, Mr Trump said in North Carolina on Wednesday that Mr Biden “can't fill them up”.Thousands have packed into similar events over several months, as Mr Trump and his supporters eschewed masks, social distancing, and government recommendations.“You couldn’t catch Covid no matter what you did,” said Mr Trump on Wednesday, as he recalled a conversation with police about crowds at a previous campaign event.They can’t fill them up,” continued Mr Trump, as he went on to mock socially-distanced crowds, and drew circles in the air.

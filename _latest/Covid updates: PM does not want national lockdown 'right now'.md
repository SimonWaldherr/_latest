Much of the focus has been on restrictions changing today in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Within the health service, preparation for treating patients in a second wave is stepping up.

On an industrial estate in Sunderland, this building could soon be saving lives.

The Nightingale Hospital has 460 beds and until now has never been used. Along with the sites in Harrogate and Manchester, it’s getting ready for the next phase of the pandemic as patient numbers continue to rise.

It will be up to local clinicians to decide whether the Nightingale beds are used for coronavirus patients, or for those who don’t have the virus and still need urgent treatment.

It’s not surprising that these buildings are now on standby. Figures suggest that out of the ten hardest hit local authorities in the UK, six are in the north of England.

These Nightingale hospitals are getting ready to take some of that pressure.

Twitter, the popular micro-blogging service, saw its service interrupted Thursday afternoon of the eve of two televised presidential campaign town halls.

"We know people are having trouble Tweeting and using Twitter," the company said in a statement. "We’re working to fix this issue as quickly as possible. We’ll share more when we have it and Tweet from @TwitterSupport when we can – stay tuned."

Twitter directed readers to the website https://status.twitterstat.us/ where it keeps people up to date on Twitter status. Twitter confirmed that status was down on the website.

However, by 7:30 p.m. ET, service had restored to some users.

The outage initially started at around 5:30 p.m. ET, reported the Verge and is Twitter's biggest outage since February, which let users come with a novel workaround by scheduling tweets. That didn't work Thursday.

In July, Twitter saw another outage that was described as an internal hack that hit the accounts of notables including former president Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

The new outage follows reports that Senate Republicans had demanded a public appearance by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in response to tweets from president Donald Trump being flagged and taken down Wednesday for providing misinformation.

The company suffered a major service failure earlier this year when the Twitter accounts of some of the most famous people in the country were compromised as part of an apparent bitcoin scam in July. Victims included Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Twitter added in a statement that "we have no evidence of a security breach or hack, and we're currently investigating internal causes."

  In Texas Towns Gutted by Covid-19, a Fragile Effort to Sustain a Cherished Sport 
description: > 
  “Every player tested neg.”The text message seemed full of relief as much as hope.A day later, Lerma sent an ominous update.“Big left tackle tested positive.”This was what everyone had feared as the fall sports season approached.During such a crisis, Palmview High School’s fragile effort to hold a football season might seem inconsequential.But the game is perhaps more urgent and galvanizing in Texas than anywhere else.

But the game is perhaps more urgent and galvanizing in Texas than anywhere else. As towns along or near the Rio Grande &#8212; like La Joya, Palmview, Mission, Progreso, Weslaco, Rio Hondo &#8212; have shut off their Friday night lights, or left them flickering in uncertainty, there has been a sense of cultural casualty.</p></div>

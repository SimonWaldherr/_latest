  OSHA Under Fire Over Regulation of Meatpacking in Pandemic 
description: > 
  OSHA’s oversight of the meatpacking industry has been in the spotlight in a case filed by workers at a Maid-Rite plant in Dunmore, Pa., accusing the agency of lax regulation.When OSHA finds that conditions pose an “imminent danger” to workers, it typically intervenes quickly and asks the employer to mitigate the risk.The OSHA area director said that of nearly 300 Covid-related complaints his office had received at the time, it had not deemed any an imminent danger.The agency inspected the Maid-Rite plant on July 9, months after the initial complaint, finding that many workers were spaced two to three feet apart with no barriers separating them.A Labor Department lawyer said at the hearing that OSHA was still studying the feasibility of requiring the company to space them farther apart.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">OSHA&#8217;s oversight of the meatpacking industry has been in the spotlight in a case filed by workers at a Maid-Rite plant in Dunmore, Pa., accusing the agency of lax regulation.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The suit contended that OSHA had done little for weeks after a worker filed a complaint in April describing insufficient precautions amid an outbreak at the plant, and after other workers filed a complaint in May asserting that they faced &#8220;imminent danger&#8221; because of the risk of infection there.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">When OSHA finds that conditions pose an &#8220;imminent danger&#8221; to workers, it typically intervenes quickly and asks the employer to mitigate the risk. But in a hearing before a federal judge in late July, a local OSHA official testified that she did not consider the term to be appropriate in the Maid-Rite case.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The official said that because OSHA&#8217;s central office had designated all meatpacking facilities to be &#8220;medium risk,&#8221; the agency would not rush to conduct a formal inspection absent some &#8220;outlying&#8221; issue. The OSHA area director said that of nearly 300 Covid-related complaints his office had received at the time, it had not deemed any an imminent danger.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The agency inspected the Maid-Rite plant on July 9, months after the initial complaint, finding that many workers were spaced two to three feet apart with no barriers separating them. A Labor Department lawyer said at the hearing that OSHA was still studying the feasibility of requiring the company to space them farther apart.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">A Maid-Rite spokeswoman said the company was following guidelines suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &#8220;as we have been since they were released.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">OSHA has also been accused by union officials and even company executives of having been slow to visit the two meatpacking facilities that it has cited so far.</p></div>

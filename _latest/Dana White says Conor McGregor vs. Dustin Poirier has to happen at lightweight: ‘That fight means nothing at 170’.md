  Dana White says Conor McGregor vs. Dustin Poirier has to happen at lightweight: ‘That fight means nothing at 170’

  If the fight between Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirier is finalized for Jan. 23, the former UFC champions better be ready for a weight cut.“It’s 155 pounds,” White confirmed when speaking to BT Sport.Neither one of those two are ranked at 170 pounds and it doesn’t do anything in the [155] pound division if either one of them win cause they’re fighting at 170.One thing Conor doesn’t do, Conor doesn’t commit to a fight and then not fight.Conor fights.”

<div><p id="9dpc1o">If the fight between <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1859/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/233/dustin-poirier">Dustin Poirier</a> is finalized for Jan. 23, the former UFC champions better be ready for a weight cut.</p>
<p id="pTkxKm">Despite McGregor previously competing at welterweight for fights against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/365/nate-diaz">Nate Diaz</a> and Donald &#8220;Cowboy&#8221; Cerrone, and Poirier saying numerous times that he&#8217;s willing to move to 170 pounds for the right opportunity, their proposed bout has to take place in the lightweight division.</p>
<p id="XAd5zG">That&#8217;s according to UFC president <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a>, who shot down any potential catch weight or welterweight fight between McGregor and Poirier as the promotion works towards booking that matchup in early 2021.</p>
<p id="O30WnN">&#8220;It&#8217;s 155 pounds,&#8221; White confirmed when speaking to <a href="https://twitter.com/btsportufc/status/1318839944786415621">BT Sport</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m not putting on a freaking multi-million dollar fight at a catch weight that means nothing. That fight means nothing at 170. Neither one of those two are ranked at 170 pounds and it doesn&#8217;t do anything in the [155] pound division if either one of them win cause they&#8217;re fighting at 170. It literally makes no sense.</p>
<p id="X7HCK2">&#8220;There are plenty of organizations that put on fights that make no sense. You can go and watch those kinds of fights every weekend. That&#8217;s not what we do here.&#8221;</p>
<p id="6LGFjq">Despite White&#8217;s proclamation, the UFC did allow McGregor to compete at 170 pounds in his most recent outing against Cerrone and it was previously stated that a win in that fight <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2020/1/16/21069755/dana-white-if-conor-mcgregor-wins-at-ufc-246-he-will-get-that-shot-title-against-khabib-nurmagomedov">would put him back into title contention at lightweight.</a></p>
<p id="69Xi2O">McGregor proceeded to steamroll Cerrone inside one-minute in the opening round but he never got the chance to compete for gold again after the coronavirus pandemic threw the UFC schedule into upheaval.</p>
<p id="RPFoaD">Regardless, White is adamant that McGregor and Poirier compete at lightweight, especially with the winner likely taking a huge step forward towards a title shot against either <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1480/khabib-nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> or <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1526/justin-gaethje">Justin Gaethje</a>, who meet in the <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1140/ufc-254">UFC 254</a> main event this weekend.</p>
<p id="WEQRcv">As far as the likelihood that McGregor returns to face Poirier in January, White says nothing is a done deal just yet but all signs are pointing in that direction.</p>
<p id="1DeCC1">Both fighters have publicly accepted the fight and the date on social media.</p>
<p id="3au3XT">&#8220;We&#8217;ve offered the fight. We got him his own date,&#8221; White said about McGregor&#8217;s return. &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t a date, that date didn&#8217;t exist. We worked with ESPN, we got him his own date and we&#8217;ve offered them the fight.</p>
<p id="OYLhzB">&#8220;I know that contracts haven&#8217;t been signed yet. Conor likes to play games. Conor plays games and he does his thing. One thing Conor doesn&#8217;t do, Conor doesn&#8217;t commit to a fight and then not fight. Conor fights.&#8221;</p>

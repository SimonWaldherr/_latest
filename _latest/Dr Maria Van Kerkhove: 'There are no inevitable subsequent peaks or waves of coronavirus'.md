<div><p>And when it comes to science, women are also in the lead; WHO&#8217;s Covid-19 response team being one example, of which I&#8217;m very proud. It&#8217;s not only me and Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO&#8217;s Chief Scientist, but many of our technical experts are women. As a matter of fact, overall at the WHO, women hold <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/women-and-girls/breaking-glass-ceiling-woman-looking-health-billion-africans/">60 per cent of senior leadership positions</a>. Representation matters, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m convinced of. That&#8217;s why I allow myself to hope that little boys and girls watching the news these days are taking note, so that they know that this is possible for them too.</p>
<p>That said, with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/do-female-leaders-seem-good-tackling-coronavirus-pandemic/">examples of women in leadership</a>, the reality out there is that while women deliver health, men lead it. Women struggle to rise up the ranks of both health and science. In strong contrast to the figures within WHO, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/women-and-girls/breaking-glass-ceiling-woman-looking-health-billion-africans/">women occupy only a quarter of health leadership positions</a>. Women also make up just 12 per cent of the membership of national science academies, and that needs to change.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t afford to ignore women&#8217;s expertise in public health responses; we need to do more to ensure gender-equal decision making or we lose out on the crucial knowledge of those providing care. We need more women and girls in STEM-related fields.</p>
<h4>What can countries do to avoid&#160;lethal second waves,&#160;and for its part&#160;what will the WHO do?</h4>
<p>While it is true that the threat of a resurgence is always present, there are no inevitable subsequent peaks or &#8220;waves&#8217;. The trajectory of this pandemic is in our hands, as it has been since the beginning.</p>
<p>We must remain diligent and vigilant but optimistic in our efforts. WHO outlined a strategic preparedness and response plan for Covid-19 some four days after we declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30 this year <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/01/30/declares-global-emergency-coronavirus-says-has-confidence-china/">with a global goal to suppress transmission, save lives and livelihoods</a>.</p>
<p>These goals remain the same today. WHO Director-General Dr&#160;Tedros has called on governments, communities and individuals to focus on four essential actions to stop the pandemic, prevent amplifying events, and reduce deaths by protecting vulnerable groups.&#160;All of us need to play our part by following the advice that prevents infections.</p>
<p>This includes staying at least one metre away from others,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-can-survive-skin-nine-hours-researchers-find/amp/"> cleaning hands</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/event-r-new-maths-helping-explain-superspreader-events/">avoiding the 3 &#8216;C&#8217;s</a>, being informed and engaged, staying at home if unwell, following local guidance, and so on. Finally, governments must carry out consistent public health actions to find, isolate, test and care for cases, and trace and quarantine contacts.</p>

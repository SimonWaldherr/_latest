Normal service has been resumed in Paris where Rafael Nadal (who else) and Novak Djokovic line up to contest their 56th career battle today in the French Open final.

After Dominic Thiem and Alexander Zverev metaphorically held the big three's beer at the US Open, the top two players lock horns again for a grand slam title.

Today history will be made when either Nadal or Djokovic lift La Coupe des Mousquetaires (is there a cooler sounding trophy in sport?Answers on a postcard pleaseâ€¦) on Philippe Chatrier Court later today.

Djokovic would become the first man in the Open Era to win all four majors on multiple occasions should he win his second French Open title.

The Serbian was expected to arrive in Paris with an 18th grand slam title under his belt by winning at Flushing Meadows last month, which Nadal skipped due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.

But the 33-year-old was disqualified in his fourth-round match at Flushing Meadows when he inadvertently hit a line judge with the ball.

Nadal is one behind Roger Federer's haul of 20 majors and a 13th French Open title on Sunday would therefore bring him level with the Swiss, leaving Djokovic three adrift.

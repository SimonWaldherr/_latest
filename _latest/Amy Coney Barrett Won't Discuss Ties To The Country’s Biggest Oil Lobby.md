<p>&#8220;The question of recusal is a threshold question of law that must be addressed in the context of the facts of each case,&#8221; Barrett wrote in her response. &#8220;As Justice Ginsburg described the process that Supreme Court justices go through in deciding whether to recuse, it involves reading the statute, reviewing precedents, and consulting with colleagues. As a sitting judge and as a judicial nominee, it would not be appropriate for me to offer an opinion on abstract legal issues or hypotheticals. Such questions can only be answered through the judicial process.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>That answer stands in contrast to her written response about cases involving Shell and its affiliates.</p><p>&#8220;My father worked at Shell Oil Company for many years, and while on the Seventh Circuit, in an abundance of caution, I have recused myself from cases involving those Shell entities with which he was involved,&#8221; she wrote.</p><p>API wields tremendous influence over policymaking at the federal and state level and markets the industry directly to consumers. Earlier this month, the group released a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfmNz0Epujo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new TV ads</a> that paint a misleading picture of the most recent science on emissions from natural gas.</p><p>The organization has been peddling climate misinformation for decades. In 1998, API <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-climate-panel-american-petroleum-institute-1998-campaign_n_5d129d6fe4b04f059e4b3d18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hatched plans</a> for a multiyear, multimillion dollar campaign to sow doubt about the threat of climate change, including developing a media kit with research papers that &#8220;undercut the &#8216;conventional wisdom&#8217; on climate science,&#8221; as detailed in a new infamous memo.</p><p>&#8220;Coney Barrett&#8217;s corporate activism and bent are well-documented, but her nonanswers on these serious conflicts of interest involving one [of] the largest big oil corporations in the world and one of their dirty lobby associations tell us everything we need to know about her climate denial,&#8221; Jayson O&#8217;Neill, a spokesperson for the watchdog group Accountable.US, told HuffPost in an email. &#8220;And, it&#8217;s clearly disqualifying.&#8221;</p>

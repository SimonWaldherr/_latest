England will be carved up into three tiers of measures to try and control the spread of coronavirus infections, it was announced today.

Boris Johnson this evening addressed the nation to lay out the three tiers which range from medium, to high, to very high.

Only the Liverpool city regions are in the third tier.

England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty warned even the strictest of measures will not be enough on their own, appearing to encourage local leaders to go further.

He also the Downing Street press conference: "The idea that we can do this without causing harm is an illusion.

"It is a balancing act between two harms: a harm for society and the economy on the one hand and a harm for health on the other hand."

Earlier today it was announced that three temporary Nightingale hospitals in the north of England could be brought back into use to deal with the spike in coronavirus cases.

Following a first look, we now have more imagery of the NBA and Louis Vuitton collaborative sneaker rumored to release as part of a partnership announced at the start of the year.

The ankle boot style follows LV’s creeper boot with a chunky, treaded outsole accented by Monogram flowers at the heel. Inspired by the classic look of Timberland boots, the footwear option features a light-brown suede construction marked with the NBA logo on the tongue and gold-foil stampings. The collaborative branding is continued on the accompany shoe tag and the printed insoles accompanying the leather-lined interior. Despite the better look, there is still no word on if or when the NBA x Louis Vuitton sneaker will be releasing.

  Glenn Greenwald trashes media 'cone of silence' around Hunter Biden email scandal 
description: > 
  The Intercept founding editor Glenn Greenwald accussed the mainstream media Monday of "blatant rank-closing and [implementing a] cone of silence" around last week's New York Post bombshell reports detailing Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings."I don't think that the emails -- so far -- reveal a huge scandal," Greenwald wrote on Twitter.The huge scandal to me is the blatant rank-closing and cone of silence -- a prohibition -- erected *by journalists* around this story to defend Biden.""When you report a huge archive, there's no way to prove the negative that none of it is altered," Greenwald explained."It’s been going on for four straight years now," he claimed, "and there’s no sign of it stopping anytime soon."

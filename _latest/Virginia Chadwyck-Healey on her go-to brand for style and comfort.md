<p>Toast not only sells a dream lifestyle, it makes exceptionally good clothes too. Although born when the world was in tune with speed in everything &#8211; from media to fashion to food delivery &#8211; Toast made strides in curating simple, functional, beautiful clothing. The brand made a clever move when it was stocked at John Lewis &amp; Partners. This opened it up to the likes of you and me, who wanted to see the collection alongside those brands we might already own in our wardrobe (Hush; Ralph Lauren; Hobbs; Barbour). We could go into the changing room and throw all the brands together to picture our style more realistically. The days of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/will-try-clothes-in-store-lockdown/">changing rooms</a> feel a distant memory right now so, today, I am here to guide you.&#160;</p>
<p>Firstly, Toast comes up big, so you will need to veer towards a smaller size (great if you have curves). Toast loves a boxy fit, so anyone who wants a shape-enhancing look should consider the classic needlecord skirts or the silk dupion shirts (tucked in). Toast is great for those who wear boots or trainers &#8211; they sell a range of shoe styles. You are unlikely to wear Toast to the boardroom (although post-Covid, who knows what may be possible). If you like the idea of The Good Life crossed with Sloane-does-Somerset, then this is for you. Earthy tones, snug and warm. As if you suddenly found yourself living in a modern-day Beatrix Potter tale. As an aside, I bet Mrs Monty Don loves Toast, too, and I think you all know that I wouldn&#8217;t mind living in her world.</p>

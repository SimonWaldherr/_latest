Apple Apple is replacing the iTunes app in macOS Catalina with three separate apps: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV.

Apple is nixing the iTunes app in the next version of its Mac software, which launched on Monday.

With macOS Catalina, the contents of iTunes will now be split up between three apps: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV.

Here’s what will happen to your library of music, movies, podcasts, and shows.

It’s official: iTunes is dead.

Apple announced last June at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference that the standalone iTunes app would be killed off when the company rolled out its new macOS operating system. On Monday, that software began rolling out to Mac users.

Under macOS Catalina, as the new version of the Mac operating system is called, Apple is nixing iTunes in favour of three apps: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV.

For die-hard iTunes users – the people who have been storing music, movies, and shows in there for years and have an extensive library built up – this might sound scary. What will become of all your stuff?

Don’t worry – it probably isn’t going anywhere. Here’s what will happen to iTunes in macOS Catalina.

Apple Music will become the home for all things, well, music.

Apple is redesigning the Music app for Macs to accommodate the elimination of iTunes.

Now your entire music library will live inside one app, including downloaded songs, purchased songs, and songs ripped from a CD, according to Apple.

Plus, you can still buy songs if you really want to: Apple will still offer an iTunes Store.

The Apple TV app is coming to the Mac.

Starting this fall, the Apple TV app will live on all of your devices – iPhone, iPad, Mac, and, of course, your Apple TV.

That means that rather than renting movies and TV shows through iTunes on your Mac, you’ll watch everything through the Apple TV app. Apple said that more than 100,000 iTunes shows and movies will be available to rent or buy through this new app.

The app will include Apple TV channels, so you can stream shows and movies from your favourite channels and services (although that’s less necessary on a Mac where you can also just watch them on the channel’s website).

On top of that, the app will contain Apple’s original streaming service, Apple TV Plus, once it becomes available this fall.

Apple Podcasts will now be a one-stop shop for all of your podcasts.

The way it works right now, there’s a Podcasts app on the iPhone, but there’s also a Podcasts section of iTunes on the Mac. This doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, and thankfully, Apple is changing that.

Now there will be a standalone Podcasts app on the Mac that should work the same as the one on your phone. Apple said it would offer more than 700,000 shows, as well as perks like the ability to get a notification when there’s a new episode of one of your favourite shows.

Plus, the app will feature curated collections and better search tools to help you find new podcasts to listen to.

There’s one more crucial change involving iTunes coming in macOS Catalina.

You know how right now, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac, iTunes opens automatically? Isn’t it annoying?

Well, Apple seems to have realised this because in macOS Catalina, nothing will happen when you plug your phone into your computer. Seriously – Apple even did a demo of this onstage at WWDC to prove it.

Now when you plug your phone in, you’ll see your device in the sidebar of your Finder and nothing more.

However, Apple isn’t eliminating using a cable to sync your phone and computer altogether – you’ll still be able to sync your media that way, but you’ll do it through the individual apps for music, movies, and podcasts.

<div><p>From Silicon Valley&#8217;s point of view, this stalemate has been a perfectly acceptable state of affairs. Political gridlock has left them relatively free to keep growing, becoming more powerful than ever even as concerns about that power continue to rise.</p>
<p>The problem is that eventually, those concerns can boil over. Last week, both Facebook and Twitter provoked a tremendous level of fury from the Trump campaign when they censored an apparent New York Post expos&#233; of Joe Biden and his son, on the grounds <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/14/facebook-twitter-spark-republican-fury-cutting-traffic-disputed/">the story may be false&#160;or based on hacked materials</a>.</p>
<p>Even if widely disputed, limiting the reach of a major US newspaper (Facebook downgraded its ranking in news feeds, while Twitter blocked people from posting the link altogether, before backtracking and applying a &#8220;warning label&#8221;), was a step into unprecedented territory.</p>
<p>Republicans promptly demanded that Dorsey and Zuckerberg testify over the decision&#160;and pushed forward on plans to reform Section 230, the longstanding internet law that allows online platforms to moderate material without being classed as a publisher.</p>
<p>Internet companies should fear what comes next. Although it is as true as ever the two parties disagree on what is wrong in Silicon Valley, last week&#8217;s actions brought a new energy to Republican anger against Big Tech. It will persist long after the election if, as polls suggest, Trump loses next month.</p>
<p>The idea that &#8220;something must be done&#8221;, even if the two sides cannot agree on what, increases the chances that politicians will take the most blunt and drastic action. If it is unanimously agreed that tech companies are too big, the doomsday scenario of breaking them up might be the only thing Republicans and Democrats can agree on.</p>
<p>An alternative might be repealing Section 230 altogether, which would force major changes to their business models.</p>
<p>The prospect of either of these remedies will worry tech bosses far more than other measures on the table, such as giving users more control of their data or restrictions on future acquisitions.</p>
<p>And yet, last week seemed to bring us closer to such a prospect. Disagreements on how to deal with tech companies have so far kept regulators at bay. The political rage that last week&#8217;s actions from Facebook and Twitter incited may change that.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg and Dorsey could regret their interventions more than they know.&#160;</p>

Gabby Galluzzo, a 23-year-old living in Portland, Oregon, this summer, was planning to move to Los Angeles after lockdown, but instead headed East.

"It was kind of something that fell into my lap," Galluzzo says of her decision to move to New York City in September, after staying with family during the summer. "I was going to sign a lease in L.A., but it just wasn't feeling right for me. Some of the people in my COVID family told me that rent is so cheap right now in New York and said I should think about it."

Galluzzo has been in the city for a month, on a trial basis, but already thinks she made the right call. "Because of how low the rent is, I'm considering staying," she says.

It's possible others may soon follow in her footsteps.

The median rental price in Manhattan was down 7.1% in September compared to the same time last year, according to a report from real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel Inc. and real estate company Douglas Elliman. The lower rents, fueled by vacancies, reflect the city's trauma since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The city, which was once the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak , has seen 23,905 deaths as a result of the virus, according to the New York Times . The unemployment rate in the Big Apple was 16% in August – about twice the national average .

Yet, despite people leaving the city in droves, others are still eager to cash in on the lower rents. September saw 5,018 leases signed in Manhattan, almost identical to last year's numbers.

"New leases have equaled last year, and the reason they've done that is because rental prices have come down, and that has pulled people in," says Jonathan Miller, president and CEO of Miller Samuel Inc. "So what we're seeing is more and more people coming in to take advantage of a greater affordability in the rental market."

After the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a rise in unemployment, particularly among low-wage workers more likely to rent, outbound migration to the suburbs accelerated, Miller says. What remains is a roomier city, with three times as many available rental listings as last year, at 15,923 – a 14-year record.

"We have the highest vacancy rate we've ever tracked, at 5.5%," Miller says. "The amount of inventory – at almost 16,000 – is a record and it's tripled from last year. So, we're seeing rents fall."

Renters looking for smaller spaces are positioned to benefit the most from the city's lower rents, according to the report.

Median rents for studios were down 17.1% in September compared to the same time last year, with median rents at $2,184, while the median rents for one-bedrooms decreased by 14.7% to $2,977, according to the report. Two- and three-bedrooms, contrastingly, saw less than half of that decrease.

"What's happening is the lower end of the market – that studio, one-bedroom market – is seeing less demand," Miller says. "So there's a significant impact skewed against the lower price points or smaller apartments on the market."

As for when to expect rental price points to return to their usual rates, Miller says there's still decline ahead for the market. While inventory growth has slowed since this summer, it was nevertheless up 6% in September from August.

"There's still a lot of listings available, which indicates that we still have time in front of us to expect more declines in pricing," he says.

As for Galluzzo, she's confident where she's at.

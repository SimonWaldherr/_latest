  Ireland will impose a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus cases with the hope of reopening in time for Christmas.Credit Credit... Paul Faith/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images And in Italy’s northern region of Lombardy, the original center of the country’s outbreak, officials announced that they intended to impose a curfew aimed at curbing nightlife, especially in Milan, starting Thursday.Partly because the number of virus cases is not actually rising as much as the official case numbers suggest.More widespread testing means that the official numbers are capturing a larger share of new virus cases than earlier this year.The statistics on new virus cases that get so much attention are somewhat exaggerating the severity of the current outbreak, because of the rise in testing.

Neither state, nor Pennsylvania, was on a quarantine list released on Tuesday afternoon by the governor&#8217;s office.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Mr. Cuomo said that all nonessential travel among New York and the three states should be avoided and promised he would issue more guidance on that point on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">All told, Mr. Cuomo said that more than 40 places now qualified for New York&#8217;s travel advisory list, something he referred to as &#8220;really a bizarre outcome.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Tuesday, more than 64,200 new cases and at least 517 new deaths <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">were reported in the United States</a>. Over the last week, there have been an average of 59,269 cases per day, an increase of 34 percent from the average two weeks earlier, and fears are growing in New York about a potential second wave. Two weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo closed nonessential businesses in parts of Queens and Brooklyn where positivity rates had spiked.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Since late June, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have worked in concert to create a list of states from which travelers to the region are subject to a two-week quarantine.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Essential workers</a> have been exempt from the quarantine since it began in June, and Mr. Cuomo did not announce changes to that policy. Other workers who cross state lines have technically been subject to the advisory, but officials have also said that the quarantine is only required by those who spend at least 24 hours in a state on the list &#8212; which would exclude most commuters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The quarantine was intended to apply to any person arriving from an area with a positivity rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents over a 7-day rolling average or an area with a 10 percent or higher positivity rate over a 7-day rolling average.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">New Jersey has a population of about 8.88 million people, and so anything over an average of about 888 new cases puts the state above that threshold. According to a New York Times database, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html#cases" title="">New Jersey has seen an average of 1,016 cases per day</a> in the last week, an increase of 54 percent from the average two weeks earlier.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For Connecticut, the threshold is around 356, and its daily average in the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/connecticut-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">last week was at 378 cases per day</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Though New York has seen a significant increase in cases in parts of New York City and its suburbs, its overall positivity rate has remained lower than its neighbors.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-mckinley" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Jesse McKinley</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-gold" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-human-challenge-trial-will-begin-in-january-in-which-volunteers-are-deliberately-exposed-to-the-virus"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-human-challenge-trial-will-begin-in-january-in-which-volunteers-are-deliberately-exposed-to-the-virus">A human challenge trial will begin in January, in which volunteers are deliberately exposed to the virus.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A researcher in a laboratory at Imperial College London." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20virus-briefing-ImperialCollege/merlin_177880182_f9b69a2e-4c35-4b9d-9e13-2cc156e30055-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A researcher in a laboratory at Imperial College London.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Researchers at Imperial College London are planning to deliberately infect healthy volunteers with the coronavirus early next year as part of the world&#8217;s first effort to study how people immunized with different vaccines respond to controlled exposure to the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The study, known as a human challenge trial, is scheduled to begin in January at a quarantine facility in London with 34 million pounds, or $44 million, of British government funding, the government announced on Tuesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Such a study could save time in the race to winnow down a large number of vaccine candidates.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Rather than testing vaccines the usual way &#8212; by waiting for vaccinated people to encounter the virus in their homes and communities &#8212; researchers would expose them to the virus in a controlled setting.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the first stage of the study, scientists will try to determine the smallest doses of the virus required to infect people. The scientists will test gradually increasing doses of virus on up to 90 healthy volunteers from 18 to 30 years old until they reach a level that reliably infects them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Once they have decided on a dose &#8212; potentially by late spring, the government said &#8212; researchers will begin to compare a set of coronavirus vaccine candidates by immunizing people and then deliberately infecting them. The government will decide which vaccines to test, but it has not announced them yet.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is possible that by early next year, some of the vaccine candidates now undergoing trials will have already received approval.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But experts in medical ethics are divided over whether such a study is acceptable, largely because there is no highly effective treatment for Covid-19. The Imperial College London researchers said they would use the antiviral medicine remdesivir, but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/health/Covid-treatments-remdesivir.html" title="">that drug has been found to have only modest benefit</a>. Most other challenge trials have involved diseases like cholera and typhoid, which can be quickly and reliably cured with drugs.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Another concern is that the illness caused by the coronavirus is unpredictable, and although young people in general do not become gravely ill, there have been unexpected and unexplained cases of severe illness in young patients.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The trial will need approval from Britain&#8217;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before volunteers are enrolled, and it will be monitored by independent experts once it begins, the researchers said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">At least initially, the challenge trial will involve only young, healthy volunteers, meaning the findings may not fully apply to the people at greatest risk of severe illness from Covid-19 &#8212; older people and those with underlying health problems.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The researchers said volunteers would be compensated for their time taking part in the trial and their two to three weeks in quarantine following infection. About 2,000 people in Britain have expressed interest in taking part in challenge trials through an American group, 1Day Sooner, that advocates for such studies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The trial will be run by Imperial College London together with hVivo, a company that specializes in human challenge trials. It will initially be held at a hospital in north London.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-mueller" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="manchester-will-be-put-under-britains-highest-level-of-alert-as-european-countries-ratchet-up-restrictions"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#manchester-will-be-put-under-britains-highest-level-of-alert-as-european-countries-ratchet-up-restrictions">Manchester will be put under Britain&#8217;s highest level of alert as European countries ratchet up restrictions.</a></h2><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</p><p class="css-mm3pwi"></p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20virus-briefing-manchester/20virus-briefing-manchester-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"><p></p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said the highest level of coronavirus restrictions would be imposed for Manchester, which includes forbidding indoor socializing by people from different households.</p><p class="css-cch8ym"><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Jon Super/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain announced on Tuesday that Greater Manchester, the country&#8217;s second-largest urban area, would be put under the highest level of virus restrictions, shutting many pubs and bars and forbidding indoor socializing by people from different households.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The announcement came despite <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/world/europe/coronavirus-manchester-britain.html" title="">opposition from the area&#8217;s mayor</a>, Andy Burnham, who had pushed for greater financial aid for affected residents, and amid a spike in cases around Europe that has reinvigorated the debate over how to balance economic and health concerns.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I know these restrictions are tough on businesses and on individuals,&#8221; Mr. Johnson said. &#8220;Not to act would put Manchester&#8217;s N.H.S. and the lives of many of Manchester&#8217;s residents at risk.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Johnson pointed to the area&#8217;s growing outbreak &#8212; it has reported more cases over the last seven days than any other place in England, according to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">Times database</a>. He added that he hoped that local officials would work with the central government to implement the restrictions, which take effect Friday.  </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The government will provide some 22 million pounds in aid, which Mr. Burnham argued was woefully insufficient. Talks over relief funds collapsed shortly before the announcement was made, though Mr. Johnson indicated they could be restarted. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;At no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities through the punishing reality of the winter to come,&#8221; Mr. Burnham said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ireland on Monday became the first European country <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates/ireland-to-become-the-first-european-country-to-reimpose-a-national-lockdown" title="">to reimpose a national lockdown</a>, in a dramatic U-turn for the government, which two weeks ago fell short of imposing the highest level of restrictions despite advice from public health experts.

As a result of this, we can see some evidence that these restrictions have been effective in slowing the growth and spread of the virus. However, as the daily figures show, these restrictions on their own have not been enough to significantly reduce the levels of infection. The government has decided that the evidence of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead is now too strong. Therefore, for a period of six weeks, from midnight on Wednesday night, the entire country will move to Level 5 of the framework for living with Covid-19. Even as the winter comes in, there is hope and there is light. If we pull together over the next six weeks, we will have the opportunity to celebrate Christmas in a meaningful way. Every Christmas is important, but this year it is particularly so.</p></dd></dl><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/world/20virus-briefing-ireland-1/20virus-briefing-ireland-1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"><p></p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Ireland will impose a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus cases with the hope of reopening in time for Christmas.</p><p class="css-cch8ym"><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Paul Faith/Agence France-Presse &#8212; Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And in Italy&#8217;s northern region of Lombardy, the original center of the country&#8217;s outbreak, officials announced that they intended to impose a curfew aimed at curbing nightlife, especially in Milan, starting Thursday. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The curfew is the best solution to hit the contagion, and it shouldn&#8217;t have serious repercussions on the economic situation,&#8221; Lombardy&#8217;s president, Attilio Fontana, told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica on Tuesday, &#8220;It will allow us to avoid stricter measures.&#8221;</p><a class="css-1a9ghz5" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html"><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/us/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps-promo-1601396059552/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps-promo-1601396059552-articleLarge-v65.png"><h2 class="css-zd32qr">Covid World Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak</h2><p class="css-1uuihdo">The virus has infected more than 40,458,400 people  and has been detected in nearly every country.</p></a><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president of Campania, in southern Italy, said on Tuesday that he would also request a curfew.

One would revive a lapsed federal loan program for small businesses and the other would provide $500 billion for schools, testing and expired unemployment benefits.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump has insisted in recent days that he wants to spend more than the $2.4 trillion Ms. Pelosi has put forward in negotiations, and claimed he could easily cajole enough Senate Republicans into supporting an agreement of that size &#8212; a notion that many of them have told his top deputies would never happen.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Ms. Pelosi insisted she was optimistic a bargain could be reached and said she was intent on reaching one before a new Democratic administration began in January.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to carry over the droppings of this grotesque elephant into the next presidency,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi told her members. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get something big, and we&#8217;ve got to get it done soon and we&#8217;ve got to get it done right.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="billings-schools-montana-covid"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#billings-schools-montana-covid">To avoid quarantining students, a school district tries moving them around every 15 minutes.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Schools across the country have grappled with how to minimize virus transmission in classrooms." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20virus-briefing-school/merlin_176498445_ef3ef0fa-6482-4e91-a7b0-771e6b1eab9e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Schools across the country have grappled with how to minimize virus transmission in classrooms.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Carlo Allegri/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">To reduce the number of students sent home to quarantine after exposure to the coronavirus, the Billings Public Schools, the largest school district in Montana, came up with an idea that has public health experts shaking their heads: Reshuffling students in the classroom four times an hour.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The strategy is based on the definition of a &#8220;close contact&#8221; requiring quarantine &#8212; being within 6 feet of an infected person for 15 minutes or more. If the students are moved around within that time, the thinking goes, no one will have had &#8220;close contact&#8221; and be required to stay home if a classmate tests positive.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Greg Upham, the superintendent of the 16,500-student school district, said in an interview that contact tracing had become a huge burden for the district, and administrators were looking for a way to ease the burden when they came up with the movement idea. It was not intended to &#8220;game the system,&#8221; he said, but rather to encourage the staff to be cognizant of the 15-minute window.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In an email to administrators last week, Mr. Upham encouraged staff to &#8220;whenever possible, disrupt the 15-minute timeline through movement, distancing, and masking.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Infectious disease experts say that moving students around every few minutes is actually more likely to increase transmission of the virus, by exposing more people to an infected student. It will also complicate contact tracing efforts, they said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;That is not an evidence-based practice or sound scientific policy,&#8221; said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security who has been supportive of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/coronavirus-schools.html" title="">reopening schools</a> for in-person instruction.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The 15-minute, 6-foot definition is a guideline for identifying who might be at greater risk of infection, not a hard-and-fast rule about when it can or cannot happen, Dr. Nuzzo said, adding that a person can certainly become infected in less time or from farther away, especially indoors.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard&#8217;s school of public health, said the 15-minute definition was meant to help contact tracers &#8220;effectively and efficiently identify people with the highest risk and target intervention to them.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Kelly Hornby, principal of Billings West High School, wrote in an email to his staff last week that moving students around every few minutes and then returning them to their original desks would help dissipate airborne droplets containing coronavirus, to the point &#8220;where the risk of being contaminated is greatly reduced.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Fortune disagreed with that idea. &#8220;The particles that transmit Covid, they hang out in the air, and they spread through the air, and the aerosols can hang out for a very long time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So stirring that air up or moving around from your spot doesn&#8217;t really limit your exposure or risk.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  </p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-calls-fauci-a-disaster-and-shrugs-off-the-virus-as-infections-soar"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-calls-fauci-a-disaster-and-shrugs-off-the-virus-as-infections-soar">Trump calls Fauci a &#8216;disaster&#8217; and shrugs off the virus as infections soar.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Dr. Anthony S.

It threatened to focus the electorate squarely on the president&#8217;s coronavirus response and pitted him against Dr. Fauci, who as the nation&#8217;s top infectious disease expert is a career government scientist the public likes and trusts far more than Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In increasingly vocal terms, Dr. Fauci has been separating himself from the White House and warning Americans to &#8220;hunker down&#8221; and brace for a difficult winter &#8212; a message at odds with Mr. Trump&#8217;s repeated, if false, assurances that the nation is &#8220;rounding the corner&#8221; on a pandemic that has claimed about 220,000 American lives.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;People are tired of Covid,&#8221; Mr. Trump complained on the call, which several reporters were invited into. &#8220;I have the biggest rallies I&#8217;ve ever had. And we have Covid. People are saying: &#8216;Whatever. Just leave us alone.&#8217; They&#8217;re tired of it.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He added, &#8220;People are tired of hearing Fauci and these idiots, all these idiots who got it wrong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Later Monday, at a campaign rally in Prescott, Ariz., Mr. Trump invoked Dr. Fauci as a way of ridiculing the coronavirus plan of his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Biden wants to lock it down. He wants to listen to Dr. Fauci,&#8221; the president said, referring to coronavirus-related restrictions on the economy. (Dr. Fauci, addressing a group of pathologists last week, said no one wants to &#8220;shut down the country again.&#8221;)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Biden campaign, which has been emphasizing a promise to listen to science over politics, responded with relish: &#8220;Mr. President, you&#8217;re right about one thing: The American people are tired.

But it gained new urgency this fall, as the difficulties of remote learning deepened disparities in student performance.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Only 7.2 percent of white students in San Diego&#8217;s secondary schools received grades of D or F in the last school year, according to district data, compared with 20 percent of Black students, more than 22 percent of Latino students and more than 23 percent of Native American students.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Forty-six percent of the district&#8217;s students overall are Latino, 12 percent are Asian-Pacific Islander, 8 percent are Black and a small proportion are Native American, he said. Two-thirds of the teachers are white.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We focused on becoming an anti-racist school district,&#8221; Mr. Barrera said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The grading change has drawn criticism from some conservatives, who say it diminishes the idea of academic excellence. But Kevin Beiser, a trustee who teaches middle-school math in a nearby district, said standards-based grading is meant to mitigate inequities like teachers conflating behavior with academic achievement, or affluent students having greater access to tutors.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter when you learn how to solve for x in algebra, as long as you learn it before the end of the school year,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-hubler" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-virus-update-in-three-charts">A virus update, in three charts.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In today&#8217;s edition of the Morning newsletter, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/briefing/presidential-debate-jeffrey-toobin-coronavirus.html" title="">David Leonhardt writes</a>:</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Let&#8217;s check in on the state of the coronavirus this morning, with help from three charts. Here&#8217;s the first:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: The COVID Tracking Project, state and local health agencies and hospitals</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As you can see, the number of new virus cases in the U.S. is surging &#8212; and not far from this summer&#8217;s peak. You&#8217;re probably familiar with versions of that blue line. It is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">the most common metric</a> for tracking the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The rising line mostly reflects reality: The virus is surging, especially in the Upper Midwest. Cooler weather is leading to more indoor activity, which often leads to new cases, and many Americans seem <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/us/coronavirus-pandemic-fatigue.html" title="">tired of pandemic restrictions</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But you&#8217;ll notice that the red line on the chart &#8212; the number of Americans currently hospitalized with virus complications &#8212; looks less bad. It has risen lately, but it is not close to its peak.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Why? Partly because the number of virus cases is not actually rising as much as the official case numbers suggest.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That brings us to chart No. 2:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: The COVID Tracking Project</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The U.S. is conducting <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lot more tests</a> than in the summer or spring. More widespread testing means that the official numbers are capturing a larger share of new virus cases than earlier this year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We have probably gotten better at finding cases, as testing capacity has increased, and so we can&#8217;t directly compare the size of the waves based on case counts alone,&#8221; Caitlin Rivers of Johns Hopkins University told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good development.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The third chart also suggests some encouraging news:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: state and local health agencies and hospitals</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Even as case numbers have soared and hospitalizations have risen, deaths have held fairly steady.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That&#8217;s happened as many older people &#8212; who are most vulnerable &#8212; have been careful about avoiding exposure. A greater share of current new cases is among young Americans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The quality of virus treatments is also improving. Remdesivir, dexamethasone and monoclonal antibodies all seem to help, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/dose-covid-related-optimism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as my colleague Donald G.

The statistics on new virus cases that get so much attention are somewhat exaggerating the severity of the current outbreak, because of the rise in testing.

But the sheriff in the town of Hamilton, backed up by the Ravalli County commissioners, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/masks-montana-coronavirus.html" title="">elected not to enforce the order</a>, saying individual rights took priority.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That decision left small businesses stuck in the middle of a monthslong national conflict over mask wearing as they try to keep staff safe and their doors open without alienating customers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For the owner of River Rising Bakery, Nicki Ransier, the commissioners&#8217; decision made her life easier: &#8220;It kind of took some pressure off of us, because we&#8217;re not having that confrontation with our customers when they walk in.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Before the governor&#8217;s order, Ms. Ransier asked her staff to wear masks, but a few customers berated her employees &#8212; some of whom are in high school &#8212; over the decision. One customer told the teenagers that they were &#8220;bending the knee to tyranny&#8221; by following Mr. Bullock&#8217;s order.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Other patrons wanted Ms. Ransier to flatly require masks for all and install costly plexiglass barriers. She felt she couldn&#8217;t please anyone, so she decided her policy would focus on what she could control: employees. She would let customers choose, but ask her 14 workers to wear masks even though it can be hot and miserable.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the commissioners&#8217; move frustrated Randy Lint, the owner of Big Creek Coffee Roasters.

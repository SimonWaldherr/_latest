<div><p>The presidential debate commission will cut the candidates&#8217; mics during their final televised clash. Plus, how the Trump administration made the US dirtier</p><p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has complained that a new rule introduced for his final televised debate with Joe Biden on Thursday, whereby <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/presidential-debate-commission-adopts-rules-to-mute-microphones" class="u-underline">the candidates mics will be muted during their opponent&#8217;s responses</a>, is &#8220;very unfair&#8221;. The presidential debate commission came up with the format change after the chaotic first debate in September, during which the president interrupted Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, at least <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/09/trump-interruptions-first-presidential-debate-biden.html" class="u-underline">128 times</a>.</p>
<p>Trump has also described the moderator for the final debate, NBC&#8217;s Kristen Welker, as &#8220;extremely unfair&#8221;. Meanwhile, his campaign claims Welker&#8217;s choice of topics goes beyond what it believed would be a debate focused on foreign policy. The president will take part nonetheless, his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said, adding:</p>
<blockquote class="quoted">
<p class="inline-garnett-quote inline-icon ">


 </p>
<p>President Trump is committed to debating Joe Biden regardless of last-minute rule changes from the biased commission in their latest attempt to provide advantage to their favored candidate.</p>

<p>With coronavirus cases climbing across the US, Trump launched another broadside at Dr Anthony Fauci on Monday. &#8220;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/19/trump-fauci-idiot-experts-criticism-coronavirus" class="u-underline">People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots</a>,&#8221; the president said in a call to his campaign staff, describing the administration&#8217;s top pandemic expert as a &#8220;disaster&#8221; and moaning: &#8220;Every time he goes on television, there&#8217;s always a bomb &#8211; but there&#8217;s a bigger bomb if you fire him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s anger was apparently sparked by an interview Fauci gave to CBS&#8217;s 60 Minutes, in which he said the White House had blocked him from appearing on &#8220;many, many, many shows&#8221; that requested similar interviews &#8211; and admitted he was &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; surprised that Trump recently contracted Covid-19, given his lax approach to safety measures.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Atlas </strong><strong>silenced. </strong>The spat with Fauci comes a day after Twitter took down <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/scott-atlas-twitter-removal-false-coronavirus-tweet" class="u-underline">a tweet by the president&#8217;s controversial coronavirus adviser, Scott Atlas</a>, in which he falsely suggested masks were ineffective. Twitter said the post violated its policy on Covid-19 misinformation.</p></li>

<p>The US supreme court has rejected a Republican plea to limit mail-in voting in Pennsylvania: a potentially crucial ruling that will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/20/us-supreme-court-denies-republican-bid-to-limit-pennsylvania-mail-in-voting" class="u-underline">allow officials to keep counting mail-in ballots in the key swing state</a> after election day, as long as they are postmarked by 3 November and received up to three days later.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court&#8217;s three liberal justices in the ruling, producing a 4-4 deadlock &#8211; but raising concerns about how the court might rule on such cases in future, assuming Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed as its sixth conservative justice.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A ballot drop-box was set ablaze in Los Angeles</strong>, damaging some voters&#8217; mail-in ballots in what the LA county supervisor said appeared to be a deliberate case of arson, with &#8220;all the signs of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/la-drop-box-fire-ballots-damaged-suspected-arson-attack" class="u-underline">an attempt to disenfranchise voters</a> and call into question the security of our elections&#8221;.</p></li>

<p>With the battle for control of the US senate looking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/us-senate-elections-key-races" class="u-underline">even closer than the presidential race</a>, some Republican senators believe boasting about their closeness to Trump is the best way to win re-election, while others attempt to distance themselves from a divisive president:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In Georgia, Senator Kelly Loeffler</strong> has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/georgia-special-election-debate-kelly-loeffler-qanon" class="u-underline">embraced a QAnon-promoting congressional candidate</a> as she tries to outpace rival fellow Republican Doug Collins in their race to the right. Both candidates are also competing with Democrat Raphael Warnock in a three-way contest for Loeffler&#8217;s seat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Texas Senator John Cornyn </strong>has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/republican-senator-john-cornyn-donald-trump" class="u-underline">compared his relationship with Trump to a marriage</a>, in which Cornyn was &#8220;like a lot of women who get married and think they&#8217;re going to change their spouse, and that doesn&#8217;t usually work out very well&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ben Sasse of Nebraska </strong>criticised Trump on a call with constituents, saying he had &#8220;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/17/donald-trump-ben-sasse-senate-republican-bloodbath" class="u-underline">never been on the Trump train</a>&#8221;. The president hit back on Twitter, calling Sass &#8220;stupid&#8221;, &#8220;obnoxious&#8221; and &#8220;the least effective of our 53 Republican senators&#8221;.</p></li>

 </p>
<p>The GOP&#8217;s ballot depositories don&#8217;t threaten election security any more than Democrats&#8217; door-to-door operations. Both entail voters entrusting their ballots to third parties. Why are Democratic and union canvassers more trustworthy than churches and gun shops?</p>

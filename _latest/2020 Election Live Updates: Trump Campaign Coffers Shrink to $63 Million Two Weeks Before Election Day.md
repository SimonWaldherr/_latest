Biden Jr. in the final stretch of the campaign.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">New filings with the Federal Election Commission showed the extent of Mr. Trump&#8217;s cash troubles, which caused the president to fly to California last Sunday for a fund-raiser with just over two weeks until Election Day. The president ended September with just over half as much money as he had at the beginning of the month.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign and its shared committees with the Republican National Committee have raised $1.5 billion since the start of 2019, the disclosures late Tuesday showed that his main re-election committee had only a small slice remaining. That account must pay for many of the race&#8217;s most important costs, including television ads.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">All told, Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign and its shared committees with the R.N.C. had $251.4 million entering October, compared to Mr. Biden&#8217;s campaign and its joint committees with the Democratic National Committee, which had $432 million in the bank.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The Trump campaign has all the resources we need going into the homestretch of this election,&#8221; said Samantha Zager, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She added, &#8220;As Hillary Clinton proved when she outspent us 2-to-1 in 2016, no amount of money can buy the presidency.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden&#8217;s campaign committee had not yet filed its full September report but he entered the month with $180 million cash on hand in that account compared to Mr. Trump&#8217;s $121 million and the president&#8217;s $900,000 in debts at the start of September.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Yikes,&#8221; wrote Rufus Gifford, one of Mr. Biden&#8217;s deputy campaign managers who oversees fund-raising, when Mr. Trump&#8217;s cash-on-hand haul became public. He added, &#8220;Remember when Trump said he would fund his own campaign if he needed to? Well&#8230; He needs to.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign has been seeking to trim costs for more than two months, since Bill Stepien replaced Brad Parscale as campaign manager.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Under Mr. Parscale, the campaign spent heavily as it invested in constructing a massive database of email addresses and phone numbers to reach supporters and ask for money. But as the election as neared, hopeful projections for a massive uptick in contributions have not materialized.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Also on Tuesday, the R.N.C. announced that it entered October with $78.1 million cash on hand, after it spent $36 million more than it had raised in September in its effort to boost Mr. Trump in the final months of the election.</p><p class="css-18tg7ay etfikam0">Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shane-goldmacher" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="the-first-day-of-early-voting-drew-milwaukee-voters-out-on-an-unseasonably-cool-day"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#the-first-day-of-early-voting-drew-milwaukee-voters-out-on-an-unseasonably-cool-day">The first day of early voting drew Milwaukee voters out on an unseasonably cool day.</a></h2><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</p><p class="css-mm3pwi"></p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20elections-briefing-WI/20elections-briefing-WI-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"><p></p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Residents faced lengthy wait times to cast a ballot for early, in-person voting on Tuesday in Wisconsin, Tennessee and Georgia.</p><p class="css-cch8ym"><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Lauren Justice for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">MILWAUKEE &#8212; Despite the unseasonably cool 35-degree temperature, lines were already snaking around two sides of the Frank P. Zeidler Municipal Building in downtown Milwaukee by 7:30 a.m., as crowds waited for more than two hours to cast their ballots on the first day of early voting in Wisconsin.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Jon Berlin, 70, a psychiatrist, arrived with his partner, Susan Hrlevich, 60, at 5:20 a.m. The pair, who are independent voters, wore parkas and brought folding canvas chairs as they walked from their downtown residence to cast votes for Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">They said they feared even longer lines &#8212; and exposure to the coronavirus &#8212; if they had waited until Nov. 3 to vote.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel safe in this country for the first time,&#8221; said Mr. Berlin. &#8220;We have this horrible pandemic and we need a leader who can face the truth and tell the truth.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Early voting has drawn crowds around the nation, and both campaigns are seeking to turn out their supporters. Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden&#8217;s running mate, planned to participate in a virtual Milwaukee rally with Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and several local officials to encourage early voting there.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Chrystal Gillon-Mabry, a 68-year-old artist, and her sister, Coral Hegwood, 59, a retired city employee, brought books to read and chairs when they arrived before 5:30 a.m.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Hegwood said that she was still undecided as she stood in line. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to vote for Trump, but I don&#8217;t want to compromise my Christian beliefs,&#8221; she said. Afterward, she said she had voted for Mr. Biden. &#8220;I prayed and prayed on it,&#8221; she said, concluding that &#8220;Biden has more compassion than Trump &#8212; he has no compassion or empathy for anybody.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Before in-person early voting began Tuesday, more than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://elections.wi.gov/node/7192" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">915,000 Wisconsinites had voted</a> since officials began mailing absentee ballots Sept. 17, a figure that amounts to about 30 percent of the state&#8217;s total vote in 2016. The turnout has been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/us/elections/absentee-voting-in-several-key-states-is-favoring-democrats.html" title="">far higher in the state&#8217;s traditionally Democratic strongholds</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dane County, which includes Madison and is by far the state&#8217;s most Democratic county, has had turnout already that amounts to close to half the votes cast there four years ago. No other county&#8217;s turnout eclipsed more than 37 percent of its 2016 numbers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While Wisconsin Democrats have encouraged voters to cast ballots as soon as they are able, the state&#8217;s Republican Party urged supporters to wait until early voting began. &#8220;Avoid the long lines on Election Day,&#8221; read a flyer the Republican Party of Wisconsin mailed to supporters last week, urging them to make plans to vote early, which the state describes as voting &#8220;absentee&#8221; in person. The mailing made no mention of voting by mail.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Denise Williams, 67, who uses a walker and has been staying mostly at home since the pandemic, was glad to socialize &#8212; from at least a few feet apart &#8212; with fellow voters, all of whom wore masks. She arrived at 6 a.m. and waited almost three hours.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Our country is too divided, I want it back together again,&#8221; said Ms. Williams, a retired nursing assistant who voted for Mr. Biden. She would have voted by mail, she said, but she never received a ballot. &#8220;I wanted to make sure my vote got in, and with my health, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll be on Election Day.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  Kay Nolan and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/reid-j-epstein" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="florida-sees-a-record-early-vote-with-democrats-casting-more-mail-in-ballots-than-republicans"></p><p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70">THE EARLY VOTE</p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#florida-sees-a-record-early-vote-with-democrats-casting-more-mail-in-ballots-than-republicans">Florida sees a record early vote, with Democrats casting more mail-in ballots than Republicans.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="As Florida broke records for early voting, a poll worker collected ballots in Westchester, Fla.&#160;" class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20elections-briefing-florida/merlin_178766826_45b6d120-6623-4df6-a107-19a716d9218b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">As Florida broke records for early voting, a poll worker collected ballots in Westchester, Fla.&#160;</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Saul Martinez for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">When early voting began in Florida on Monday, 366,436 Floridians went to the polls and cast ballots in person, according to data collected <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by the United States Elections Project.</a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The total eclipsed the record set on the first day of early, in-person voting four years ago, when about 291,000 people cast ballots,<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article246505920.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> according to The Miami Herald.</a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Including mailed-in ballots, more than three million people have now voted so far this year in Florida.

McDonald</a>, a professor of political science at the University of Florida, shows that registered Democrats in Florida have been far more likely to vote by mail than Republicans, suggesting that President Trump&#8217;s frequent broadsides against voting by mail may have resonated with Republicans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This is a dynamic we&#8217;re seeing elsewhere, too,&#8221; Dr. McDonald said in an interview.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Republicans nearly tied Democrats when it came to casting ballots in person on the first day of early voting.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Here is what <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/FL.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Florida data</a> reported:</p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">3,033,702 Floridians have already voted.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Turnout is already 31.7 percent of what it was in the entire 2016 election.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">366,436<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>people had voted in person, including 154,004 Democrats and 153,743 Republicans.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">2,667,266 people had voted by mail, including 1,293,994 Democrats and 812,363 Republicans.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Democrats have requested 802,576 more mail-in ballots than Republicans.</p></li></ul><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-cooper" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-lesley-stahl-60-minutes"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-lesley-stahl-60-minutes">Trump cuts a &#8216;60 Minutes&#8217; interview short, and then taunts Lesley Stahl on Twitter.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Lesley Stahl of &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; in a CBS promotion of her coming interviews with President Trump and Joseph R.

Hours later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he was considering posting the interview with Ms. Stahl &#8220;PRIOR TO AIRTIME!&#8221; He described it as a &#8220;terrible Electoral Intrusion&#8221; and suggested that his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., had been treated less harshly by journalistic interlocutors.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also posted <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1318644698341408769?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a six-second video clip</a> of Ms. Stahl at the White House, writing: &#8220;Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me. Much more to come.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In fact, Ms. Stahl had worn a mask at the White House up until the start of her taping with Mr. Trump, including when she first greeted the president, according to a person familiar with the interview. The video posted by Mr. Trump showed Ms. Stahl immediately after the interview ended, as she conferred with two CBS producers, both wearing masks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The CBS crew was tested for the coronavirus before entering the White House on Tuesday, the person said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Stahl has interviewed Mr. Trump twice since the 2016 election, including his first televised interview after winning the presidency. She also filmed with Mr. Trump at the White House <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-full-interview-60-minutes-transcript-lesley-stahl-2018-10-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in October 2018</a>.

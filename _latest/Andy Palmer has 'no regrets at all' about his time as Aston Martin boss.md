<div><p>When Aston Martin listed on the stock market two years ago, then chief executive Andy Palmer summed up his philosophy to investors: &#8220;We don&#8217;t make cars, we make dreams&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>That dream, which included a strategy based on a string of new models, quickly turned into a nightmare for everyone involved.&#160;Sales fell, the shares tanked, questions were raised about hefty fees paid to bankers for the float, fresh debt was raised at eye-watering levels, and new equity eventually had to be injected to save the business.&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/30/andy-palmer-vanquished-bond-carmaker-aston-martin/">Palmer was ousted in May</a>, having spent the previous year and a half under fire from investors and the press about what had gone wrong as news from the luxury car maker, 007&#8217;s marque of choice, went from bad to worse.&#160;</p>
<p>Speaking with the Telegraph as he re-enters the automotive world as vice-chairman of battery developer InoBat after five months out of the limelight, Palmer is quick to recall a previous encounter with this newspaper. &#8220;You asked me when I was going to have had some good news to announce,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Well, this is it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Palmer seems a changed man: energetic, less combative and sunnier in outlook. Perhaps his escape from Aston, and the extra time that lockdown provided,&#160;has changed the man who once listed his hobbies as &#8220;listening to punk rock and running by necessity&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, the last 18 months aged me,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Since then I&#8217;ve lost 14kg and managed to turn around my diabetes. So coronavirus somehow saved my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>He won&#8217;t be drawn on his experiences at Aston, which he joined from Nissan in 2014, claiming he &#8220;has no regrets at all&#8221; about his time there.&#160;&#8220;[My] conscience is clear. I sleep at night.&#8221;</p>

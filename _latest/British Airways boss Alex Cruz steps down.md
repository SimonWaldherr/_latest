The chief executive of British Airways Alex Cruz has stepped down with immediate effect after a turbulent four years in the role.

Mr Cruz will be replaced by Sean Doyle, the boss of IAG stablemate Aer Lingus, but will remain on the airline's board as non-executive chairman.

The Spanish businessman ran IAG's most profitable airline during a testing period for the carrier, which involved having to navigate threats from Brexit, industrial action and the Covid-19 pandemic.

He become embroiled in the first pilot strike in BA history last year. The dispute grounded more than 1,700 flights over two days and cost the airline close to £125m.

He also presided over years of IT problems, which sparked periodic cancellations and delays.

IAG chief executive Luis Gallego said: "I want to thank Alex for all that he has done at British Airways. He worked tirelessly to modernise the airline in the years leading up to the celebration of its 100th anniversary.

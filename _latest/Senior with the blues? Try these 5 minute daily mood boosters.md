<div><p>For many older people, these times can be trying, to say the least. The good news? You can reap mental health benefits in just a few minutes. &#8220;Little things, like watering a plant, laughing or dancing, can take you away from gloomy thoughts and show you that you do have some control over your mood and that life will get better,&#8221; said psychiatrist <a href="http://drcarole.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carole Lieberman</a>. Here, experts break down how to raise your spirits in five minutes flat.</p>
<h2>Try a grounding practice</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;Many older adults have spent the majority of their lives caring for others. Implementing self-care techniques can feel foreign and uncomfortable. Even prior to COVID-19, many older adults struggled with isolation and loneliness,&#8221; commented Dr. Kendra Kubala, PsyD, a licensed psychologist in private practice in NY and PA. That&#8217;s why carving out even just five minutes to do something just for you is so key.</p>
<p>If meditation apps are not all that appealing, Kubala recommends engaging in a mindfulness activity, specifically a &#8220;grounding&#8221; technique, such as holding a cool washcloth to your face and neck, submerging your hands in water, or purposefully focusing on your body&#8217;s sense of smell, touch, sound, sight or taste, sometimes referred to as the &#8220;5-4-3-2-1&#8221; technique since you scan through all five senses.</p>
<p>&#8220;While grounding techniques are often used to alleviate feelings of anxiety or those associated with PTSD, they can be implemented simply to improve focus and decrease unwanted feelings.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Get outside</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;Walking is so simple yet so effective when it comes to senior health, mentally and physically. Exposure to fresh air and natural light triggers endorphins making you feel happier, energized and more positive,&#8221; said John Fawkes, NSCA-certified personal trainer and managing editor of wellness web site <a href="http://the-unwinder.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Unwinder.</a> &#8220;The best part is you don&#8217;t need to have expedition-like walks to get these benefits. Just a few minutes around the block is enough to release endorphins,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If you can, try to take a stroll during the morning or afternoon. That&#8217;s because &#8220;the daylight helps, because the exposure to light is necessary to produce vitamin D3, a vitamin particularly essential for our bones,&#8221; said Dr. Lina Velikova, medical advisor for <a href="http://supplements101.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supplements 101.</a> &#8220;Even when it&#8217;s a cloudy day, exposure to daylight improves the mood, immune system and cognitive abilities.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Write a card</h2>
 
<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like the feeling of receiving an unexpected postcard or letter from someone you love. Even better? Giving that rush of good emotion to others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find some of your old photos [make copies or snap a photo of them] and write some anecdotes on their backs, or craft unique cards or write simple notes and send them to your friends and family,&#8221; suggested Velikova. &#8220;Knowing that you&#8217;ll make someone&#8217;s day better brings great joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can also try <a href="http://postable.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Postable</a> which mails personalized cards. Their &#8220;social distancing&#8221; collection with greetings like &#8220;sorry coronavirus ruined your&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;sending you a socially-distanced hug&#8221; brings the LOLs.</p>
<h2>Reminisce</h2>
 
<p>Speaking of remembering feel-good anecdotes, <a href="http://taraswart.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Tara Swart </a>, neuroscientist and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Source-Open-Your-Mind-Change/dp/1785042009?tag=nypost-20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;The Source: Open Your Mind, Change Your Life&#8221;</a> (Vermilion) is a big fan of the <a href="https://www.ellenlanger.com/books/1/counterclockwise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research by Professor Ellen Langer at Harvard</a> and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Counterclockwise-Mindful-Health-Power-Possibility/dp/1501265288?tag=nypost-20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;Counterclockwise&#8221;</a> (Ballantine Books.) &#8220;Her findings showed that people in their late 70s or 80s who lived as though they were 20 years younger by reminiscing about their lives 20 years ago (what they were doing, who was president) and looked at photos of their younger selves, showed improvements in visual acuity, memory, musculoskeletal strength and even height after just one week,&#8221; said Swart. &#8220;Before and after photos were rated by other people as looking younger after just one week of this way of thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>To apply these takeaways to your daily life, Swart advises reminiscing for one to 5 minutes on a daily basis and journaling both your reminiscences and also the emotions it brought up for you. You could add a numerical scale for your mood, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reminiscing, looking at old photos, having a chat with a friend you have known for decades, all prime the brain for youthfulness and this has an impact on the neurotransmitters and hormones in your brain and body,&#8221; said Swart. &#8220;Writing it down afterwards not only cements the effect but can be something joyful to read over and track how this boosts you.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Play that old time rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll</h2>
 
<p>Just take those old records off the shelf, or throw on a CD, or cue up <a href="http://Spotify.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a> and you&#8217;re in business. &#8220;Putting on music &#8212;preferably nostalgic dance tunes &#8212; and dancing up a storm in your living room works wonders for the soul,&#8221; commented Lieberman. &#8220;Not only is this good to get the blood flowing, but it reminds you of carefree times from the past.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Laugh it up</h2>
 
<p>It&#8217;s no joke that a hearty chuckle can help uplift. &#8220;A great way for seniors to boost their mood is to indulge in 5 minutes or more of laughter,&#8221; said Lieberman. &#8220;Try turning on a sitcom, watching a few funny <a href="http://YouTube.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube </a>videos or looking up jokes on the Internet.&#8221;</p>

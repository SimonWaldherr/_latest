  Six Russian intelligence operatives charged in global hacking operation; same group linked to 2016 election 
description: > 
  Six Russian intelligence officers have been charged in a global computer hacking operation that targeted at least three countries and the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.Federal authorities said the Russian operatives were associated with the same group, known as the "Sandworm" team of military unit 74455, that was linked to Russia's campaign to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.Although Russia had long been suspected in the attacks outlined by prosecutors, Demers said the government's action was not timed to coincide with the upcoming U.S. election.During the past four years, federal officials said, the Russian hacking team inflicted massive damage, from power-outages in Ukraine to business disruptions in western Pennsylvania."Rather than express remorse for the damage they inflicted against victims worldwide, the conspirators callously celebrated their success," Demers said.

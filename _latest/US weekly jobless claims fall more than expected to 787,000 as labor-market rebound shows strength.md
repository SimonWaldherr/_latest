<p>More than 65 million unemployment insurance filings have been made since March, handily surpassing the 37 million seen during the 18-month Great Recession. Thursday's reading also far exceeds the 665,000 filings made during the Great Recession's worst week.</p><p>Still, the reading is the lowest seen since the coronavirus crisis began and marks the first time claims sank below 800,000.</p><p>Jobless claims unexpectedly jumped last week after steadily declining, suggesting the labor market's rebound had run out of steam. Filings had wavered around 850,000 for months as hiring failed to accelerate. The unemployment rate stands at 7.9%, a similarly elevated level after five straight months of improvement.</p><p>While the labor market's recovery has slowed to a sluggish pace, other indicators point to a robust economic bounce-back. Retail spending climbed 1.9% in September, beating estimates and signaling improved consumer spending trends heading into the critical holiday season. The housing market continues to rally on historic demand, and purchasing managers' indexes show continued strength in both the manufacturing and service industries.</p>

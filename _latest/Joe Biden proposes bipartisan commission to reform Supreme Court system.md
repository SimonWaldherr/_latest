<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more.</p><p>Joe Biden wants to appoint a bipartisan commission to reform the Supreme Court system because it&#8217;s &#8220;getting out of whack,&#8221; the Democratic presidential nominee said in a new interview.</p>
<p>The former veep pushed the proposal <a href="https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1319234605342445569" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview with &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221;</a> that&#8217;s set to air in full on Sunday &#8212; nine days before the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;If elected, what I will do is I&#8217;ll put together a national commission of &#8211; bipartisan commission of scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, liberal, conservative,&#8221; Biden said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I will ask them to over 180 days come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it&#8217;s getting out of whack &#8211; the way in which it&#8217;s being handled and it&#8217;s not about court packing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;There&#8217;s a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I&#8217;ve looked to see what recommendations that commission might make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/joe-biden-still-wont-answer-on-court-packing-depends-on-how-it-turns-out/">has dodged questions</a> on court packing as Republicans look to approve the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/amy-coney-barrett-meets-with-senators-on-capitol-hill/">appointment of Amy Coney Barrett</a> to the Supreme Court &#8212; though has said <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/13/joe-biden-says-he-is-not-a-fan-of-court-packing/">he&#8217;s &#8220;not a fan&#8221; of it</a>.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want,&#8221; he told &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.&#8221;</p>

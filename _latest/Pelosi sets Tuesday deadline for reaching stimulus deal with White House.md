description: > 
  Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke for 75 minutes on Saturday and agreed to speak again on Monday.The White House and Pelosi appeared to be at odds more over the substance of the package and not the dollar amount.“Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything because she wants to bail out poorly run Democrat states,” Trump said in the interview.Even if they did, Senate Republicans have indicated strong opposition to the level of spending Pelosi and Mnuchin are discussing.McConnell said Saturday that if Pelosi and Mnuchin do reach a deal, “the Senate would of course consider it,” though it’s unclear precisely what that means.

<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Pelosi&#8217;s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/15/trump-stimulus-economy-congress/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5" target="_blank">on-again-off-again talks with Mnuchin</a> over a deal costing between $1.8 trillion and $2.2 trillion have been dragging on for months without producing results. The window for action is narrowing fast. For the first time, Pelosi put a deadline on them, indicating that if no agreement can be struck by Tuesday, it will not be possible to produce a new relief deal by the election. Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke for<a href="https://twitter.com/TreasurySpox/status/1317632214335631360" target="_blank"> 75 minutes</a> on Saturday and agreed to speak again on Monday.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;The 48 only relates to if we want to get it done before the election &#8212; which we do,&#8221; Pelosi said. &#8220;But we&#8217;re saying to them we have to freeze the design on some of these things, are we going with it or not, and what is the language.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Tuesday&#8217;s deadline is exactly two weeks before the Nov. 3 elections.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The White House and Pelosi appeared to be at odds more over the substance of the package and not the dollar amount. In an interview broadcast Saturday with a Milwaukee television station, Trump said he would approve a spending package that was larger than even the $2.2 trillion that Democrats had sought.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;Nancy Pelosi doesn&#8217;t want to approve anything because she wants to bail out poorly run Democrat states,&#8221; Trump said in the interview. &#8220;And we don&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Pelosi has called for more money for states and cities, but Republican local leaders are among those who have asked for more aid, not just Democrats.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Pelosi has not spoken with President Trump in over a year, but reiterated Sunday that she&#8217;s negotiating through his emissaries and there&#8217;s little point in talking directly with the president because he&#8217;s not truthful.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;You want to meet with him, you meet with him,&#8221; she told host George Stephanopoulos. &#8220;As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the speaker of the House must be respected in terms of what the purpose of the meeting is, what the preparation is for and what the likelihood of success would be.&#8221;</p><p class="powa-wrapper"></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Millions remain out of work and in desperate straits. The economic recovery has slowed. A number of House Democrats have pressed Pelosi urgently to make a deal, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/15/pelosi-stimulus-talks-economy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18" target="_blank">Pelosi has made clear she believes she has the leverage</a> in the talks, and she showed no sign Sunday of backing down.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Mnuchin said Thursday he was prepared to accept Pelosi&#8217;s demands for a national strategic testing plan, subject to minor edits. But Pelosi said Sunday those edits turned out to be significant, including changing &#8220;shall&#8221; to &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;requirements&#8221; to &#8220;recommendations&#8221; and &#8220;a plan&#8221; to &#8220;a strategy, not a strategic plan.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">She said these word changes would give the White House too much flexibility to back out of commitments once the law is passed.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;When you say &#8216;may,&#8217; you&#8217;re giving the president a slush fund. He may do this, he may grant, he may withhold,&#8221; Pelosi said. &#8220;When you say &#8216;shall,&#8217; according to &#8230; what the science tells must happen. &#8230; We can open our schools, we can open our businesses.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Testing language is not the only major issue that remains outstanding. Pelosi and Mnuchin also have yet to come to terms on funding for cities and states, child care, tax credits for lower-income Americans, liability protections sought by Republicans and more. They have areas of agreement including aid to airlines and a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks to Americans.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Mnuchin is traveling in the Middle East, which could further complicate prospects for an outcome. A spokesperson for the treasury secretary had no immediate comment on Pelosi&#8217;s remarks.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Reaching agreement by Tuesday seems next to impossible. Even if they did, Senate Republicans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/10/prospects-more-stimulus-checks-covid-relief-fade-latest-offer-trump-draws-opposition-republicans-democrats/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28" target="_blank">have indicated strong opposition</a> to the level of spending Pelosi and Mnuchin are discussing.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Saturday that the Senate will be voting Wednesday on a narrow $500 billion bill, essentially the same legislation Democrats blocked last month. The bill will include money for schools and health care, liability protections, small-business spending and enhanced unemployment insurance that is lower than the $600 weekly that expired July 31. It does not include new relief checks for individuals.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">McConnell said Saturday that if Pelosi and Mnuchin do reach a deal, &#8220;the Senate would of course consider it,&#8221; though it&#8217;s unclear precisely what that means.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><i>Jeff Stein contributed to this report. </i></p></div>

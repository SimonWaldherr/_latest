<p>Under the lockdown, people will only be allowed in and out of Navarre for work, university studies, to care for relatives, or for emergencies. Bars, cafes and restaurants will be closed. Shops will remain open but will need to operate at 40% capacity and close by 9pm.</p>
<p>Although far less strict than the national lockdown of the spring and early summer, Navarre&#8217;s confinement is more stringent than the one imposed on the Madrid region by the central government. </p>
<p>The lockdown in and around the capital, which has been the source of bitter arguments between the central and regional government, is due to expire this Saturday. The regional government is considering the introduction of a curfew.<br></p>

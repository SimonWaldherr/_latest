Megastar Halsey is a platinum selling artist who can now add 'generation leader' to her list of accolades.

On Friday, TIME magazine announced that the 26-year-old hitmaker was one of their '2020 Next Generation Leaders' as she graced the cover of the prestigious magazine.

Branded a 'fearless artist and advocate,' Halsey took to social media to thank the publication for the honor.

Time: Halsey, 26, graces the new cover of Time magazine, as one of nine 'next generation leaders.' The platinum selling hitmaker, has spent much of the pandemic advocating for social and political issues, in lieu of touring and performing

'Supremely honored to appear on the cover of @time. And eternally grateful to bear witness to an incredible generation that amazes me every single day with their unbridled passion for making this world a better place,' she wrote.

The publication said that the artist had found a 'new purpose in activism and advocacy,' which has been highlighted over the past seven months.

With touring barred due to the Coronavirus pandemic, she has taken to the streets, and to social media, to make her voice heard in another way, with Time taking notice.

Inside she said: 'There is no such thing as a perfect activist. Everyone has said something, done something wrong. I fall in between two chairs,' she said, laughing, 'which means sometimes, I end up on the floor.'

For the cover shoot, Halsey donned a dark grey tweed ensemble. The tailored-vest look, which was belted, showed off some of her many tattoos.

She turned her head over her left shoulder, and gave a closed-mouth smile, as she sparkled for the camera.

Vote: Earlier this week, Halsey did an IGTV with Senator Sanders, as they discussed issues from climate to change to taxes, while encouraging her followers to vote

The Grammy nominated singer exuded pride and power, as she stared intently into the camera while wearing her hair in long braids.

Earlier this week, the Graveyard singer chatted with Senator Bernie Sanders on Instagram, as they discussed wealth taxes and climate change.

The initiative, which was posted in two parts to her social media, was just one way that she used her platform to encourage her 21.4M followers, to vote.

Speaking to TIME about the upcoming election, Halsey said, 'You vote for humanity, or you don’t. You vote for a racist or you don’t. That’s the black and white of it to me.'

Over the summer Halsey made headlines, after she was assaulted by tear gas and rubber bullets, while attending a series of Black Lives Matter protests.

Thought leader: The Graveyard singer, also graced the cover of V Magazine for their thought leaders issue, where she sported an affixed 'Vote' graphic

'I went to the first protest not knowing what to expect,' she said.

She continued, 'I came home shot twice with rubber ammunition. That was a real wake up call for me.'

The artist did not back down, however, instead returning the next day with medical supplies, to help other injured protesters.

Halsey, who is mixed-race, also founded the Black Creators Funding Initiative, which awards $10K grants to Black artists.

The artist shared that because she is 'white passing,' she sometimes feels conflicted about her involvement in protests.

Recently, Halsey has been very open about her battle with endometriosis, as she shared this week on social media, that her flare-ups have been really bad.

In 2019, she revealed that the disorder caused her to have, '3 miscarriages, 4 surgeries,' and daily pain.

In addition to being both a singer, and an acclaimed activist, Halsey is also making the jump into acting and producing.

The New Jersey native, will be starring in the tv adaptation of, They Wish They Were Us, with Euphoria star, Sydney Sweeney, 23.

The book-turned-show, which is dubbed The Player’s Table, is about a murder mystery at an elite high-school. Halsey will also be producing for the project.

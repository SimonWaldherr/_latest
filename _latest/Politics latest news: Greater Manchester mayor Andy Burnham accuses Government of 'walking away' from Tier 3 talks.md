<p>Andy Burnham has called on MPs to intervene after talks between the leaders of Greater Manchester and the Government collapsed today.&#160;</p>
<p>The region, which is home to 2.8 million people, is expected to enter Tier 3 as early as tonight but without any clarity over what financial package is being offered to support jobs and businesses.&#160;</p>
<p>The Mayor said the leaders of the 10 boroughs had asked for a &#163;75 million package to last until the end of the year, dropping to &#163;65 million.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Government refused to accept this and and at two o'clock today they walked away,&#8221; Mr Burnham said, stressing that it was Number 10&#8217;s decision to call off talks.&#160;</p>
<p>He would "now look to Parliament to intervene and make a judgement", calling for a "fair financial framework for Tier 3 lockdown".&#160;</p>
<p>Mr Burnham stressed it was not just about the North West, saying "all parts of the country might find themselves in Tier 3 lockdown."</p>
<p>It is understood that all pubs and bars will be shut for 28 days, unless they are serving substantial meals. Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres, and soft play areas will also be forced to close.</p>
<p>It comes after Labour MPs claimed the Government &#8220;hate Greater Manchester&#8221; during fiery Treasury questions with Rishi Sunak.&#160;</p>

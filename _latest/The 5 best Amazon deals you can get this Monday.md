With&#160;claims to churn out yummy, ultra-smooth soft serve using only&#160;frozen fruit,&#160;cooking writer Valerie Stack Li, found the&#160;<a href="https://www.reviewed.com/cooking/features/yonanas-review" target="_blank">hype was&#160;legit</a> and this handy appliance really does deliver. Created by Dole (of le banana fame),&#160;this&#160;Yonanas device&#160;is a&#160;a combination ice cream maker and blender all-in-one. It takes about five minutes after freezing and thawing to make a batch of dessert that can serve two people, and it's great for folks who might have dietary restrictions, as you don't need to use dairy products (most at-home ice cream makers require this). Originally priced at $49.95 on Amazon, you can get it for $45.99 right now, so you'll save about $4. It's slightly cheaper at <a href="https://shop.yonanas.com/products/yonanas-classic" target="_blank">Yonanas</a> ($39.99), but still a great deal at Amazon.</p><p class="p-text"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yonanas-902-Original-Delicious-Alternatives/dp/B005083ECS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=usatdailydeals-20&amp;linkId=e6660fec17a232c576cfd5b7b3cd3964&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Get the Yonanas Soft-Serve Frozen Treat Maker on Amazon for $45.99 (Save $3.96)</strong></a></p><h2 class="presto-h2">2.&#160;Less than $10: This high-sided litter box with more than 6,000 rave reviews</h2><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/19/USAT/c2c99ce5-aee7-4f8c-8426-7bd280c420a2-kitty1.jpg?width=580&amp;height=326&amp;fit=bounds&amp;auto=webp" alt="This high-sided litter box is great for cats that struggle with traditional litter boxes." width="580"><p>This high-sided litter box is great for cats that struggle with traditional litter boxes.&#160;(Photo: Amazon)</p><p class="clearfix"></p><p class="p-text">With more than 6,000 positive reviews on Amazon, this&#160;4.6-star rated&#160;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Miracle-High-Sided-Litter-inches/dp/B0087Y5NKS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=usatdailydeals-20&amp;linkId=cc543c279044cdd383c662e2a911177d&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank">Nature's Miracle high-sided litter box </a>is one of the most popular options you can buy on the site.

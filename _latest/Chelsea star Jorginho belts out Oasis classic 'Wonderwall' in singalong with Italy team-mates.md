Italy have found a new star to help entertain them while away on international duty - Chelsea's singing sensation Jorginho.

The little Brazilian-born midfielder has been filmed belting out the Oasis classic 'Wonderwall' - a song popular with many Premier League players - as his Azzurri team-mates attempt to join in with him at a team dinner.

The 28-year-old also shows he's a dab hand on the guitar as he strums along with a few choice chords, much to the amusement of his team-mates, including veteran defender Giorgio Chiellini.

Jorginho revealed recently that he started playing his guitar again during the early days of the coronavirus outbreak when in London.

The former Verona and Napoli playmaker said he began strumming to ward off boredom as he and his Chelsea team-mates went into lockdown.

'You have to find something else to do to keep yourself busy. I, for instance, have assembled my bicycle, and I got my guitar again to play and practice,' he told the Chelsea website in May.

‘The worst part is that I can more or less play but the singing just doesn’t come off.'

Maybe no Liam Gallagher then, but Jorginho's Italy pals looked happy enough as he cranked out the Oasis anthem, with even veteran defensive enforcer Chiellini hitting some decent notes.

Jorginho was rested as Italy hammered Moldova 6-0 in Wednesday's friendly in Florence as Roberto Mancini's side extended their unbeaten run to 17 games.

The Azzurri face Poland in Group One of the Nations League on Sunday before hosting Holland in Bergamo on October 14.

Italy currently top the group with four points from their two matches, while Poland are third, having claimed three points from their opening two games.

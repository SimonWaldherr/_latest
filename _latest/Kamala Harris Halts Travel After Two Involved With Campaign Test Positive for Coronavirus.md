Vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris has canceled the next several days of travel after a staffer and another person with whom she traveled tested positive for the coronavirus, the Biden campaign announced Thursday.

Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said Liz Allen, Harris' communications director, and a non-staff flight crew member had tested positive for COVID-19. The campaign learned of the positive tests late on Wednesday night, according to O'Malley Dillon.

Harris most recently tested negative for COVID-19 on Wednesday, according to the campaign. Harris later said on Twitter that she is not showing any symptoms and "will be transparent" about her upcoming test results.

O'Malley Dillon said Harris' travel has been canceled through Sunday but noted that the vice presidential nominee was not required to quarantine because she was not in "close contact" with either individual during the two days prior to their positive test results, under definitions by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both individuals were on a flight with Harris on Oct. 8, but all three wore N95 masks and the senator "was not within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes with either of them," according to O'Malley Dillon.

Harris will resume in-person campaign activities on Monday. The campaign said that neither of the individuals who tested positive for the virus had contact with Biden or any other campaign staffers since testing positive or in the 48 hours prior to testing positive. Biden's schedule was not altered.

In disclosing the developments, the campaign seemed to be deliberately drawing a distinction with President Donald Trump , whose handling of the pandemic in general has been among his biggest political liabilities as he seeks reelection and who contracted the virus himself and was criticized for a lack of transparency regarding his diagnosis and his treatment.

First lady Melania Trump, the president's son Barron and several administration staffers have also tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, but the campaign has largely continued with a vigorous schedule of in-person appearances since Trump was released from the hospital. The Trump administration reportedly decided not to trace contacts after a Rose Garden announcement of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court became what noted epidemiologist Anthony Fauci described last week as a superspreader event .

The Biden campaign emphasized that travel restrictions were taken out of an abundance of caution, and its statement was marked by details about times and testing results not only of Harris but of those around her.

Campaign officials volunteered that they had also canceled Thursday's travel plans for Douglas Emhoff, Harris' husband. Emhoff was scheduled to travel to Minnesota on Thursday with former second lady Jill Biden. O'Malley Dillon said in the statement that he will resume in-person campaigning on Friday, when he is scheduled to travel to Iowa.

"This is the sort of conduct we have continuously modeled in this campaign," O'Malley Dillon said. "From the outset of this pandemic, the Biden-Harris campaign has taken every precaution to limit the spread of COVID-19. Today's exceedingly cautious steps are part of that commitment."

O'Malley Dillon noted in her statement that the Biden campaign has begun the contact tracing process.

  Older workers face higher unemployment than midcareer peers

  Older workers face higher unemployment than midcareer peers Older workers are facing higher unemployment than midcareer workers during the pandemic, according to a study released Tuesday from the New SchoolFor the first time in nearly 50 years, older workers are facing higher unemployment than midcareer workers, according to a study released Tuesday from the New School.In every recession since the 1970s, older workers had persistently lower unemployment rates than mid-career workers, partly because of the benefits of seniority.In the current recession, however, older workers experienced higher unemployment rates than midcareer workers in each month since the onset of the pandemic.The older workers' unemployment rates from April through September were 1.1 percentage points higher than mid-career workersâ€™, at 9.7% versus 8.6%, looking at six-month rolling average.Older workers often face age discrimination, making it difficult to find a job.

<div><p>Mr Trump is expected to steer the debate into highly personal territory for Mr Biden by bringing up the candidate's son,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/16/fbi-investigating-whether-hunter-biden-emails-linked-foreign/"> Hunter Biden, and his business dealings in Ukraine, China</a> and other countries during his father's time in the White House.&#160;</p>
<p>It comes after the New York Post published emails allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden which the newspaper said it was given by Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's personal lawyer. The New York Post article claimed that Mr Biden senior, while serving as the US vice president, met with an official at Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm his son Hunter worked for. Mr Biden's campaign has denied the report, insisting that he did not meet with the Ukrainian.&#160;</p>
<p>The article also included personal photographs purported to come from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden.&#160;</p>
<h3>Foreign policy</h3>
<p>The 90-minute debate will be divided into 15-minute segments on these topics: fighting Covid-19, American families, race in America, climate change, national security, and leadership. Mr Trump's team are angered by the omission of foreign-policy from the topics, which is an area they feel the president can shine.&#160;</p>
<p>Mr Trump is still likely to seize any moment available to highlight his foreign policy "wins", including overseeing the peace agreements between Israel and two of its neighbours in the region, retaking ground from Isil in Syria and Iraq, assassinating a top Iranian general and withdrawing US troops from the Middle East.</p>
<h3>Will anything actually be said to sway undecideds?</h3>
<p>Pollsters believe that more Americans have made up their minds than in previous years, with one <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/21/us-election-polls-2020-tracker-who-win-donald-trump-joe-biden/">recent poll showing</a> just 3 per cent of voters remained undecided on who to vote for. With the US deeply politicised and voters so locked into their views, will tonight's debate actually shift anyone's opinion?</p>
<p>Despite Mr Biden's lead in national polls, the Democrat is likely to use his time on stage to urge supporters against complacency. The 77-year-old is aware of the perils of being ahead in the polls, and wants voters to remember the lessons of 2016 and not take his seeming lead in the race for granted.&#160;</p>
<p>Mr Trump will need to use this opportunity to speak directly to American voters who are wavering in their support for the Republican president. In particular, Mr Trump needs to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/20/dispatch-rural-voters-gather-trump-house-pennsylvania-president/">woo the groups that helped secure his victory in 2-16 - namely suburban women</a> and white working class men.</p>

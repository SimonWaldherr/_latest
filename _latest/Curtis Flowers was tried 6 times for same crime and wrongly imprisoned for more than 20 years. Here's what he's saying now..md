Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man who was tried six times for the same crime, gave his first interview since his murder charges were dropped to a reporter whose investigative podcast helped set him free.

Flowers recently spoke at length with Madeleine Baran, host and lead reporter of American Public Media's podcast "In the Dark," about his life and the legal saga that resulted in his imprisonment for more than 20 years.

"In the Dark" will drop the full interview in an episode on Wednesday.

"I used to hear guys talk who’d been there 20, 30-some years on death row," Flowers told Baran. "I hear one guy say, 'It’s not being executed and killed, what bothers me. It’s the anticipation of it because you never know when.'

"Hearing things like that, you know, it just showed me how some people just give up. And I just never stopped fighting," Flowers said.

"In the Dark" began investigating Flowers' case in 2017 and continued to cover major developments through this year.

“Up until now, we’ve been missing the voice of the central figure in this story,” Baran said in a statement. “It was incredible to speak face-to-face with the person whose case we know so well, but whose own perspective we haven’t been able to share until now. We look forward to sharing Curtis’ own story with the In the Dark listeners who have followed this story along with us.”

Curtis Flowers' story, in his own words

American Public Media shared segments of the interview before the Wednesday release of the full conversation with Flowers. Here's Flowers' story, shared in his own words.

On his arrest:

"I remember police showing up at the door, there was three of them. He said, 'Sorry to bother you, I'm looking for Curtis Flowers.' I said, 'That’s me.' Next thing I know I'm against the wall. He told me, 'We have a warrant for your arrest back in Mississippi.' And I said, 'For what?' And he told me and I said, 'Oh that can’t be me.'"

When the jury announced the death penalty:

"It was like having the air sucked out of you, you know. You can’t breathe. I remember one of the deputies said, 'Your mom want to speak with you.' And she told me, 'Keep your head up and don’t give up. I know it’s a lie, you know it’s a lie. Don’t give up.'"

Is there anything you’d want to say to (District Attorney) Doug Evans?

"No, no I wouldn’t. Some things you don’t – just don’t need to be said, you know? What’s understood is understood. I feel that Doug was wrong. He knew he was wrong. But as far as a conversation, no."

What happened in Curtis Flowers' case?

In 1996, four people were shot, execution-style, at Tardy Furniture in Winona. Flowers, who had briefly worked at the furniture store, was accused of the murders.

Over about two decades, the white prosecutor, Evans, tried Flowers, a Black man, an unprecedented six times for the murders, but could not get a guilty verdict to stick. Two of Flowers' trials ended with hung juries. The other four trials resulted in convictions which were later overturned by higher courts due to prosecutorial misconduct, including racial discrimination during jury selection.

Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Flowers' 2010 conviction because justices found that Evans had deliberately excluded Black people from the jury.

Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch dropped the case against Flowers in September, ensuring that Flowers would not be tried a seventh time.

Samara Freemark, managing producer of In the Dark, said in a statement: “When we started covering this story, we could not have predicted that our reporting would have such an impact. It’s been a remarkable experience to discover the depth of this story and how it speaks to larger systemic issues in our justice system.”

<div><p>ABU DHABI &#8211; UFC president Dana White has made it clear the UFC will visit Abu Dhabi frequently for the foreseeable future, and local reps seem just fine with the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Return to UFC Fight Island&#8221; associate project manager Nour Al Harmoodi told MMA Junkie that while the UFC&#8217;s visits require extensive operational logistics, the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism remains committed to creating a safe environment for the promotion as long as necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;It demonstrates, really, Abu Dhabi&#8217;s readiness and capabilities to host such world-class sporting events and tourism events, in general,&#8221; Al Harmoodi said. &#8220;It has that infrastructure, it has that build, it has that manpower to host such a spectacle of an event, so we&#8217;ve taken such great measures to be able to make this happen, from health and safety procedures and protocols, following both government and private entities that are making this happen &#8211; working very hard and diligently to make this happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to tell the world that, &#8216;Hey, Abu Dhabi is ready for you to come here.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s blockbuster UFC 254, which features a lightweight title unification bout between reigning champion Khabib Nurmagomedov (28-0 MMA, 12-0 UFC) and interim titleholder Justin Gaethje (22-2 MMA, 5-2 UFC) marks the UFC&#8217;s ninth fight card in a 15-week span in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>The events have taken place during a three-week run in July, as well as the current five-week stretch that began in September.</p>
<p>But as <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/07/ufc-fight-island-updates-behind-the-scenes-from-abu-dhabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MMA Junkie has extensively covered</a>, the cards aren&#8217;t as simple as just booking a venue but instead require extensive planning and preparation to create a safe zone, or &#8220;bubble,&#8221; as part of the UFC&#8217;s ongoing response to keeping athletes and staff safe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But Al Harmoodi said the Abu Dhabi government sees real value in their ongoing investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to hosting UFC again and again,&#8221; Al Harmoodi said. &#8220;We are happy for the UFC to call Abu Dhabi its fighting capital of the world.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>White has repeatedly admitted he&#8217;s struggling in the current climate to predict what his business will do on a week-to-week basis, much less months in advance. However, it seems almost certain the promotion will be back on &#8220;Fight Island&#8221; early in 2021.</p>
<p>White has hinted that by that time, he thinks fans might be able to share a UFC venue for the first time since March. Al Harmoodi admitted she also can&#8217;t predict the future but said there will be a new venue available to the promotion, rather than the current Flash Forum that has served as host to the first two &#8220;Fight Island&#8221; runs.</p>
<p>The brand new 18,000-seat Etihad Arena is nearing completion on Yas Island, and Al Harmoodi believes it will be ready to host the octagon in 2021 &#8211; and maybe fans, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Etihad Arena will be ready for the next time UFC comes back to Abu Dhabi, and we have an agreement with them for the next three years,&#8221; Al Harmoodi said. &#8220;So honestly, we&#8217;re ready. As soon as everything blows over and the world opens again to spectators and an audience and fans and crowds, we&#8217;re hungry for them. We&#8217;re happy to have them back as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>White told MMA Junkie he plans on meeting with with Abu Dhabi leader Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan this week about plans for the future but seemed excited about the prospects. Al Harmoodi displayed equal eagerness for what lies ahead, pandemic or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call (&#8216;Fight Island&#8217;) a brand,&#8221; Al Harmoodi said. &#8220;I&#8217;d call it a legacy. &#8230; Who knows when we might do it another time, but we&#8217;re happy to have the UFC back again. Whether it&#8217;s &#8216;UFC Fight Island&#8217; or Abu Dhabi Showdown Week, we&#8217;re happy to host. This only proves that Abu Dhabi is ready, Abu Dhabi is capable, and Abu Dhabi is really on the lookout to create bigger and better events in the future.&#8221;</p>

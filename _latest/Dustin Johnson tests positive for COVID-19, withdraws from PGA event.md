Dustin Johnson, the No. 1-ranked golfer in the world, has tested positive for COVID-19 and will withdraw from this weekend’s PGA Tour event in Las Vegas, the Tour announced.

The Tour said Johnson, 36, is experiencing symptoms. He notified Tour officials when he began feeling symptoms and was subsequently tested, which revealed the diagnosis that knocked him out of the CJ Cup at Shadow Creek.

“Obviously, I am very disappointed,” Johnson said in a statement. “I was really looking forward to competing this week, but will do everything I can to return as quickly as possible. I have already had a few calls with the TOUR’s medical team and appreciate all the support and guidance they have given me.”

Johnson, the 2016 US Open champion, finished tied for sixth in this year’s Open at Winged Foot after finishing tied for second at the PGA Championship.

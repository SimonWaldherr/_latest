<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A Brazilian volunteer in the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial has died, health officials announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Brazil National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) said it was notified Monday of the participant&#8217;s death and received data from the investigation into the matter.</p>
<p>The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is helping coordinate phase 3 clinical trials in the country, also confirmed the death.</p>
<p>The patient wasn&#8217;t identified, but local media said he was a 28-year-old doctor in Rio de Janeiro who had been on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/voluntario-brasileiro-para-vacina-de-oxford-morre-laboratorio-nao-informa-se-ele-recebeu-imunizante-24704301?utm_source=globo.com&amp;utm_medium=oglobo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brazilian outlet Globo reported</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the volunteer had been among the participants who received the potential vaccine or a placebo.</p>
<p>ANVISA said testing of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca with the University of Oxford in Britain would continue after the volunteer&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>The study previously <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-halts-covid-19-vaccine-trial/">faced a setback in September</a> when one of the participants in the United Kingdom suffered an adverse reaction, prompting the company to temporarily pause the trials.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca didn&#8217;t immediately respond to request for comment.</p>

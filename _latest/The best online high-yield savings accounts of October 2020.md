The best online high-yield savings accounts of October 2020

*As of October 2020, the national average APY on savings accounts is 0.05% according to the FDIC.

Savings rates for the largest US banks

You really can't go wrong with a high-yield savings account. If you've decided to store your money in a high-yield account, where it's growing but still accessible, you're already doing better than the 75% of Americans who are leaving money on the table.

It's important to note that, unlike certificates of deposit (CDs), you do not lock in a fixed interest rate when you open a high-yield savings account. The annual percentage yield (APY) is variable since it's based on what the Federal Reserve does. So while it's smart to look at interest rates when comparing high-yield savings accounts, it's not the be-all and end-all.

Note also that high-yield savings accounts' rates have been decreasing in response to the coronavirus pandemic and struggling economy in 2020. But considering these accounts still offer higher rates than your average brick-and-mortar bank, it's still a good idea to use them to save money.

Below you'll find our picks for the best high-yield savings accounts right now. Each of these accounts is free of monthly maintenance fees, insured by the FDIC, and appropriate for modest and super savers alike. Users can access each of these accounts online or through an app.

Our expert panel for this guide

We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best high-yield savings accounts for your needs. You can read their insights at the bottom of this post.

We're focusing on what will make a high-yield savings account most useful, including high APY, low costs, and more.

Why it stands out: Discover offers a competitive rate, and it's a solid low-fee option — there's no fee for insufficient funds, excess transactions, or monthly maintenance. You also don't need an initial deposit to open an account.

Discover offers 24/7 customer service, both over the phone and online chat.

What to look out for: No out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements. Discover has a large ATM network, and it doesn't charge a fee for using an ATM outside the network. But unlike many banks, it won't reimburse any fees charged by out-of-network ATM providers.

Why it stands out: Ally has been a power player in the high-yield savings space for a few years now, and it consistently nabs top awards for online banking. It's a particular favorite among millennials, who tout its accessibility and ease of use. You can deposit checks through the mobile app and open multiple accounts in minutes.

Ally makes it easy to save for specific goals. Assign each account a nickname, like "Emergency Fund" or "Travel Account" to track your progress and stay motivated. You may decide to open a separate account for each goal, but Ally has a bucket feature that allows you save for multiple goals in one account.

What to look out for: An excess transaction charge. Like most banks, Ally limits the number of transfers in and out of its high-yield savings account to six times per statement cycle. Each transfer over the limit will incur a fee of $10. However, Ally is not charging an excess transaction fee during the coronavirus pandemic.

No monthly service fees Cons Must meet requirements to earn highest APY

No physical branch locations

Why it stands out: Varo pays two rates. The base APY is already higher than what you'll find at most banks, and you can more than double your rate if you meet a few requirements. Varo also doesn't charge monthly fees.

What to look out for: Mandatory activities to earn the highest APY. You must do three things each month to earn the highest APY: Make at least five purchases with your debit card, receive at least $1,000 in direct deposits, and keep an account balance of $10,000 or less.

$10 excess transaction fee

Limited live customer service via phone Read Our Review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right

Why it stands out: This account rewards automatic savings with a high APY. After you make an initial deposit of $100 to open an account, you'll earn the top APY for a brief introductory period. After that, you'll need to set up automatic transfers or direct deposit of at least $100 a month (or keep a balance of $25,000) to keep earning 0.55%. If you're serious about making saving a habit, this is a great tool to get started.

What to look out for: Minimum balance requirements. If you don't set up automatic transfers of $100 a month and you have less than $25,000 in the account, you'll earn the lower APY.

Pros High APY

No monthly service fee Cons Minimum initial deposit of $100

Limited customer service availability

No physical branch locations

$10 excess transaction fee

Why it stands out: Vio offers one of the top savings rates right now, and the bank doesn't charge a monthly service fee. Although it requires an opening deposit, you don't have to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest.

What to look out for: Minimum deposit. You'll need at least $100 to open an account with Vio. Also, bear in mind that interest rates fluctuate with the federal funds rate, which means you aren't necessarily guaranteed to earn the highest rate with this account forever. There are still good reasons to open a high-yield savings account when interest rates are low, but be aware they can change.

Why it stands out: Chime makes it easy for you to automatically save. You can round up debit card purchases to the nearest dollar and move the spare change into your savings account, or set up a percentage of your paycheck to go directly into savings.

What to look out for: Checking account. You must open a Chime Spending Account before opening a Chime Savings Account, because the two frequently work in tandem. If you're looking for a place to open a savings account but not a checking account, then you may prefer another one of our top picks.

Other online high-yield savings accounts we considered and why they didn't make the cut

Frequently asked questions

Why trust our recommendations?

Personal Finance Insider's mission is to help smart people make the best decisions with their money. We understand that "best" is often subjective, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a financial product or account — a high APY, for example — we outline the limitations, too. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of various products so you don't have to.

How did we choose the best online high-yield savings accounts?

There are a lot of high-yield savings accounts out there. Through our research, we've found that the best high-yield savings accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence, robo-advisers, and other internet-only financial companies.

In addition to polling Business Insider employees for their favorite picks, we reviewed high-yield savings accounts at nearly two dozen institutions to identify the strongest options. We also cross-referenced our list against popular comparison sites like Bankrate and Nerdwallet to make sure we didn't miss a thing.

While interest rates are an important aspect of any high-yield savings account, several offer the same annual percentage yield (APY). To differentiate between them, we also considered minimum deposit and balance requirements, transfer limitations, and any other standout features. Importantly, we didn't consider any high-yield savings accounts that impose monthly maintenance fees.

How does a high-yield savings account work?

High-yield savings accounts are typically offered by online-only banks, or by brick-and-mortar banks that offer online-only savings accounts. Banks can typically pay higher rates on these accounts because they don't have to cover expenses that come with physical branch locations.

A high-yield savings account rate is variable, which means it can fluctuate after you've opened the account. Your bank will usually email you to tell you the rate will go up or down soon.

Are online high-yield savings accounts worth it?

Yes — a high-yield savings account has very few downsides, if any. There's no risk that you'll lose money, your account is insured by the FDIC (usually up to $250,000, but up to $1 million in some cases), and it gives you a shot at beating inflation.

The only time a high-yield savings account may not be worth it is if you're paying excessive maintenance fees that eat into your interest payments or you find yourself restricted by the monthly transfer limit or time it takes for your money to get to your checking account.

Which banks have the best savings interest rates?

Generally you'll find the best savings interest rates at online banks. Nationally, the average traditional savings account earns just 0.09% APY. The best high-yield savings accounts offer an APY of at least 1%.

If you're more comfortable banking with a brick-and-mortar, a traditional savings account may be a better option for you. Just know that you may not be getting the best possible interest rate.

How often do high-yield savings rates change?

Interest rates on high-yield savings accounts closely follow the federal funds rate. That is to say, rates are variable and can change multiple times per year at the whim of the Federal Reserve.

The Fed meets eight times a year and decides whether to increase, decrease, or leave interest rates untouched. If the Fed cuts rates, the APY on your savings account can drop within days. When rates are lower, you won't earn as much interest on your savings. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't save at all. When interest rates inevitably go back up, you'll see a greater return on your money than if you started from scratch.

Because the Fed spent several years raising rates since the Great Recession, it cut interest rates three times toward the end of 2019 in an effort to regulate the economy and side step another recession, and it's already slashed rates twice in 2020. It's nearly impossible to predict with certainty which way rates will go, but you can bet they're going to change one way or another.

Is there a 5% interest savings account?

There is no savings account that offers a 5% interest rate. Today, most high-yield savings accounts top out around 1.6% APY. If you want a higher return and you don't need immediate access to your money, you may consider putting it in a certificate of deposit (CD) or investing in the market.

What's the difference between a high-yield savings account and money market account?

A high-yield savings account and money market account are both savings tools that pay competitive rates on your money. The main difference is that money market accounts often make it easier to access your money by sending you paper checks or a debit card.

This can be convenient if you need to access money quickly in an emergency, but easy access might make it more tempting to spend your savings.

See Business Insider's picks for the best money market accounts »

What's the difference between a high-yield savings account and CD?

When you put your money in a high-yield savings account, you should be able to withdraw or transfer funds regularly. The rate is variable, meaning it can change after you open the account.

With a CD, you choose a CD term, probably between one and five years. You put your money in the CD, and you don't withdraw any funds until the term is over. The rate is typically fixed, meaning your APY is locked in from the time you open the account until the term ends.

You can deposit money into your high-yield savings account whenever you want, but most banks only allow you to make one initial deposit when you first set up the CD.

CDs can be good saving tools if you're okay with parting with your money for a while, but if you need access to money sooner, a savings account is probably a better choice.

The experts' advice on choosing the best high-yield savings account for you

To learn more about what makes a good high-yield savings account and how to choose the best fit, four experts weighed in:

Here's what they had to say about high-yield savings. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)

Generally, what makes a high-yield savings account good or not good?

Roger Ma, CFP:

"It might not be as seamless to get your money out of an online savings account as it is a brick-and-mortar, but you don't want to have so much friction where it's such a pain to get the money out when you need it."

Mykail James, CFEI:

"Anything with a fee is not a good high-yield savings account. Anything that restricts how much you can save is, to me, not very good. If I can't save more than $10,000 in this account, and then I have to move it over somewhere else — to me, that's not a really good savings account, because it's not really prepared to help me expand and grow, which is what a savings account is supposed to do. I also look at interest rates, definitely. I look to see when the interest is paid. Is it quarterly, or is it monthly? How often do they pay out interest, and what are the interest rate stipulations?"

How should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD?

Tania Brown, CFP:

"So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and ... the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account."

Laura Grace Tarpley, Personal Finance Insider:

"I would use a high-yield savings account or money market account for short-term goals or an emergency fund. You'll probably want to choose whichever has a higher rate, but money market accounts can be good for emergency savings because they often come with a debit card or paper checks, making it easy to access money quickly. Then use CDs for longer-term goals, like buying a home in a few years."

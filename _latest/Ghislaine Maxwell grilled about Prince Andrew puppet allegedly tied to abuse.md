<div><p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/05/prince-andrew-groped-epstein-victims-with-puppet-of-himself-giuffre/">Prince Andrew puppet</a> that was allegedly used to grope some of Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s victims made a cameo in Ghislaine Maxwell&#8217;s 2016 deposition <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/22/ghislaine-maxwells-deposition-about-sordid-sex-life-unsealed/">that was unsealed Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>The doll &#8212; seemingly the same one that Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre said bore the likeness of the British royal &#8212; was the subject of a lengthy line of questioning in Maxwell&#8217;s seven-hour grill-fest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any puppet you&#8217;ve ever seen in Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s home in the presence of [redacted]?&#8221; asked Giuffre&#8217;s lawyer Sigrid McCawley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, puppet, you know, there is lots of types of puppets,&#8221; Maxwell shot back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any type of puppet,&#8221; McCawley continued. She later asks Maxwell, &#8220;Have you seen any puppet that fits any description in the presence of [redacted] in Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s home?&#8221;</p>
<p>After an objection from her lawyer, Maxwell waffles, &#8220;I am not aware of any small handheld puppet that was there. There was a puppet &#8212; not a puppet &#8212; there was a &#8212; I don&#8217;t know how would you describe it really, I don&#8217;t know how would you describe it. Not a puppet, I don&#8217;t know how you would describe it. A caricature of [redacted] that was in Jeffrey&#8217;s home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many names were redacted in the deposition ahead of it going public on Thursday.</p>
<p>Giuffre claimed Andrew used a puppet to allegedly grope her at Epstein&#8217;s Upper East Side mansion in 2001. Giuffre has said Maxwell was there at the time of the alleged abuse.</p>
<p>Another Epstein accuser, Johanna Sjoberg, had also reportedly accused Andrew of inappropriately touching her with the same puppet.</p>
<p>Maxwell, <a href="https://nypost.com/article/who-is-ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-confidante/">a close pal of Andrew&#8217;s</a>, denied gifting him the doll or witnessing it being used in the alleged abuse of Roberts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you recollect asking Virginia Roberts to sit on [redacted] lap with the caricature of [redacted]?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not recollect that,&#8221; the British socialite replied.</p>
<p>Maxwell is behind bars on charges she recruited and groomed young women to be sexually abused by her and Epstein.</p>
<p>Giuffre has claimed she served as Epstein&#8217;s &#8220;sex slave&#8221; and had sex with his powerful pals, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/07/virginia-giuffre-recalls-alleged-sex-with-prince-andrew-in-memoir/">including Prince Andrew</a> &#8212; a charge he&#8217;s denied.</p>

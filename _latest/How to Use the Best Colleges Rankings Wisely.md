<div><p>The 2021 edition of the U.S. News &amp; World Report <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges">Best Colleges</a> rankings provides an ideal starting point for families comparing colleges. It offers an opportunity to judge the relative quality of the educational experience at schools according to widely accepted indicators of excellence.</p><p>Many other factors, including some that can't be measured, should figure into your decision &#8211; such as the school's cost, the availability of <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college">financial aid</a>, course offerings, activities, the feel of campus life, and the setting and geographic location. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/right-school/tours">College visits</a>, if possible, can prove invaluable, too.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>How should families use the various rankings tables and lists that are on usnews.com? Study the data that accompanies the actual rankings. You should not use the rankings as the sole basis for deciding on one school over another. The rankings are a source of useful information about colleges that is otherwise hard to obtain and will help you <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/right-school/choices">narrow your search</a> to a small number of colleges that are a good fit.</p><p>For instance, high school students can scan the student <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/test-prep">SAT or ACT scores</a> at different institutions to infer whether they could gain admission to a particular college &#8211; and even rise to the top of the applicant pool and possibly qualify for a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/most-merit-aid">merit-based scholarship</a>.</p><p>They can use class size data to get a sense of the intimacy of colleges' classes.&#160;They can also use the acceptance rate to gauge their odds of getting into a given school.</p><p>They can check student-faculty ratios to see how much attention they are likely to receive from professors at different schools or check the freshman retention rates to learn how hard schools work to keep students from dropping out.&#160;They can also study the graduation rates, which are the best indicator of the proportion of freshmen who graduate with a bachelor's degree from the school.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>They can study other lists to see how the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public">public schools</a> stack up against one another, to compare specialty schools, or to see how U.S. News rates campuses in terms of <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/campus-ethnic-diversity">diversity</a> or <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/best-value">best value</a> for the dollar. And students can look up more than 1,800 four-year schools in the U.S. News directory to gather information on schools' location, size, cost, academic offerings and financial aid policies.</p><p>While scanning the U.S. News lists to find colleges that feel right, students and parents may find many institutions that they had not considered &#8211; or even heard of. There are hundreds of fine colleges and universities, and ultimately the challenge is to narrow the list to a few that students would really like to attend.</p><p>The articles and rankings on this site will give students the names of some of those schools and help them think more about which colleges make the most sense for them. Good luck.</p><p><i>Searching for a college? Get our <a href="https://www.usnews.com/usnews/store/college_compass.htm">complete rankings</a> of Best Colleges.</i></p></div>

At least Manchester United's first pay-per-view game offered some value for money as they came from behind to win with a flourish on Tyneside. It was a much-needed reminder of what this team is capable of.

Both sides played their part in a thrilling contest, as did both goalkeepers, but the visitors deserved all three points and they had destroyed Newcastle by the end, the home team exhausted, crushed like a tin can under a boot in the second half.

And it was their second goal that showed us how classy Manchester United can be, the move starting deep inside their own half, Bruno Fernandes eventually finding the top corner after a sublime reverse pass from Marcus Rashford.

It had begun, though, with a lovely cushioned header out of defence from Harry Maguire, who delivered a near faultless display in defence as well as scoring the vital equaliser.

Having turned himself into the centre of attention for all the wrong reasons since his arrest by Greek police while on holiday over the summer, Maguire was given another chance to put things right.

Those that know Maguire were always confident he would want to play on; to put things right in the only way he knows how, the only way he can.

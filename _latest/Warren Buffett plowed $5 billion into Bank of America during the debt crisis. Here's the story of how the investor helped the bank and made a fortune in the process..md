<p>The investor tried to get through to the bank's CEO, Brian Moynihan, but was initially blocked by a call-center worker.</p><p>"Warren asked to speak to me and of course they don't transfer everybody who calls the call centers to the CEO's line," Moynihan told David Rubenstein <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-10-09/how-warren-buffett-got-through-to-bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-video" target="_blank">in a Bloomberg interview last year</a>.</p><p>Buffett eventually got through to Moynihan and proposed an investment in his company. Moynihan replied that Bank of America didn't need the capital.</p><p>"I know, that's why I'm calling," Buffett responded, adding that accepting his money would provide stability, a stamp of approval, and a cash cushion.</p><p>Moynihan concurred, and the pair signed a deal less than 24 hours after speaking for the first time. Buffett's cash hit Bank of America's account a couple of days later. &#13;

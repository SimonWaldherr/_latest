Le’Veon Bell may go from the worst team in the NFL to the best.

Bell’s Jets tenure ended with him liking several tweets suggesting the Jets should trade him and that he should have gotten the ball more in the Jets’ loss to the Cardinals. Bell is dropping some more social media breadcrumbs now that he is a free agent.

Bell liked a video on Twitter from 2019 that featured him and Chiefs star defensive tackle Chris Jones. The video was of Bell and Jones hyping up the possibility of the running back signing with the Chiefs. It came six days before Bell signed his ill-fated four-year, $52 million contract with the Jets that he was released from on Tuesday night. Bell and Patrick Mahomes also just followed each other on Twitter.

According to NFL reporter Benjamin Allbright, Bell is deciding between the Chiefs, Dolphins, Bears, Raiders and Patriots.

The defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs are 4-1 and could use a complement to rookie running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire.

  Borrowers face 'lender lottery' as 323,000 payment freezes end soon 
description: > 
  Banking body UK Finance said financially vulnerable people benefiting from 323,700 payment holidays across mortgages, credit cards and personal loans will be offered help 'tailored to their individual circumstances'.Borrowers whose payment holidays did not show up on their credit report as a missed payment could see their score hit from the start of next month if they have to turn to their lender for further support.James Jones, head of consumer affairs at the reference agency Experian, confirmed new payment deferrals would be visible on credit reports.From November, where borrowers temporarily pause or reduce their regular payments lenders will flag this on their credit report, and detail how long it will last for.This leaves those coming to the end of their payment breaks at the mercy of individual lenders.

Ads will also run in Maine&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District. Maine and Nebraska are the only two states to divide their electoral votes by congressional district. Trump won Maine&#8217;s mostly rural 2nd CD in 2016, and the lastest public opinion polls indicate it&#8217;s neck and neck between the president and<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden"> Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden</a> in the district.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/640/320/AP20293800513779.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="President Donald Trump speaks to reporters at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Monday, Oct. 19, 2020, in Phoenix.

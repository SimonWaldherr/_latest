  Bolivia has reclaimed its democracy. Now the hard work begins for Luis Arce and MAS. - The Washington Post 
description: > 
  Credit for the restoration of democracy goes to Bolivia’s resurgent social movements, which mobilized for weeks this summer to ensure that the twice-delayed election would finally be held.It is clear Bolivians want a return to the policies Morales pursued in office.Arce oversaw Morales’s economic policies, which brought 14 years of sustained growth.But he will do so in a notably different context than the commodity boom that coincided with Morales’s first decade in office.ADTo effectively confront these challenges, Arce would be wise to return to the roots of MAS as a social-movement party committed to radical democracy and far-reaching transformation.

In his first speech following the election, Arce proclaimed, &#8220;We have recovered democracy.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Thanks for this outcome are due not to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/07/oas-helped-undermine-not-restore-democracy-bolivia/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7">Organization of American States</a> or U.S. government. Alongside the Bolivian right, these are the principal forces <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/after-morales-resignation-a-question-for-bolivia-was-this-the-democratic-will-or-a-coup/2019/11/11/ff36ce9a-040c-11ea-9118-25d6bd37dfb1_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_4&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_7" target="_blank">that ended Bolivian democracy by supporting the November 2019 coup</a> that deposed Morales and brought a brutal right-wing authoritarian regime to power. Credit for the restoration of democracy goes to Bolivia&#8217;s resurgent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/26/if-democracy-is-restored-bolivia-thank-protesters-not-us-or-oas/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7">social movements</a>, which mobilized for weeks this summer to ensure that the twice-delayed election would finally be held. Credit is also due to the courage of Bolivia&#8217;s citizens, who defied the de facto regime&#8217;s racist fearmongering and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrtommybecker/status/1317914916708405249">displays of military might</a> to vote MAS back into office. In addition to winning the presidency, MAS also appears set to win a <a href="https://twitter.com/OVargas52/status/1318220864446484481">Senate majority</a>.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">How should we interpret MAS&#8217;s crushing victory?</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In addition to signaling the return of Bolivian democracy, the results are a resounding repudiation of the racism, repression and ineptitude of the de facto Jeanine &#193;&#241;ez regime. After swearing herself in as president, &#193;&#241;ez infamously <a href="https://www.air1.com/news/u-s-world/-the-bible-has-returned-to-the-palace-bolivia-s-new-president-8839" target="_blank">declared</a>, &#8220;The Bible has returned to the palace.&#8221; The day after Arce&#8217;s victory, more than a hundred of his supporters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/world/americas/morales-arce-bolivia-election.html">chanted</a>, &#8220;The pollera will be respected!&#8221; referencing the traditional skirt of Indigenous women. &#193;&#241;ez&#8217;s reaction to MAS&#8217;s victory has been confusing. Two early positive signs are &#193;&#241;ez&#8217;s swift recognition of Arce&#8217;s victory and her firing of the minister of government, Arturo Murillo, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/19/bolivia-is-falling-into-grips-brutal-right-wing-regime/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10">called</a> MAS supporters &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and &#8220;animals,&#8221; and oversaw the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/americas/bolivia-unrest-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">brutal crackdown</a> on dissent that left about two dozen dead in November. Yet in a disturbing and head-spinning move on Monday, &#193;&#241;ez brought Murillo <a href="https://www.unitel.tv/noticias/murillo-y-cardenas-nuevamente-posesionados-como-ministros/">back</a> into her cabinet.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">MAS&#8217;s victory is also a vindication for Morales. It is clear Bolivians want a return to the policies Morales pursued in office. Arce oversaw Morales&#8217;s economic policies, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/socialism-doesnt-work-an-emerging-middle-class-of-bolivians-would-beg-to-differ/2019/10/08/3b1cb3ae-e6f6-11e9-b0a6-3d03721b85ef_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_12" target="_blank">which brought 14 years of sustained growth</a>. This facilitated massive reductions in poverty and inequality, achieved through a variety of innovative redistributive social programs.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">A comparison between this and last year&#8217;s elections suggests, however, that voters are more committed to Morales&#8217;s program than to Morales himself. Per official results, Morales won 47 percent of the vote in 2019, 5 percent less than Arce&#8217;s apparent tally. The most likely reason for Morales&#8217;s failure to score an outright majority last year was the widespread, though far from universal, rejection of his controversial decision to stand for reelection after losing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/world/americas/bolivian-president-evo-morales-concedes-defeat-in-term-limit-referendum.html" target="_blank">2016 referendum</a> to allow the president to run for a fourth term. It is also possible Arce benefited from the widespread disgust provoked by &#193;&#241;ez.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Going forward, Arce faces four major challenges. The first is covid-19, which has killed more than <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">8,500 Bolivians</a>, giving Bolivia the fifth highest per-capita <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">death rate</a> in the world. The second is Bolivia&#8217;s economic crisis. On one hand, there&#8217;s the damage wrought by the pandemic, which as elsewhere led the government to shut down much of Bolivia&#8217;s economy and society for months. This is compounded by &#193;&#241;ez&#8217;s neoliberal policies, which Arce argues led to a <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/09/luis-arce-interview-bolivia-morales-coup">5.6 percent reduction</a> in Bolivia&#8217;s economy between November 2019 and March 2020, before the pandemic hit.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The third challenge is securing <a href="http://hrp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Black-November-English-Final_Accessible.pdf">justice</a> for victims of the &#193;&#241;ez regime. This includes not only the two dozen killed in November 2019, but the hundreds more tortured, illegally detained and persecuted throughout &#193;&#241;ez&#8217;s time in office. There is no way to bring back the dead or undo other harms, but those responsible must be held accountable.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The final challenge concerns Arce&#8217;s relationship to Morales and his complicated legacy. Arce will attempt to restore the policies that brought millions out of poverty. But he will do so in a notably different context than the commodity boom that coincided with Morales&#8217;s first decade in office.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Arce must also grapple with three major shortcomings of the Morales years: the centralization of power around Morales himself; the Morales administration&#8217;s <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4493-the-eighteenth-brumaire-of-macho-camacho-jeffery-r-webber-with-forrest-hylton-on-the-coup-in-bolivia">co-optation of social movements,</a> which had the ironic and unintended effect of hollowing out the social base that undergirded his initial ascent to office; and, relatedly, the Morales administration&#8217;s <a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1036-the-last-day-of-oppression-and-the-first-day-of-the-same">alliance with agro-industry</a> from 2011 on, which marked a 180-degree turn from the government&#8217;s initially robust support for land reform and was taken by many to signal its prioritization of staying in office over real change.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">To effectively confront these challenges, Arce would be wise to return to the roots of MAS as a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/when-movements-become-parties/F06BEE9DEA9BA4E7DCFBD9A87266FAB8">social-movement party</a> committed to radical democracy and far-reaching transformation.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><b>Read more:</b></p></div>

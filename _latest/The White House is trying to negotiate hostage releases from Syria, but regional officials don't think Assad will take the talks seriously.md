<li>The White House held secret talks with the Syrian government earlier this year in an attempt to discuss the fate of two American hostages, the therapist Majd Kamalmaz and journalist Austin Tice.</li>
<li>But regional security officials and diplomats are skeptical the Syrians will even enter serious negotiations with the US in the first place.</li>
<li>I would know: in the years after Tice's disappearance I was occasionally involved in efforts to contact the Syrian government and hopefully secure his release. The Syrians never gave me anything.</li>
<li>Sources told Insider that if Syria were willing to return Tice and Kalmamaz &#8212; if they are even alive &#8212; it would likely ask the US to withdraw its troops from the country, relieve sanctions, and even help it make peace with Israel.</li>

<p dir="ltr">Referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and US President Donald Trump, the diplomat said: "Bashar sees Trump as someone stupid who wants to leave Syria," describing conversations they have had with Lebanese and Syrian officials close to Assad.</p><p dir="ltr">"He [Assad] also knows that Trump has an election and wants hostages released for the voters," the diplomat said. "They sent senior White House aides to Damascus to talk!"</p><p dir="ltr">"But besides the question of whether he actually has these two people, who might have died in custody ... I'm not sure there would be real sanctions relief or the departure of US forces from the coalition against ISIS. And I am not sure the Syrians will be willing to talk at all unless troops leaving and sanctions lifted are part of the plan."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Dannymakkisyria/status/1318154272765247488?s=20">Analysts who closely track Damascus</a> and regime media said that it was clear the Syrians were refusing to discuss the hostages until there was a withdrawal agreement.;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This raises an additional question: if the release of Tice and Kamalmaz will require lifting sanctions and withdrawing US troops from Syrian territory, what can the Assad regime offer in addition to the apparent hostages?</p><p dir="ltr">A former Israeli intelligence official, who works as reservist for the Israel Defense Forces, said Assad would likely adopt the tactics often used by Hezbollah in its negotiations with Israel over hostages: Refuse to concede anything for free.</p><p dir="ltr">"Whenever Hezbollah took some of our guys, they'd never offer proof of life or anything on their condition," said the official, who worked on a <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-lebanon-israel/israel-and-hezbollah-sign-prisoner-swap-deal-idUKL0743478820080707">prisoner-swap deal between Hezbollah and Israel</a> in 2008. This source asked not to be named because they do not have permission to speak to the media, but their identity is known to Insider.</p><p dir="ltr">"They make you pay for everything," the official said of Hezbollah. "You want to find out their condition? Alive or dead, you pay the full price for them. I expect Bashar will do the same here. You want information on this Austin Tice? Leave Syria and I'll tell you what we know."</p>

<p id="gpt-post-defense-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-7" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p dir="ltr">"And the only thing Bashar can offer worth leaving Syria and dropping the sanctions for would be to resolve the Golan Heights, make peace with Israel, kick out the Iranians, and crack down on Hezbollah," said the Israel official.</p><p dir="ltr">"We keep hearing this rumor even here in Israel and I am sure Bashar would love to haggle or get some sanction relief, but I doubt he could deliver if he wanted to," he said. "How can he kick out the Iranians and Hezbollah? They saved his regime and are stronger than his forces."</p><p dir="ltr">The EU diplomat said they had heard the same rumors of some sort of region-resetting agreement being pitched, but said it sounded too complex to be realistic.</p><p dir="ltr">"Israel and the US aren't signing anything that doesn't manage Iran and Hebzollah," said the diplomat.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"And even if Bashar agreed to try &#8212; which I really doubt, no matter how much he wants sanction relief &#8212; Hezbollah would just kill him and replace him with Maher," they said, referring to Assad's older brother.</p>

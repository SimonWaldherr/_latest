<p>Exxon Mobil has clarified that a hypothetical fundraising conversation between President Donald Trump and its CEO, in which the president asked for and secured $25 million in campaign donations, "never happened."</p><p>The company tweeted the statement after Trump bragged at length about his fundraising abilities at a campaign event in Prescott, Arizona, on Monday, saying he would be "the greatest fundraiser in history."</p><p>He claimed that he could raise "a billion dollars in one day" if he wanted to by calling the CEOs of large Wall Street firms and energy companies.</p><p>He then described a hypothetical call between him and the head of Exxon Mobil, which you can see here:</p><p class="iframe-container"></p><p>"I call the head of Exxon, I don't know," Trump told the crowd. "'Hi, how you doing, how's energy coming, when are you doing the exploration. Oh, you need a couple of permits, huh? Ok.'"</p>

<p>"But I call the head of Exxon, I say: 'You know, I'd love you to send me $25 million for the campaign,'" Trump said, then mimicking the CEO's hypothetical response: "''Absolutely sir, why didn't you ask? Would you like some more?'"</p><p>Shortly after the event, Exxon Mobil posted a tweet saying:&#160;"We are aware of the president's statement regarding a hypothetical call with our CEO &#8230; and just so we're all clear, it never happened."</p><p>A short version of the clip &#8212; isolating the hypothetical conversation dwelling on "permits" and the $25 million request &#8212; has given rise to the suggestion that the president was describing a quid pro quo.</p><p>But earlier in the speech, he noted that larger donations would make him "compromised."</p>

<p>"I would take in more money but you know what, I don't want to do that. Because if I do that I'm totally compromised.</p><p>"Because when they call me, you know, you're a loyal person, and what happens is that you'll do things that are a lot more money."</p><p>Trump was pushing back at "when the press says" his fundraising is poor, following <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/15/trump-outraised-by-biden-in-september-383m-to-248m-429760">recent reports</a> that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's campaign had out-fundraised him by more than $135 million in September.</p>

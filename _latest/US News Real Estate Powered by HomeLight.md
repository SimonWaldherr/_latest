How U.S. News Home Value Estimates are Calculated

Online home valuation tools use automated valuation models that analyze millions of real estate transactions to estimate how much a home is worth.

Home valuation tools often lack crucial information, leading to inaccurate estimates. U.S. News has partnered with HomeLight to fill those gaps. By asking a few specific questions about your home, we add a new layer of information to our estimate and get a more accurate valuation for your home.

When you receive your home value estimate, you may also see a Simple Sale price. A Simple Sale price is the highest all-cash bid from HomeLight’s network of real estate buyers, which is typically 90-95% of your home’s market value.

If you want to better understand your home’s full market value we will connect you with a top real estate agent. Experienced real estate agents can provide a comparative market analysis based on your property and the latest trends in your local real estate market.

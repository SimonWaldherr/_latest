Background: Joe Lowry kicked off his wrestling career at 5 years old – a passion he still has today. After a brief pause in his wrestling career, Lowry picked up kickboxing in middle school. Upon entry into high school, Lowry joined the wrestling team. With his coach being an MMA fighter, Lowry tagged along to one of his coach’s weigh-ins. Around the time of his graduation, Lowry became bored with the daily grind of weightlifting. He began training MMA as a substitute, which turned into an amateur, then professional, career. In 2018, Lowry was featured on Dana White’s Contender Series and was knocked out by future UFC fighter Devonte Smith in Round 1. Shortly thereafter, Lowry was in a bad head-on car accident that injured his ankle and threatened his career. However, Lowry persevered and returned to action for CFFC earlier this year with a 129-second TKO win.

The Skinny: Whether it’s inside the cage or outside of it, Lowry has been tested. Battling through adversity, Lowry has shown his determination and focus to quite possibly be his most outstanding attribute. A union worker who still puts in eight hours per day before training, Lowry’s work ethic is supreme. His wrestling and striking are both very good, providing a difficult challenge to any fighter who steps in the cage with him. Sure, he lost to Smith on Dana White’s Contender Series. But that’s by no means a bad loss. It was the first of his career and an experience that will likely make him better in the long run. While Lowry is certainly good enough to be in the UFC, it might not be a bad idea for him to get a couple more fights in as he still is trying to rebuild strength and mobility in his ankle.

In his own words: “I’ve been competing my whole life. I didn’t have the easiest life in the world. When people ask me, ‘How long have you been fighting for?’ I always tell them, ‘I’ve been fighting my whole life, but I’ve been fighting MMA for the past 15 years.’ It’s nothing new to go out there and train and fight. I can put in the hard work.

“… What makes me different from everyone else is my heart and the way I train and my coaches. Me and my coaches are like a family. We understand each other. My coaches are improving as much as I’m improving each time I fight. We go ever techniques and strategies for different opponents. I have a great team behind me, which you need if you want to go far in this sport.”

“… My mindset right now isn’t focused on the UFC. I’m not trying to think like that. … I’m not trying to disappoint myself and get myself all hyped up waiting for a phone call. If I don’t get a phone call, I don’t want to be all bummed out about it. I’m just thinking about this fight now and that’s where my mind is. I’m training for the now. Whatever comes next comes next.”

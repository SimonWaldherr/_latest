A mum and her three kids were killed in a horror crash on the A40 near Oxford which also left her husband and toddler fighting for life in hospital.

Mummy blogger Zoe Powell, 29, died alongside her two daughters, Phoebe, eight, and Amelia, four, and their six-year-old brother Simeon.

Husband Josh, 30, and their 18-month-old baby girl survived the smash and are described as being in a “critical but stable” condition at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital.

Eyewitnesses described a “scene from hell” after coming across the accident on the A40.

The family’s silver Subaru collided with the HGV close to a railway bridge to the west of the city at 9.50pm on Monday.

Thames Valley Police said the victims came from the village of Chinnor in Oxford.

Zoe was a churchgoer and parenting writer who moved to the area with her family from Sheffield in 2014.

She ran her own company producing journals for new mothers and also edited a successful blog.

In an online interview she spoke of her love of teaching bible studies with her husband to teenagers at their local church.

They moved into temporary accommodation in recent months after their home was damaged in a fire.

A neighbour said: “They were a lovely family.”

Flowers were laid outside St Andrew’s Church in Chinnor by locals and friends of the family yesterday.

Chinnor Parish Council posted on Facebook: “We are all so saddened and shocked to hear about the tragic accident.

“The community church have created a space for flowers to be laid for the family.”

One parishioner said: “At the moment it’s just so raw. The community are very upset.”

The A40 was reopened at lunchtime after crash investigators searched for clues to the tragedy.

Police said 56-year-old lorry driver suffered minor injuries in the crash and did not need hospital treatment.

A driver who came across the immediate aftermath posted on social media that it was like a “scene from hell”.

Another motorist wrote on Facebook: “I’ve never seen anything so traumatising in my life.

“I would never want anyone to see what I did. I never thought I’d see something like that.

“Those who survived, God bless them, those who passed, RIP.”

David Patchett, who lives on a narrowboat near the scene, called 999 after seeing people seriously injured.

He said: “There was a loud explosion, a horrendous noise which shook through the boat. It was enough to make your heart jump.

“I grabbed my phone and shoes and ran out at full pelt down the road while trying to dial 999. I knew it wasn’t a good sound.

“The first thing I saw was the lorry on the wrong side of the road and saw the driver was sat there okay.

“I continued running towards the car, that’s where I could have collapsed to my knees, it was an emotional rollercoaster.

“The car was in the middle of the road, it wasn’t just front-end damage it looked like it had been crumpled like a can.

“It was a horrifying thing to see and my first thoughts were nobody had survived, that’s how bad it was.”

Sgt Dominic Mahon, of Thames Valley Police, said the crash was an “absolute tragedy”.

He added: “This incredibly tragic incident has resulted in the deaths of four people from the same family.

“Our officers and colleagues from the other emergency services were dealing with an extremely upsetting scene.

“We will leave no stone unturned to ascertain what has caused this tragedy.”

The officer appealed for witnesses or motorists who have dash-cam footage of the incident to come forward.

Youtube serves the British people better than the BBC, the company’s UK boss has claimed.

Ben McOwen Wilson, Managing Director YouTube UK, said that television channels are not providing content that speaks to all parts of the country.

The video platform is poised to overtake the BBC as the main source of media in the UK for 16 to 34 years olds, with the average user watching over 45 minutes of YouTube a day.

Mr McOwen Wilson said that the key to the website’s success is that it offered “different races, genders and regional diversity that just isn’t available in traditional media”.

He referenced Matt Morsia, a PE teacher from Folkestone, who quit his job to become a YouTuber who now “now earns way more than you or I will ever earn.”

“I don’t know that traditional media was ever looking to cast someone from Folkestone in fitness videos,” he said.

YouTube now works with the BBC to help the broadcaster increase its diversity on and off-screen.

“It is just not accurate to depict us as something that is only taking from the British creative industries,” said McOwen Wilson. “Consumers get to view content that they can’t find anywhere else.

“What we create, which the public service broadcasters do not, is an export opportunity.”

“Their success is global. It’s not limited to these shores.”

The UK’s public service broadcasters such as the BBC are legally required to invest in original news content while YouTube is not.

At an Ofcom panel last week, Tim Davie, the new BBC director general, said that he admired YouTube but that its approach would not work for the UK broadcaster.

“That is different to a public service brief curated in a way that’s meant to be universal, with all its trauma and angst,” he said.

YouTube has been criticised for its children’s programming which does not undergo the same level of scrutiny in standards as the BBC.

Mr McOwen Wilson said that the website was filling a gap for parents following reduced investment in original children’s TV from UK broadcasters.

“I care about British television,” he said. “The reality is that at a time when volume of hours was going down, platforms such as YouTube and Netflix and others were bringing content forward.”

“We are not the commissioners of that content. We are not sat there ensuring the quality of that content compared with the BBC or others. It’s not us who’s making the commissioning decision. Our role is about making sure the platform is safe for parents and children.”

Mr McOwen Wilson also warned that the platform should not overreach in censoring its contributors, despite criticisms that not enough was being done to tackle extremist material and conspiracy theory videos on its website.

“We recognise that in the UK we have a long tradition of liberal speech,” he said.

“There is that sense that we should not be overreaching in terms of closing people down because of how we would like to shape their views on the platform.

“We will absolutely remove content that is in breach of any of our policies on hate speech. But also we have a view that while we may respect free speech in terms of allowing content to be uploaded on to the platform, we will reduce that flow of viewership. Access to the YouTube algorithm is a privilege.”

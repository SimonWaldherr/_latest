title: > 
  Supreme Court justices chastise Vermont on the limits of police power in 'deer jacking' case 
description: > 
  Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the court's conservatives, joined by liberals Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said the Vermont Supreme Court missed the mark in applying the law that governs law enforcement intrusion on private property.The game wardens suspected Clyde Bovat of unlawfully hunting a deer at night, an offense Vermonters call "deer jacking."The Vermont Supreme Court said the officers acted properly, because the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches does not require an officer to ignore what can plainly be seen by passersby.In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court said the area around a home, known as the curtilage, is just as much protected by the Fourth Amendment as the home itself.While the Vermont court got the law wrong, Gorsuch said, he understood why the full U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case.

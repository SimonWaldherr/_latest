<div><p>Virgin Media has warned of the damage that could be inflicted on the telecoms industry if BT strikes &#8220;deeply discounted&#8221; broadband deals with rivals. The company fears competing network builders could suffer if Openreach,&#160;BT&#8217;s broadband builder,&#160;is allowed to offer long-term wholesale contracts on the cheap.&#160;</p>
<p>The cable operator has pressed regulators to &#8220;monitor the behaviour&#8221; of Openreach as it renegotiates with customers while upgrading the nation to ultra-fast broadband.</p>
<p>In a submission to communications regulator Ofcom, Virgin Media said &#8220;much more detail&#8221; was needed on how to solve the &#8220;conundrum&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a larger retailer negotiates a deeply discounted and long-term deal, it is unlikely to focus on committing to a partnership with an alternative infrastructure provider if such a deal should jeopardise the discounts received from Openreach,&#8221; Virgin Media said. &#8220;If Openreach were successful in securing the large majority of its wholesale customer base on long-term arrangements, it is difficult to see how competition from alt-nets would not be adversely impacted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virgin Media, the UK&#8217;s second biggest telecoms network, is owned by Liberty Global, the New York-listed company controlled by billionaire &#8220;cable cowboy&#8221; John Malone.&#160;</p>
<p>Pay-TV giant Sky was reportedly in talks with Liberty Global last year over investing in &#8211;&#160;and becoming a customer of &#8211;&#160;a new full-fibre network that would stiffen the competition with BT. Since then, Liberty Global has upped the pressure on BT by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/07/virgin-media-o2-seal-31bn-merger/">unveiling a &#163;31bn mega-merger</a> in May between Virgin Media and mobile operator O2.</p>
<p>Mike Fries, Liberty Global&#8217;s chief executive, said on Wednesday that once the merger was complete, it would look at building a &#8220;robust network&#8221; in the UK.&#160;</p>
<p>He said it might be &#8220;potentially with other partners, potentially with financial partners, creating some sort of wholesale arrangements&#8221; that could be &#8220;very accretive and very interesting&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>Ministers are counting on Virgin Media and BT to play a key role in blanketing Britain in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/03/boris-johnsons-5bn-fibre-plan-risks-bureaucratic-car-crash/">gigabit speeds by 2025</a>.</p>

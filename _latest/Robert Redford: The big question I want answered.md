(CNN) I'm not in the habit of quoting lines from movies I've appeared in, but every once in a while, something brings one of those old lines to mind. Recently, I've been thinking of a scene from a film I did in 1972 called "The Candidate."

Robert Redford

My character, Bill McKay, is running for the US Senate from California. At the end of a televised debate, McKay is prompted to give his closing statement. He veers off script -- casting aside the careful messages his consultants had crafted -- and speaks from the heart. "I think it's important to note what subjects we haven't discussed," he says. He mentions race, and poverty and urban blight. "We haven't discussed any of the sicknesses that may yet send this country up in flames."

I've thought of that scene as I've watched the land near my home in California go up in flames -- literally. The wildfires there, like the ones in Oregon and Washington and Colorado, did draw some news coverage, as you'd expect them to. But climate change -- which is creating the conditions for fires like these and for extreme, destructive weather of other kinds -- isn't being discussed to any meaningful degree.

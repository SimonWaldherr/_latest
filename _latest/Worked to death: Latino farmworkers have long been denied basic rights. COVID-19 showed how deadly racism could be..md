<div><p>Latinos were denied fair pay, leaving them vulnerable to COVID-19. In this six-part series, USA TODAY investigates how racism killed people of color.</p><p class="dropcap">CALEXICO, Calif. &#8211; Jos&#233; Alfredo Reyes&#8217; wife and son pulled on personal protective gear and entered his San Diego hospital room.</p><p>&#8220;Can you hear us?&#8221; Margarita Reyes said. Her husband&#8217;s eyes remained shut, but his body twitched.</p><p>She leaned in low to his ear and told him that his elderly mother, his children and his grandchildren would all be OK. She told him she loved him.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Jos&#233; Alfredo Reyes, 59, was dead.&#160;</p><p class="oembed-frame">
</p><p>Jos&#233; Alfredo Reyes, a longtime farmworker in this agricultural county of 181,000, is one of thousands in Imperial County to be sickened or killed by COVID-19, the disease spawned by the coronavirus. Imperial County, which is 85% Hispanic, has consistently had one of the highest death rates in the United States, at a time when Latinos are one of the hardest-hit ethnic groups in the pandemic, according to data compiled by USA TODAY.</p><p>Farmworkers here pull from the ground the lettuce and broccoli that end up on dinner plates across America. This work often means low wages, poor nutrition and scant access to health care &#8211; factors that put them in the crosshairs of the coronavirus.</p><p>Many of Imperial County&#8217;s residents are U.S. citizens&#160;yet are often treated in the fields like foreign visitors without basic workers&#8217; rights. They live among industrialized farms surrounded by desert. The opulent mansions of San Diego are a two-hour drive west.&#160;</p><p>It is one of the poorest and unhealthiest places in California, with high rates of unemployment and child poverty. Nearly a quarter of families depend on federal assistance for food.&#160;</p><p>Imperial County&#8217;s suffering mirrors the struggles of many Latinos across the nation, who are more likely than non-Hispanic white Americans&#160;to face poverty and poor nutrition after centuries of being pushed into low-paying jobs and segregated communities. Now, they are also more likely to die from COVID-19. As of Oct. 15, Imperial County had counted 335 COVID-related deaths. That&#8217;s 185 deaths per 100,000 residents &#8211; nearly triple the national rate of 66 per 100,000. Neighboring San Diego County, which has half the percentage of Hispanic residents, has a drastically lower death rate (26 per 100,000).</p><p>&#8220;I thought it was going to be as bad as it got in San Diego,&#8221; said Dr. Christian Tomaszewski, chief medical officer at El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of Imperial County&#8217;s two hospitals. &#8220;It was a ton worse.&#8221;</p><p class="ad-container tealplayer-ad-container"></p><p class="video-details title show-length">Farmworkers in California's Imperial Valley risk their health in order to pay the bills</p><p class="video-details caption">California's farmworkers are left with a difficult decision during the pandemic - risk their health and life at work or go without food and rent money?</p><p class="video-details attribution">Omar Ornelas and Sandy Hooper, USA TODAY</p><p class="custom-chapter-marker no-image" id="a-mother-prays"><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">A mother prays for her daughter&#8217;s life&#160;</h2></p><p>Maria Guadalupe Ortega Valladarez was in her Calexico apartment in May when she felt the first pangs of a headache.&#160;</p><p>She thought it was yet another flare-up from her failing kidneys, an ailment derived from decades of farm work. Life in Imperial Valley had led to a host of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.&#160;</p><p>Then, the nagging headache morphed into body aches, fever and loss of appetite. This was something different. Her son-in-law drove Ortega Valladarez, 60, to the&#160;hospital, where she tested positive for COVID-19.&#160;</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/16/USAT/6fc6dc32-dd75-42a0-81f0-f32e2c9e43fb-_MG_2051.JPG?width=7" alt="Maria Guadalupe Ortega Valladarez worked in the fields of Imperial County, Calif., for 40 years.

The only people who saw her were the doctors and nurses dressed in gowns and masks.&#160;</p><p>Originally from Mexicali, Mexico, Ortega Valladarez, one of 14 siblings, migrated to the United States with her family when she was 18 and immediately started laboring in the fields with her father and four siblings.&#160;</p><p>Back then, growers weren&#8217;t required to provide shade for farmworkers. She and her family broiled under the sun during eight-hour shifts, earning less than $5 an hour.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;It felt like death,&#8221; she remembered.&#160;</p><p>During her best years, she earned $19,000&#160;annually.&#160;As she had kids, earning enough to cover rent, food and school supplies became a constant challenge. In the fields, there was no time for healthy meals. Her diet turned to sandwiches or tacos with meat and beans.&#160;</p><p class="oembed-frame">
</p><p>When she was around 50, Ortega Valladarez developed symptoms of diabetes. She felt tired, lethargic and thirsty. It was no surprise: Her whole family had the disease and three siblings had died of it.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t deal with it because I was working,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t give me time to go to the doctor.&#8221;</p><p>At around the same time, her kidneys began to fail, and she was diagnosed with cataracts, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. She started going blind in her left eye, which forced her to stop working the fields two years ago.</p><p>Today, Ortega Valladarez shares a three-bedroom apartment with her daughter, son-in-law and their two kids. She scrapes by on $900 monthly Social Security checks.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;I have the desire to work, but I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she said.</p><p>After her two-day hospital stay in May, Ortega Valladarez returned home to find her daughter, Alejandra Rodr&#237;guez, 25, sick in bed, awaiting her own COVID-19 test results. She tested positive and spent four nights in the hospital, receiving oxygen.&#160;</p><p>Ortega Valladarez cried, fearing her daughter would die.</p>

The arid, desert climate made it unsuitable&#160;for crops, but a series of canals built in the early 1900s to divert the Colorado River allowed farmers to plant lettuce, alfalfa and more &#8212; thirsty plants that could never grow there naturally. In the 1930s, at the behest of the increasingly powerful farming community, federal engineers created the 82-mile All-American Canal, an aqueduct to irrigate farms across 500,000 acres and to power hydroelectric plants.&#160;</p><p>The canal network funneled water into the hands of a few farmers on the American side of the border and laid the groundwork for large-scale industrial farms, consolidating power in the region for decades to come, said Paul Kibel, an environmental law professor at the&#160;Golden Gate University School of Law in San Francisco. But as laborers across the country were unionizing to&#160;collectively bargain for better wages and working conditions, farmworkers were blocked from collective bargaining by the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, credited with lifting tens of millions of mostly white and Black workers into the middle class.</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/16/USAT/72953654-4229-4802-862a-f69301a8017b-IMPERIAL_COUNTY_ORNELAS293_copy_2.jpg?width=7" alt="Silverio Alvarado harvests romanesco cauliflower in Imperial Valley on March 24, 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic."><p class="image-zoom__modal-trigger"></p><p class="in-depth-image-caption-container">Silverio Alvarado harvests romanesco cauliflower in Imperial Valley on March 24, 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.<p class="in-depth-image-credit">Omar Ornelas, USA TODAY Network</p></p><p>Frustrated by poor pay and working conditions, Imperial Valley&#8217;s farmworkers, who were mostly Mexican or Chicano, launched repeated strikes in the 1930s. They were bitterly and violently opposed by local government, farmers and the producers who bought the vegetables. &#65279;In early 1934, police and vigilantes surrounded a hall where hundreds of strikers had gathered with their families, blasting the building with tear gas and fire hoses as frightened women and children scrambled out through the windows. Local newspapers whipped up anti-worker sentiment, and police burned down strike encampments after declaring that picketing was illegal, in part due to fears that communists were helping organize.</p><p>Labor organizers &#8211; some of whom were communists &#8211;&#160; eventually gave up trying to unionize the workers. Farmers and producers retained the upper hand.</p><p>In the 1940s, another federal initiative would leave a lasting impact on Imperial County. The&#160;Mexican Agricultural Labor Program, also know as the &#8220;Bracero Program,&#8221;&#160;drew 5 million Mexican workers to the United States over its 22-year history &#8211; many of them to the Imperial Valley.&#160;Named for the Spanish word for arms -- brazos -- braceros were Mexican citizens permitted to work as seasonal agricultural workers in the U.S.</p><p>Started in 1942, the program ostensibly provided better working conditions in the American fields, including shelter and sanitation. But it was entirely controlled by the growers and enforced with armed guards, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor-union professor at Cornell University in New York. Workers couldn't&#160;leave for other jobs&#160;and anyone deemed a troublemaker could be "sent home" to Mexico, she said. Growers and producers supported the program, she said, because it gave them more control over the workforce and reduced the threat of strikes.</p><p>As a result, the labor force was constantly turning over, making it hard for workers to settle down and buy homes &#8211; a system that cemented a legacy of poverty and low wages in Imperial County, Bronfenbrenner said.&#160;</p>

About 20% of California&#8217;s estimated 1 million farmworkers receive unemployment in a given year, according to state labor officials.</p><p>Across the country, farmworkers are rarely represented by unions the way autoworkers, teachers and bus drivers are. That lack of representation often shuts them out of access to unemployment pay, worker&#8217;s compensation and health insurance.

      </p><p>After consulting with state leaders, officials at El Centro transferred more than 250 intubated patients to hospitals more than 600 miles away in San Francisco and Sacramento. Soon after, the California National Guard helped open an 80-bed field hospital in the nearby Imperial Valley College gymnasium.</p><p>Even as the crush of patients began to ebb around late summer, questions nagged at Tomaszewski: How did his hospital end up with so many COVID-19 patients and, more importantly, why were so many critically ill?</p><p class="oembed-frame">

The&#160;Environmental Protection Agency in 1987 formally recognized that blowing dust in Imperial Valley, from vehicles on dirt roads, farm erosion and the drying Salton Sea, poses a health risk to residents, who&#160;have elevated rates of asthma. Obesity is associated with the development of asthma and worsening asthma symptoms, according to the CDC.</p><p>About&#160;80% of the hospital&#8217;s COVID-19 patients had underlying health issues, Tomaszewski said.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Now throw in a virus that takes advantage of the weakest," he said.</p><p>At Frye Chapel and Mortuary in Brawley,&#160;white vans darted in and out of the parking lot one after another, day after day, delivering bodies.

She said her heart broke each time she had to tell family members they couldn't have services, and even had to deny a family's request for an outdoor viewing in a parking lot.&#160;</p><p>When too many family members of the deceased tried to come into the funeral home to discuss arrangements, she started locking the door.</p><p>Can I see them? they would ask.&#160;</p><p>Again and again, the answer was no.&#160;</p><p class="custom-chapter-marker no-image" id="waiting-at-dawn"><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">Waiting at dawn for food, buying fruit at a discount</h2></p><p>On a recent September morning, hundreds of people lined up for assistance at the Imperial Valley Food Bank&#8217;s monthly food distribution at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Calexico. Many waited in their cars, air-conditioning humming. Some arrived on foot and stood, with some social distancing, in a line that wrapped around the block. Others sat in lawn chairs next to pushcarts they soon filled with&#160;eggs, milk, frozen chicken, potatoes and bread.&#160;</p><p>Ivania Rocha, 60, arrived at 7 a.m., an hour before doors opened, and sat in a pink camping chair next to a black cart. She worked for years in Imperial Valley&#8217;s fields, harvesting broccoli, lettuce and watermelons, but stopped in March and hasn&#8217;t worked since. Rocha has diabetes and was afraid she would contract the virus, she said.&#160;</p><p>Her biggest concern: carpooling to the fields, as thousands of laborers do each day.

They likely got it while traveling together, she said. Because crops become ready for harvest at different times, workers may end up driving an hour east to Arizona, or about 80 miles north to the Coachella Valley, to reach the field sites.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;There needs to be social distancing,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and there&#8217;s not going to be social distancing in the cars.&#8221;</p><p>Farmworker Guadalupe Serreno has worked in the fields for about two decades, harvesting onions, asparagus, lettuce, cauliflower and melons.</p><p>Usually, she migrates with the crops, following the onion harvest from Imperial County north to Bakersfield and then east to the Mojave Desert city of Lancaster. The workers, clad in pants and long-sleeved shirts to protect themselves from the sun and dust, clip the tops and bottoms off red, yellow and white onions, which are then dried in burlap bags before being transported to supermarkets.&#160;</p><p>On the road, Serreno, 42, shares the cost of a hotel room with three other laborers, often for weeks at a time.&#160;</p><p>That life halted March 21, as the pandemic infiltrated the United States. The agriculture company she works for hasn&#8217;t called with a job since. Even if it did, she&#8217;d be afraid of bringing the virus into the one-bedroom mobile home in El Centro she shares with her 70-year-old father and 4-year-old daughter, Luna, who has asthma and uses an inhaler twice a day.&#160;</p>

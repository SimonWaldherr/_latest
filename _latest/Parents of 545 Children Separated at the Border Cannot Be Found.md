  Parents of 545 Children Separated at the Border Cannot Be Found 
description: > 
  Their efforts are part of a wide-ranging campaign to track down parents separated from their children at the U.S. border beginning in 2017 under the Trump administration’s most controversial immigration policy.It is now clear that the parents of 545 of the migrant children still have not been found, according to court documents filed this week in a case challenging the practice.About 60 of the children were under the age of 5 when they were separated, the documents show.Though attempts to find the separated parents have been going on for years, the number of parents who have been deemed “unreachable” is much larger than was previously known.Under court order, the government first provided an accounting of separated families in June of 2018, reporting that about 2,700 children had been taken from their parents after crossing into the United States.

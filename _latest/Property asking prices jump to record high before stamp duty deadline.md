  Sellers hiked the average asking price for a property in Britain up 1.1pc in the last month to hit a new record high as buyers rush to complete sales before the stamp duty holiday deadline.The post-pandemic property “mini-boom” has driven up the average price tag of a home to £323,530, according to property website Rightmove.This is an annual jump of 5.5pc and the fastest rate of growth in more than four years.The index measures asking prices rather than what property actually sells for, but it is an accurate reflection of seller sentiment, and a key forward indicator for sale prices.Buyers are rushing to transact before the stamp duty deadline in March.

<div><p>Sellers hiked the average asking price for a property in Britain up 1.1pc&#160;in the last month to hit a new record high&#160;as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/house-prices/house-prices-jump-73pc-september-nearly-250000-boom-cant-last/">buyers rush to complete sales</a>&#160;before the stamp duty holiday deadline.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/postcodes-driving-property-market-mini-boom-ones-left-behind/">post-pandemic property &#8220;mini-boom&#8221; </a>has driven up the average&#160;price tag of&#160;a home to&#160;&#163;323,530, according to property website Rightmove.</p>
<p>This is an annual jump of 5.5pc and the fastest rate of growth in more than four years.&#160;</p>
<p>The index measures <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/owners-londons-expensive-homes-racing-sell-house-prices-fall/">asking prices</a> rather than what property actually sells for, but it is an accurate reflection of seller sentiment, and a key forward indicator for sale prices.</p>
<p>Rightmove expects the momentum to continue over the next few months, and for the pace of growth to peak at a rate of 7pc by December.&#160;</p>
<p>Buyers are <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/house-prices/post-lockdown-property-rush-pushes-cost-moving-ladder-record/">rushing to transact</a> before the stamp duty deadline in March. But&#160;sales are now beset with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/mortgage-wait-times-soaring-putting-homebuyers-risk-losing/">processing delays for mortgages</a>, conveyancing and local authority checks, due to the lockdown backlog, reduced processing capacity and higher demand.&#160;</p>

<div><p>What part are the council leaders of Glasgow and Edinburgh playing in the formulation of the new strategy? Are they being consulted? &#160;What is their view of the dire effects on their pubs, restaurants and hotels, especially the unemployment that&#8217;s resulted, of the First Minister&#8217;s total control so far? Are they in full agreement?</p>
<p>And if not, why are they not speaking up? Is it because both councils are SNP controlled and are used to doing what they&#8217;re told by Ms Sturgeon?</p>
<p>What Susan Aitken and Adam McVey, SNP council leaders in Glasgow and Edinburgh, respectively, are certainly not doing is following the example of Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbench MPs, and several other Tory MPs in challenging their Tory government and even backing the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham.</p>
<p>And what of CoSLA, which represents all of Scotland&#8217;s councils? Is it a party to what&#8217;s on the cards for us in the near future. Not as far as we know.</p>
<p>What is happening is that all the opposition party leaders have been invited by the First Minister to have a wee sneaky view of her plans today (tues) before a formal expose by the end of the week and then some form of debate and a vote at Holyrood next week.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2020/10/15/party-leaders-should-reject-first-ministers-hole-in-the-corner/">already aired my distaste for this situation</a> and think the Tory, Labour and Lib Dem leaders are mugs to have agreed to be sucked into Ms Sturgeon&#8217;s plan like this - unless, of course, they&#8217;ve been told they can influence things and, more importantly, that they can immediately tell the voters what&#8217;s in store for them.&#160;</p>
<p>What they should have done is demanded a recall of Holyrood this week to hear and vote on the FM&#8217;s plans. &#160;</p>
<p>The party leaders needn&#8217;t take my word for how Scottish government &#8216;consultation&#8217; works. With both of Scotland&#8217;s biggest cities run by the SNP and apparently struck dumb about their party&#8217;s national policy on Covid, it&#8217;s left to the co-leaders of the country&#8217;s third city, Aberdeen to speak out.</p>
<p>Said the Tories&#8217; Douglas Lumsden: "With the secrecy and complete lack of transparency, it&#8217;s almost like living in some sort of Soviet state &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Scottish Government wouldn&#8217;t be happy if the UK Government imposed lockdown restrictions on Scotland. So we&#8217;re not happy when the Scottish Government do that to local authorities. We&#8217;ve been elected to represent Aberdeen and it&#8217;s only fair and right that we play a part in any of those lockdown decisions that are made. We know this area much better than the First Minister does. So we&#8217;re best placed to make those decisions."</p>
<p>Added Labour&#8217;s Jenny Laing:&#8217;There&#8217;s a complete lack of transparency. Initially the Scottish Government said they would work in partnership with local authorities, but from our experience it&#8217;s completely different.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>At least in Aberdeen someone has a different point of view.</p>

Lindsey Graham promised a Supreme Court seat is 'waiting' for Amy Coney Barrett as he praised the nominee for her pro-life views and attacked fellow senators for making the hearing about other issues.

'This is the first time in American history that we've nominated a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology, and she is going to the court,' Graham lauded. 'A seat at the table is waiting on you.'

He continued: 'I have never been more proud of a nominee than you.'

Graham claimed during his allotted 20 minutes Wednesday that female conservatives and conservatives of color have 'a hard time of it.' He said their contributions are marginalized by those on the left because they 'come out on a different side of an issue – particularly abortion.'

Barrett spent much of Tuesday fielding questions related to her personal pro-life views, especially if she would be in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade, which Democrats fear would be the case if she were confirmed.

The 48-year-old nominee, however, remained a stonewall in saying she would not comment or commit to which way she would lean or rule in future or potential cases, adding she had not made any pre-commitments or promises.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Graham kicked off the second day of questioning by tearing into his colleagues on the panel – specifically vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

'Senator Harris mentioned about how much more candid Justice Ginsburg was,' Graham said. 'And, with all due respect to Senator Harris I don't agree with that.'

Notably, Barrett referenced Ginsburg's words from her own confirmation hearing when refusing to commit to how she would rule or if she would recuse herself from specific cases.

Amy Coney Barrett arrives on Capitol Hill for the second full day of questioning from senators presiding over her confirmation hearing

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham praised Barrett for being 'unashamedly pro-life' and vowed there is a seat on the Supreme Court 'waiting on you'

The second day of questioning comes as Barrett saw a boost in popularity Wednesday morning after facing a full day of grilling from all 22 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee the day before

Graham continued: 'This hearing has been more Obamacare than it has about you. Obamacare is on the ballot.'

'Today is about you. And today is about whether you're qualified to serve on the highest court in the land,' the South Carolina Republican said.

Barrett arrived at the Hart Senate Office Building Wednesday for the third day of her confirmation hearing – with her large family again in tow.

Like the two days of opening arguments and questioning before, protesters clashed on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

Those opposing Barrett's confirmation held signs reading 'Stop Amy' and 'Save the ACA' as they chanted against the nominee. Pro-life counter-protesters also showed up in droves to show their support for Barrett.

Young demonstrators wore t-shirts that read, 'The pro-life generation votes'.

As Barrett faced her second day of grilling from senators on the Judiciary Committee, a new poll released Wednesday morning shows she is gaining popularity among registered voters.

A Politico/Morning Consult survey shows 48 per cent of American voters want Barrett's confirmation to get through in contrast to a previous poll that showed only 37 per cent felt President Donald Trump should choose the next Supreme Court Justice.

And this survey also shows support from Democrats for her confirmation jumped by 13 points.

Barrett, 48, walked into the first day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Monday with less support for her confirmation than she now holds.

But the poised judge would not be rattled, even as she faced a harsh line of questioning from Democrats Tuesday on her personal beliefs and choices and what her confirmation could mean for crucial cases involving healthcare, abortion and the 2020 election.

Protests ensue: Like Monday and Tuesday, demonstrators gathered and clashed on Capitol Hill with those opposing and supporting Barrett's confirmation

Those against pushing the nominee through held signs reading, 'Stop Amy' and 'Save the ACA'

Pro-life protesters also showed up in droves to show support for Barrett, wearing t-shirts claiming, 'The pro-life generation VOTES'

Each of 22 members of the panel delivered opening remarks Monday before swearing in Barrett and hearing her opening statement, where she promised to apply the law as written as the true originalist and textualist she is.

All day Tuesday, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals judge faced questions from each member.

The senators were awarded 30 minutes to interact with Barrett, whether that be through monologuing their time or grilling her on her judicial – and personal – record.

The second and final day of questioning Wednesday will conclude with senators receiving 20 more minutes to interact with Barrett.

Donald Trump announced Barrett's nomination at a Rose Garden event on September 26 – now known as a 'super spreader' event that sparked a coronavirus outbreak within the president's inner circle.

So far, no senators have brought up the event during their questioning of Barrett, who tested positive for COVID-19 over the summer but has not since then.

A few dozen high profile individuals contracted the virus and tested positive following that White House event – including the president, first lady Melania Trump and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.

Most recently, Labor Secretary and son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Eugene Scalia's wife Trish tested positive.

Barrett, in a break with other justices, said she would be open to allowing cameras in the Supreme Court, a move news organizations and public interest groups have been advocating for years.

Under questioning from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, one of the oldest members of the Judiciary panel, Barrett said she would consider the issue.

'I, probably at 87 years of age, won't live long enough to see done, but I've discussed cameras in the courtroom,' Grassley said during his time to question the nominee.

Barrett responded: 'I would certainly keep an open mind about allowing cameras in the Supreme Court.'

The Supreme Court does not allow cameras in the courtroom when the court is in session, a policy which is the subject of much debate, particularly given that the House of Representatives and Senate allow cameras when they are in session.

Both recording devices and still cameras are banned from the highest court in the nation.

For court proceedings, transcripts of oral arguments are available later the day and audio recordings are available at the end of the week.

And there's no indication that will change any time soon.

Associate Justices Elena Kagan and Samuel Alito, when they testified before a House committee on the court's budget needs in March, were both against the idea.

'I think we would filter ourselves in ways that would be unfortunate,' Kagan said.

Alito agreed arguments should stay off camera.

'Allowing the arguments to be televised would undermine their value to us as a step in the decision-making process,' he said.

But the coronavirus pandemic nudged the court toward a more open policy.

In May, the Supreme Court conducted oral arguments via telephone and allowed the public to listen via a feed, providing real-time audio of oral arguments for the first time in its history.

The no-camera policy also has given rise to a uniquely Washington D.C. tradition – the running of the interns.

When the court announces a decision on a major case, it is printed out in the clerk's office and distributed to the waiting interns of various news organizations, who then run them to the on-camera correspondents waiting outside.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham has predicted Barrett's confirmation no later than Tuesday, October 27 – just one before Election Day.

Barrett's large family, including her husband, six of her seven children and her six siblings, again joined her for the third day of her confirmation hearing

Her children were lauded for their behavior and manner during the hearing as they sat behind her right shoulder, and at times exited the hearing room for a break from the long three days of procedures

On each of the three days of the hearing, Barrett was joined by her large family in the Hart hearing room with her husband Jesse, six of her seven children and her six siblings all sitting behind her for the majority of the two days.

Her youngest son, who has Down Syndrome, remained at home.

While Republicans focused on Barrett's family, faith, as a Roman Catholic, and academic and judicial records, Democrats targeted her on abortion, the Affordable Care Act, and whether she will recuse herself if she is confirmed and the election results end up in front of the Supreme Court.

Barrett refused to commit to anything one way or the other and said it would be inappropriate to say she would recuse herself before looking at the facts of a specific case.

Many Democrats argue Barrett's confirmation should not go through before November 3, claiming the rush job is an insurance policy from Trump for a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court should any election disputes end up there.

They also claim the fast-action comes to make sure she is seated on the court ahead of oral arguments on the ACA beginning November 11 – just days after the election.

If Barrett is confirmed – the most likely course of action with a GOP-majority Senate – Trump will have drastically impacted the makeup of the Supreme Court by placing an unprecedented three justices during his first term.

Most concerning for many progressives is Barrett's view on abortion as a devout Catholic who has publicly shared her pro-life stance in the past.

But the mother of seven has assured her integrity as a judge, and said any personal views would not be reflected in her deciding cases based on her originalist view of the Constitution.

Democrats protest that Barrett could overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which made women's access to a safe and legal abortion the status quo across the nation without excessive government restriction.

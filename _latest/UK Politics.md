The county's chamber of commerce cites government reports, which say that queues of 7,000 trucks are possible on the approach to Channel ports leading to delays of up to two days, as new sets of customs checks and inspections of goods such as meat are brought in.

The chamber's chief executive, Rob Johnston said:"Our concern now is for businesses that don’t import or export themselves but rely on imported goods or components."

He said all companies should check with suppliers to see if they needed to stock up ahead of the end of the Brexit transitional year on 31 December, and the chamber had updated its advice .

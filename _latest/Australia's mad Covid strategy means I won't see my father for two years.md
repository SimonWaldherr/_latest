I’ve been thinking a lot about numbers of late. Which is ironic because I am terrible at maths – so bad I once put the wrong phone number down on my own CV. But even an innumerate muppet like me can tell that our country’s approach to Covid-19 doesn’t add up.

This is a virus with a survival rate in the region of 99.8 per cent, which has cost the British economy tens of billions of pounds already, and hundreds of billions more going forward. Not to mention that our Government’s mad, society-strangling, financially foreboding lockdown measures will probably end up taking more lives than it saves. Quite clearly that is a bad equation.

Here’s another number I’m not a fan of: 425, the minimum number of days until I can see my father and siblings again. Add that to the time we’ve already spent apart and that’s 790 days. They live in Australia, you see; a country with a coronavirus strategy even more bonkers than the UK’s.

This week, Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced that borders will likely be closed for another year. “International travel,” he says, “including by tourists and international students, is assumed to remain largely closed off until late next year and then gradually return over time.” This, he says, is only “assuming” there will be a vaccine available “around the end of 2021.” What if there isn’t?

I called my father this morning to deliver the latest news. Qantas, Australia’s flag carrier has already parked its entire long-haul fleet until at least mid-2021, so we knew it would be a while longer before we could reunite. But borders closed for another year?

“I’m a prisoner!” he retorted, and made a joke about Australia reverting to a convict nation. Which it sort of has; the difference being that its modern citizens have done nothing to deserve their confinement. Indeed, in the name of fighting this virus, dangerous only to a small fraction of the population, the Australian army has been deployed and civilian snitches recruited to catch out people who break even the most arbitrary rules.

At least in the UK we’re allowed to leave the country and travel if we want to, albeit to face a limply enforced quarantine period upon our return. My father, unsurprisingly keen for a break, looked into meeting me somewhere in Europe back in August.

For that he’d have to apply for written permission from the Government to leave the country under exceptional circumstances, and would almost certainly be denied. Were he to somehow escape, he would upon re-entering Australia not be sent home to self-isolate, but confined to a State-approved facility for 14 days (and pay $3,000 for the privilege).

My little sister, 21, and brother, 18, should be at university in Melbourne enjoying the sort of reckless freedom that marks one’s ascent into adulthood. Instead they are at home, bored witless, plugged into online lectures, staring down a future in which they’ll have to pay for all this mass hysteria with a lifetime of inflated taxes.

In an average year, 158,000 Australians pop their clogs. There have been not even 900 Covid-19 deaths in the country thus far, which you might say is an impressively low figure – proof that its stringent lockdown is worth it. But at what cost? Analysis of Frydenberg’s latest federal budget predicts that Australia will be in debt over this until at least 2080. Another ridiculous and grossly unnecessary number, again, for a virus that almost definitely will not harm the vast majority of the population.

The Australian government knows what will happen if it opens the borders, merely by looking at Europe over the summer. There will be an inevitable surge in cases as foreigners mingle with a population that has been denied the chance to build up any significant level of herd immunity. Most cases will be asymptomatic.

There will be more deaths too, as there have been in Europe, but nowhere near the number that would justify us continuing to live in this muzzled dystopian world we’ve dug ourselves into. More people die of tuberculosis every year than have died from Covid-19. The same is true of road accidents. These are all risks we have to live alongside, not hermetically seal ourselves from.

I last saw my Australian family last Christmas. I certainly won’t see them this Christmas, or possibly even the next. It’s frustrating and sad but my plight is nothing compared to that of the millions of people around the world whose lives had been wrecked, not by the virus, but our neurotic and miscalculated response to it.

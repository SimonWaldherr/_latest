  Joe Biden campaign deploys top surrogates while candidate preps for final debate President Barack Obama makes his first in-person campaign stop on Wednesday.Biden's absence on the trail ahead of his final debate clash with President Donald Trump has drawn criticism from Republicans, who have sought to cast the nominee as "hiding in his basement."A consistent presence on the campaign trail this month has come from a duo that likely knows the Democratic ticket better than anyone -- the candidate's spouses.The campaign has largely turned to drive-in rallies to replicate the traditional campaign trail feel following their success with the model during the final night of the Democratic National Convention in August.Still, the Biden campaign has continued to find success in some virtual aspects of the campaign, getting a boost from famous faces in virtual fundraising.

<div><p>Joe Biden campaign deploys top surrogates while candidate preps for final debate President Barack Obama makes his first in-person campaign stop on Wednesday.</p><p>As former Vice President Joe Biden stays off the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Elections" target="_blank">campaign trail</a> in the days leading up to Thursday's final presidential debate, a stable of surrogates spanning the ideological spectrum of the Democratic Party has been crisscrossing the country to get the nominee's message out in the race's final days.</p><p>Biden's absence on the trail ahead of his final debate clash with President Donald Trump has drawn criticism from Republicans, who have sought to cast the nominee as "hiding in his basement." But it also gives Democrats a chance to highlight an array of voices who could help them juice turnout in key battleground states in the waning days of the campaign.</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads incontentTeads--story ad-slot"></p><p id="_ap_link_election_Elections_">One of those key figures, former President Barack Obama, is set to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-campaign-philadelphia-biden-week-race-enters-final/story?id=73589662" target="_blank">make his first in-person campaign appearance</a> on behalf of Biden this cycle at a drive-in event in Philadelphia on Thursday, an appearance where he is expected to highlight the historic stakes of this <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/elections" id="_ap_link_election_Elections_" target="_blank">election</a> and emphasize the urgency of voting early. He will also discuss the importance of down-ballot races, according to an Obama aide.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Former President Barack Obama speaks by video feed on the third night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Aug. 19. 2020." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>A consistent presence on the campaign trail this month has come from a duo that likely knows the Democratic ticket better than anyone -- the candidate's spouses.</p><p>Biden's wife, Dr. Jill Biden, has headlined roughly 25 events in eight battleground states in October -- including Florida, Georgia and Texas -- in addition to a steady flow of virtual events. Douglas Emhoff, Harris' husband, has also hit a diverse slate of over a dozen battleground states this month, with many events centered around early voting.</p><p>Biden himself has visited eight different battleground states in October, including multiple visits to Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- three states pivotal to his chances of defeating Trump.</p><p id="_ap_link_Elizabeth Warren_ElizabethWarren_">Several of Biden's former Democratic rivals have also hit the trail to stump for the ticket, with Sen. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/elizabeth-warren" id="_ap_link_Elizabeth Warren_ElizabethWarren_" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a>, D-Mass., Sen. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/bernie-sanders" id="_ap_link_Bernie Sanders_BernieSanders_" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a>, I-Vt., Andrew Yang and Pete Buttigieg holding events across battlegrounds states on behalf of Biden and Harris.</p><p>"I think there's a lot of folks who have voted Republican their whole lives, out of habit if nothing else, who are starting to say, 'Wait a minute, this isn't me,'" Buttigieg said during a campaign stop in Stockbridge, Michigan, on Monday, hoping to peel off GOP voters.</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads2 incontentTeads2--story ad-slot"></p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Sen.

It is also a very strong contrast to Trump, who has not grown his base in any way. In addition, this strategy makes it difficult for a Trump to split the Democratic base that Biden has built," Amanda Renteria, the national political director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, told ABC News.</p><p>"Momentum is the driving factor at this point. [Surrogates] will be in every key district and keep the energy up as lines continue to form. This year is also an important year because people have so many unusual pressures on them, so the extra energy, support, headlines and events are even more critical," Renteria added.</p><p>In the days leading up to the debate, Biden's team of surrogates have zeroed in on the make-or-break Rust Belt states of the Midwest, with both Jill Biden and Buttigieg making trips to Michigan ahead of the debate, and Sanders expected to join the list of surrogates stumping in Pennsylvania on Sunday.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Dr. Jill Biden speaks during a campaign event at Utepils Brewery, Oct. 3, 2020, in Minneapolis.

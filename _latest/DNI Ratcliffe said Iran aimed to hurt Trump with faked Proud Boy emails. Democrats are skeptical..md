<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">A chorus of Democrats, though, have pushed back on that last claim, noting the threatening emails were sent to registered Democrats in swing states and instructed them to vote for Trump &#8220;or we will come after you.&#8221; </p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Given the emails&#8217; targets and the demand to vote for Trump, Democratic leaders questioned why Ratcliffe characterized the interference as an attack on the president&#8217;s reelection campaign rather than an attempt to inspire confusion and distrust of the entire 2020 election.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;These election interference operations are clearly not meant to harm President Trump,&#8221; the House Homeland Security Committee, which is chaired by Rep.

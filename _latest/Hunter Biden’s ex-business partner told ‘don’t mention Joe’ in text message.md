<div><p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Hunter Biden&#8217;s ex-business partner Tony Bobulinski was warned &#8220;don&#8217;t mention Joe&#8221; in a 2017 text exchange which emerged following <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/22/hunter-biz-partner-confirms-e-mail-details-joe-bidens-push-to-make-millions-from-china/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bobulinski&#8217;s bombshell statement</a> to The Post that former vice president Joe Biden was involved in his family&#8217;s plot to make millions in Communist China.</p>
<p>The messages, obtained by Fox News on Thursday, purportedly shows Bobulinski being instructed by James Gilliar, another key player in the alleged scheme, not to make any mention of the former veep&#8217;s involvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention Joe being involved, it&#8217;s only when u [sic] are face to face, I know u [sic] know that but they are paranoid,&#8221; a <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeEmanuelFox/status/1319280974044131328/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screenshot of the message</a> shared by Fox News&#8217; chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reads.</p>
 
<p>In a lengthy statement to The Post&#8217;s Michael Goodwin, Bobulinski addressed a May 13, 2017, email <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/">published last week</a> that revealed how Hunter Biden pursued lucrative deals with a Chinese energy company and wanted to hold 10 percent of profits for &#8220;the big guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobulinski specifically confirmed that &#8220;the big guy&#8221; was Joe Biden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunter Biden called his dad &#8220;the Big Guy&#8221; or &#8220;my Chairman,&#8221; and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,&#8221; he said in the devastating statement.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I&#8217;ve seen firsthand that that&#8217;s not true, because it wasn&#8217;t just Hunter&#8217;s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line,&#8221; he went on.</p>

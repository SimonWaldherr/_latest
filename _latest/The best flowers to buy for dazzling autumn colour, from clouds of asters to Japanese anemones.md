Perhaps it’s because I was born on Bonfire Night that I love this time of year in the garden. I am a child of autumn with its smoke, low warm light and wind on arms enlivening the senses. The artist in me, though, isn’t ready to let go of the ­colours of summer, and in gardens I ramp up the beauty with some carefully selected floral fireworks.

When all around me leaves are falling and gardens look tired, longing for winter, our garden burns strongest with an abundance of dahlias, persicarias and salvias. The further into autumn we coast the greater the disparity and intensity of colour. In a good year here in mild London I’ve even had dahlias and salvias clinging to flowers on New Year’s Day.

This juxtaposition of a garden in its prime against a world that’s shutting down never looks out of place to me. Perhaps because the colours all become deeper in the muted light, everything a dusky swirl of Moroccan spice. It reminds me of paints splattered against dark wooden palettes and floorboards of the dingy atelier I used to paint in.

Autumn is one of the best times in the garden with the right choice of plants, extending the season by a month or two. Plan for autumn and every other season will fall into place, now being the perfect time to buy autumn plants at their best from nurseries and to sow seeds of others ready for next year.

Judges will be told what constitutes "inhuman or degrading treatment", under plans being considered by Priti Patel to curb the use of human rights laws to block deportations.

The Home Office is drawing up a legal definition intended to restrict the ability of judges to make "subjective" decisions about the conditions potential deportees would face in foreign countries.

Under the plans, the Government's Fair Borders Bill would define "inhuman" or "degrading", in cases in which foreign criminals or failed asylum seekers say they would suffer from such treatment if they were deported to a foreign country.

Article Three of the European Convention on Human Rights states: "No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."

Senior Tories say the clause derived from horrors perpetrated by the Nazis during the Second World War, and has since been interpreted too widely by judges, and abused by those seeking to avoid deportation from the UK.

The move comes after Ms Patel warned of "legal and practical problems" with the "broken" asylum system.

In her Conservative Party conference speech earlier this month, the Home Secretary pledged to introduce a new system that was "firm but fair", stating: "We will stop the abuse of the system ... we will stop those who come here illegally making endless legal claims to remain in our country at the expense of the British public ... we will expedite the removal of those who have no legitimate claim for protection."

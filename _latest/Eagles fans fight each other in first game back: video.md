<div><p>A fight broke out in the stands as the Eagles welcomed fans into their stadium Sunday for the first time this season, video shows.</p>
<p>Multiple men in Eagles gear were seen throwing punches at each other in the upper section of the stadium as the team&#8217;s fight song, &#8220;Fly, Eagles Fly,&#8221; played in the background.</p>
<p>It was unclear what sparked the altercation, which seemed to end when the men were separated by other fans after about 19 seconds, according to video shared online.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Police Department and Eagles did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Known for their raucous fan base, the Eagles were one of several NFL teams that permitted some fans into their stadiums Sunday for the first time this season, as games up to that point had largely been played in front of empty seats due to safety concerns over the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is allowing into Lincoln Financial Field up to 7,500 people, which includes players, team personnel, fans and media members, though it is unclear whether Sunday&#8217;s skirmish would change plans moving forward.</p>
<p>The stadium has a seating capacity of just over 69,000 people.</p>
<p>On the field, the Eagles fell to the Ravens, 30-28.</p>

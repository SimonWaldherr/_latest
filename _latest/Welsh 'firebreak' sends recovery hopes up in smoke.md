<div><p>Pubs and restaurants finally opened indoors a month after<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/04/super-saturday-pictures-lockdown-ends-pubs-reopen/"> their &#8220;Super Saturday&#8221; counterparts in England,</a> on Aug&#160;3. The Welsh Assembly is also sticking more closely to the 2m rule, which was loosened at Westminster as far back as the end of June. Wales has the &#8220;rule of six&#8221; like England, but it is stricter across the border: the six must be drawn from extended households.</p>
<p>Simon Wright, a restaurateur representing some 300 independent eateries in Wales through the newly formed Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, reckons some 12,000 of 60,000 jobs in his sector have already gone.</p>
<p>Wright has been at the sharp end as trading is at around 25pc of pre-Covid levels at his restaurant in Carmarthenshire, and he has made the &#8220;heart-breaking&#8221; decision to let half his staff go.</p>
<p>&#8220;This lockdown is sort of illusory in that we have been in a virtual lockdown for months. Restrictions piled on restrictions have ground down our customer base. It is like strangulation,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In the context of the wider UK economy, the shuttering of Wales will have little effect. The principality has a population of 3.1m &#8211; around a third of the size of London &#8211; and accounts for just 3.4pc of overall gross domestic product, or around &#163;75bn.</p>
<p>The impact on growth will therefore be &#8220;modest&#8221; according to Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg. If Welsh output were to fall by 10pc in the next fortnight, that would translate into just 0.3 percentage points shaved off national output over the period, and a de minimis effect on the quarterly figures. Just 195,000 jobs in Wales were put into the Government furlough as of July 31.</p>
<p>Unemployment of just 3.9pc so far during the crisis, compared to a national average of 4.5pc, is also a reflection of Wales&#8217;s bigger share of production in its economy. Services &#8211;&#160;where much of the pain has been felt from&#160;Covid-19 &#8211;accounts for 71pc of Welsh output, compared with 80pc in the UK, according to 2018 figures.</p>
<p>Overall production amounts to 14pc of UK output; in Wales the share is 22pc thanks to the presence of manufacturing bases such as the UK&#8217;s biggest steelworks in Port Talbot, owned by Indian conglomerate Tata Steel.</p>

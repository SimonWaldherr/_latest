<p>Tesla has begun releasing a beta version of its long-awaited "full self-driving" software, CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday, while providing little clarity about its functionality.</p><p>"FSD beta rollout happening tonight," Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1318678258339221505">said</a> on Twitter on the <a href="http://businessinsider.com/tesla-earnings-report-what-wall-street-analysts-expect-third-quarter-2020-10">eve of Tesla's third-quarter earnings report.</a> "Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should."</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The release, even in a beta version to a limited number of customers, has been years in the making. At a September event, Musk teased the release, saying the update is a "hell of a step change." It could be the final step in his long-promised autonomous coast-to-coast demo <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-may-delay-la-ny-self-driving-demo-2017-8">that was supposed to happen in 2017.&#160;</a></p><p>"We had to rewrite everything," he continued, "labeling software, just the entire code base, it took us quite a while. I call it like 4D in the sense that it's 3 dimensions plus time."</p>

<p>"Full self-driving" has long been an add-on option for Tesla customers as part of its autopilot suite of driver-assistance features, even as both names have taken heat as misleading and potentially dangerous.</p><p>Despite Tesla's own warnings for drivers to pay constant attention while using Autopilot, the system's been blamed for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drivers-sleeping-in-tesla-cars-autopilot-asleep-while-driving-videos-2019-12">spate</a> of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-s-autopilot-crash-police-car-driver-watching-movie-2020-8">accidents</a>, sometimes <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/feds-will-investigate-deadly-tesla-crash-in-california-2020-1">fatal</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-driver-charged-appearing-sleeping-on-autopilot-canada-2020-9">many</a> a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-autopilot-mistakes-burger-king-stop-sign-new-ad-2020-6">viral</a> <a href="http://static1.businessinsider.com/couple-shot-porno-in-moving-tesla-on-autopilot-2019-5">video</a> filmed without someone in the driver's seat. All the while, Tesla has flaunted safety norms undertaken by competitors in the field.</p><p>"All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go," Tesla's website says of full self-driving, a bold claim that no company &#8212; not even Tesla &#8212; has successfully proven can be done safely.</p><p>Nearly ever other self-driving company, from automakers to car startups, have long said their rollout will be slow, measured, and tested. Five companies &#8212; Waymo, Cruise, Nuro, Zoox, and AutoX &#8212; have received permission in California to test without backup drivers.</p>

<p>Those competitors also notably rely on Lidar, a radar technology with more capabilities than cameras alone. Musk has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/">long shunned Lidar,</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1314265240268402691">called</a> Waymo's technology a "highly specialized solution" compared to Tesla's "general solution" that's "capable of zero intervention drives."</p><p>Waymo's John Krafcik hit back subtly, saying "truly autonomous driving machines have warning labels aligned with their capabilities."</p>

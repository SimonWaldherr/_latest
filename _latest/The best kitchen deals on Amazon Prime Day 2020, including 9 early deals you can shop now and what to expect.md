Amazon Prime Day 2020 is just a few days away, and we're predicting a slew of great kitchen deals — from deep discounts on cookware basics to some of the season's best bargains on countertop appliances.

While many deals are kept under wraps until Prime Day kicks off on October 13, Amazon has a few early Prime Day deals you can shop now and the online retailer recently released a sneak peek of upcoming discounts on big kitchen brands like Cuisinart, Instant Pot, Le Creuset, Pyrex, and more.

Last year we saw additional deals on big-ticket items like KitchenAid stand mixers, Crock-Pots, and Keurig coffee makers. And the deals don't end with Amazon — competing retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Target are offering steep discounts to coincide with Amazon's Prime Day.

Amazon Prime Day is a perk exclusively for Prime members. If you're looking to shop Prime Day deals, we suggest signing up for a free 30-day trial now, so you can access the exclusive event for free.

Early Prime Day kitchen deals to shop now:

With so many other retailers offering competitive pricing and Prime Day-adjacent sales, we've rounded up the best early kitchen deals you can find on Amazon and other stores like Walmart.

When is Prime Day?

Amazon Prime Day 2020 will take place on October 13 and 14, but early deals are live now. With this year's event so close in proximity to Black Friday, it just adds to the mass of kitchen discounts we usually see in the fall.

Though Amazon is holding the main event, you can expect worthwhile deals from other retailers like Walmart and Target too, both of which have announced competing concurrent sales. Walmart's Big Save Event will run from October 11-15 and Target's Deal Days is scheduled for October 13-14. Every year, these stores hop on board to offer competitive pricing for Prime Day, which means more options for shoppers.

Retailers like Best Buy are often known to price-match Amazon's Prime Day discounts as well, so if the thing you're looking for has sold out on Amazon, be sure to shop around.

What kitchen deals do we expect?

Small kitchen appliances always dominate Amazon's Prime Day kitchen deals every year. Whether you're looking for an upgrade for your baking setup or a practical gift, appliances like blenders, stand mixers, coffee makers, sous vides, and electric pressure cookers are sure to see deep discounts again, as they did during Prime Day last year.

Amazon announced in a recent press release that we can expect to see savings of up to 40% on kitchen essentials from Corelle, Pyrex, Le Creuset, and more. The retailer also announced discounts of up to 50% off Instant Pots, up to 30% off Cuisinart appliances, and up to 37% off Ninja appliances. Item-specific deals are still to be determined.

We also expect name brands like Nutribullet, OXO, KitchenAid, and Keurig to be at especially low prices for Prime Day, from more than just Amazon — Walmart and Target have always matched those lows in years past.

Larger kitchen appliances don't usually see price drops from this event, so if you're looking for something like a new range, refrigerator, or microwave, you'll probably have to wait for Black Friday to roll around.

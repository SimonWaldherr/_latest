<ol><p class="slideData">4 of 8</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">Credit: AEW</p><p class="">Two of the greatest luchadors of this generation battled in brotherly warfare, advancement in the AEW World Championship Eliminator Tournament at stake, as Lucha Bros' Rey Fenix and Penta El Zero M battled in the third match of the night.</p><p class="">Penta targeted the ankle of his brother early, but that attention was short-lived and gave way to a brutal exchange of chops. A springboard by Fenix earned him a kick to the face mid-flight. Fenix responded by wiping his sibling out. He attempted to run the ropes, but Penta pulled the top rope down, leaving Fenix to crash to the mat below.</p><p class="">Penta controlled the match during the commercial, both in and out of the ring. A missed chop connected with the ring post, allowing Fenix to catch him with a superkick. Penta rocked his brother with one of his own to re-establish his advantage.</p><p class="">A springboard sling blade by Penta impressed even Eddie Kingston on commentary, while a headscissors by Fenix may have stunned himself more than his opponent. Slowed significantly, he still managed to rock his opponent with a superkick for a near-fall.</p><p class="">Fenix delivered a big Spanish Fly from the top rope for another close two-count. Penta caught Fenix in midair and turned him into a powerbomb. Fenix recovered with a destroyer from out of nowhere for the win.</p><p class="">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Result</strong></p><p class="">Fenix defeated Penta</p><p class="">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Grade</strong></p><p class="">A</p><p class="">&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p class="">Fenix and Kenny Omega are going to tear the house down in the semifinals of this tournament.</p><p class="">This was a fantastic bit of business that may have been even better had Fenix not knocked himself a bit loopy midway through.</p><p class="">The athleticism, the creativity and the reversals throughout this were fantastic. The storytelling, with Penta striking the post and hurting his own hand and then going as far as to damage his own brother's arm in the name of winning the match, was low-key great, too.</p><p class="">Everything about this worked and provided the tournament its first great match.</p></ol>

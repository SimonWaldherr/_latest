Despite inquiries by the GOP-led Senate and others, no criminal wrongdoing has been unearthed, and Trump's comments at the first debate about Hunter Biden's past drug use feel flat with what polling showed was an unsympathetic audience.</p><p>The president's attacks on Biden's energy and mental acumen have also not done damage. For all of Trump's "Sleepy Joe'' references and taunts about running a campaign from his Wilmington, Delaware basement, it is Biden whose campaign strategy has kept him ahead in the polls (and COVID-19 free). A <a href="https://election.usc.edu" target="_blank">USC pol</a>l taken after the first debate found that public perception of Trump's physical and mental fitness for office weakened, while Biden's strengthened.</p><p>"This is what happens in the death spiral of a losing campaign. And I've been on both sides of losing campaigns," says Matt Bennett, executive vice president of the centrist Democratic group Third Way.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"It doesn't feel good" to be behind with so little time left, Bennett adds. "Everything you try fails. He is obviously a particularly undisciplined campaigner, but everyone who enters the death spiral starts to panic and try new things, and it never works."</p><p>Trump's efforts to cast Biden as a "socialist" or to divide the Democratic Party by casting him as not liberal enough have also not succeeded: polling shows that while Trump's base may be more devoted to their candidate personally, Biden voters are just as passionate about ousting Trump.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>"Trump is just throwing stuff at the wall" and hoping it sticks, says Mitchell McKinney, director of the<a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUXhB0M268q0kUsTUwOY9juAaMajytB0iENSDradrJa-2FOmk3Y_KMzj71t2G-2F5cwUNtRvcQkEq3WbHzTQAgJt6UCbzFqiKzDGJx99lm31WKnlS4aHAqCkmz9MHE-2B55HSnEhqFtlW1-2BtRc-2BUJys8742IZllX8iE6ODjKRuhgBgbSNwtxPgQaqLZGQeAarVTJTImUGfgzT-2FGAcc6VmQCBaPRPwvqT1xHMDcMzZy4cEWjz-2FkocfrLBazfNMt2TI0LHPe3IwTyhPkbduZOUsr1NZhPUb6Xpn0NLwpgbb51WaTxEH-2BcSGYpgkQjW13iYH9x3rSYA2l1xDjJrZIedpn58odro2-2BzIuXvrs-2FRjrs95IFZRUZoogxRCHebBvMCTzS9pOPJLJkyvEOOnxzRtKH7wWKXYKclcug4-3D" target="_blank"> Political Communication Institute</a> at the University of Missouri. And while similar attacks on Hillary Clinton in 2016 were successful, experts say, the dynamics were different, since Trump was a first time candidate then, and Clinton had low popularity ratings. This year, with the country gripped by the pandemic, civil unrest over racial injustice and high unemployment, it is Trump who is on the defensive.</p><p>Also thwarting Trump's efforts for an October game-changer is that there are fewer potential voters for the president to reach. As of Wednesday night, more than 44 million Americans had already voted early, according to tabulations kept by the nonpartisan <a href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html" target="_blank">U.S. Elections Project</a>.</p><p>That's nearly a third of the entire 2016 voter turnout, and the numbers are even higher in battleground states: in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-2020-swing-states-texas-who-votes-past-results-and-why-it-matters">Texas</a>, early voting turnout is already nearly 60% of the entire 2016 vote in the Lone Star State. In <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-06-23/the-2020-swing-states-arizona-who-votes-past-results-and-why-it-matters">Arizona</a>, 41% of the 2016 vote have already cast ballots; in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-2020-swing-states-florida-who-votes-past-results-and-why-it-matters">Florida</a>, 38% have done so; in North Carolina, 45% of the 2016 vote have cast ballots; in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-2020-swing-states-michigan-who-votes-past-results-and-why-it-matters">Michigan</a>, 37% have turned out already; in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-2020-swing-states-wisconsin-who-votes-past-results-and-why-it-matters">Wisconsin</a>, 35% of the 2016 count have voted; in Georgia, 46% of the 2016 vote have already voted, and in Iowa, 39% have done so.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Those record-setting early voting numbers indicate the president has a much smaller pool of people to reach as he seeks to turn around the campaign narrative. Even if some massive scandal were to emerge in the waning days of the campaign, tens of millions of people cannot change votes they have already cast.</p><p>Potentially worse for Trump, says veteran Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, is that Trump's late-game attacks are undermining him with the very voters he needs to win back &#8211; suburban women.</p><p>If there's a strategy behind Trump's attacks, "the only strategy I can come up with is to try to get non-college educated whites to vote at stratospheric levels," Shrum says. "The problem is one, they're not going to &#8211; they never do. And he's suffered erosion with non-college educated white women who care about things like health care" and don't want to listen to a litany of accusations about purported Biden scandals, Shrum says.</p><p>"He's flailing around," Bennett says. Trump is "convinced that the things that get (Fox News personalities) Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson in a lather are going to work. He's feeding an audience of 3 million people, and he needs to feed an audience of 63 million," closer to the number who might watch the debate Thursday night, Bennett adds.</p><p>Biden's camp believes the race is far closer than public polling indicates, and Trump indeed could win re-election if he gains just a little ground in battleground states. Should Trump lose Wisconsin and Michigan, for example, but hang onto Pennsylvania and every other state the president won in 2016, he would get a second term. But he's running out of time.<br></p></div>

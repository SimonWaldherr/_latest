She displayed her transforming figure in a glamorous scarlet dress with ruched detailing trailing down the centre.

Kate paired the monochromatic look with a red blazer and a designer handbag.

The blonde beauty added height to her frame with a classic pair of black heels and she swept her tresses to the side in a soft wave.

The expecting mother let her pregnancy glow shine through with a soft make-up look.

Last week, Kate posted a sweet drawing with her husband Rio, 41, his sons Lorenz, 14, and Tate, 12, and daughter Tia, nine, as she explained that looking after yourself can be 'a rocky journey.'

In a lengthy post, the blonde wrote to mark Mental Health Awareness Day: 'Mental health is something I have struggled with for as far back as I can remember.

'It can be a rocky journey, and one that we have to take with care, being kind to ourselves can be one of the hardest things to do.

'I just really wanted to say to everyone who is struggling you are not alone. Although we often feel alone and like no one understands, there are many avenues of help available, talking to someone can really lessen the pressure on your shoulders.

'Peoples lives may look a certain way from social media and everything can look perfect but this doesn’t mean they don’t have internal struggles.

'It’s ok to feel overwhelmed and unstable even when everything looks perfect from the outside. Sending you all lots of love and strength today and always.'

Just a few weeks ago, the TV star celebrated her one-year wedding anniversary with former footballer Rio, 41.

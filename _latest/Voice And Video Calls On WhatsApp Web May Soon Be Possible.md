<div><p>If you&#8217;ve wished to take or make calls on <a href="/WHATSAPP">WhatsApp Web</a>, it seems like your prayers will soon be answered. According to a new <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WA_WEB_DECLINE_ACCEPT_CALL.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report </a>by <i>WABetaInfo</i>, voice and video calls for WhatsApp Web are already under development and may soon arrive.</p>

<p>According to the report, the latest update of the WhatsApp web client, v 2.2043.7, has integrated support for WhatsApp voice and video calls. Don&#8217;t scratch your head if you don&#8217;t see support for calls even if you&#8217;re on the same version. The feature is under development and will only be available in the near future.</p>

 
<p>But the folks over at <i>WABetaInfo </i>did get it to work and shared a few screenshots of how this will work. If you receive a call, the client will present you with a floating window wherein you can accept/decline the call. If you make a call, the client will show you a smaller window with information such as time and actions such as end call or mute.</p>

<p>The report says that the Web client will also support group voice and video calls.</p>

<p>Until now, WhatsApp calls and video calls have only been available on Android and iOS. But given that more people than ever are relying on instant messaging services to be in touch - especially due to the pandemic - it&#8217;s good to know that WhatsApp users will soon be able to take and make calls on their laptops or desktops.</p>

<p>All said and done, Facebook-owned WhatsApp hasn&#8217;t officially teased or confirmed whether it&#8217;s planning to roll out this feature anytime soon. The feature is still under development.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the only new feature that may be coming to WhatsApp. We&#8217;ve seen a bunch of other reports in the last few months that reveal upcoming features on the world&#8217;s most popular instant messaging service. <a href="/tech/17177/new-expiring-media-feature-spotted-on-latest-whatsapp-beta-for-android">Expiring media </a>and <a href="/tech/13603/whatsapps-new-multi-device-feature-spotted-in-latest-android-beta-version">multi-device support</a> are just a few of them.</p>

The government has condemned proposals for English football’s biggest overhaul this century as an apparent “backroom deal” that would create a closed shop at the top of the national game.

In a strongly worded statement, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport joined the Premier League and Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) in expressing opposition to a £350 million rescue proposal, authored by Liverpool’s owners with support from Manchester United, that would depend on handing vast new power to a small group of England’s richest clubs.

Public endorsement of the idea by Rick Parry, the English Football League’s chairman, has also caused a major backlash within the Premier League and questions over whether he should now lead future negotiations for a Covid-19 bailout package.

The Premier League said only that it was “disappointed” by Parry’s public statement of support. However, one Premier League source questioned whether clubs could now work with Parry on a rescue plan after he sided with a proposal that, in their view, destroyed the future competitive prospects of teams outside the established ‘big six’.

The veto that the ‘big six’ could effectively organise to other prospective club takeovers, included in a series of highly contentious proposals on ‘special voting rights’, has prompted particular shock. The government has promised a fan-led review of football governance and the FSA are now urging politicians to begin that process without delay.

The Rays didn’t just troll the Yankees by celebrating to Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” after advancing to the ALCS Tuesday night at Petco Park in San Diego

Following the 2-1 victory in Game 5 of the American League Division Series, first baseman Ji-Man Choi appeared to troll Tampa Bay’s next opponent, the Astros, by knocking over and stomping on a recycling bin.

Houston was found to have banged on a garbage can as part of a sign-stealing scheme during their run to the 2017 World Series crown.

While Choi was celebrating, another Yankees-centric song, Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind,” was playing in the background.

The Yankees and Rays had bad blood during the regular season, and it will likely spill over into next season, even if the Yankees didn’t have much to say about the trolling.

“It’s their celebration,” Gerrit Cole said when asked about the Rays playing the songs.

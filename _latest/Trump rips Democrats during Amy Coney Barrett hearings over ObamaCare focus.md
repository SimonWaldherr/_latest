President Trump hit back at Senate Democrats after watching them spend much of Monday morning’s confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court focused on ObamaCare.

“We will have Healthcare which is FAR BETTER than ObamaCare, at a FAR LOWER COST — BIG PREMIUM REDUCTION. PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE PROTECTED AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL THAN NOW,” the commander-in-chief wrote in the first of two tweets.

“HIGHLY UNPOPULAR AND UNFAIR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ALREADY TERMINATED,” the first tweet, written in mostly capital letters, continued.

The president then turned his attention to his GOP colleagues, writing in his second tweet, “Republicans must state loudly and clearly that WE are going to provide much better Healthcare at a much lower cost.”

“Get the word out! Will always protect pre-existing conditions!” he closed.

Trump was responding to the 10 Democratic lawmakers who occupy the minority side of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who focused their attention on the current legal challenge facing the Affordable Care Act that will be taken up by the court just one week after the election.

His tweets came during a break in the hearings, which are expected to last four days.

Democrats have made the ACA a core focus of their opposition to Barrett’s nomination to the bench, especially in their opening statements.

Throughout the hearing, committee Democrats sat in front of photos from their home states of constituents who would be impacted by changes to the landmark health care law.

<div><p>Wolves had earned the huge slice of luck needed for Raul Jimenez&#8217;s winner after turning this game around with rope-a-dope tactics to beat a Marcelo Bielsa team.&#160;</p>
<p>They looked overrun at times in the first half, dominated by Bielsa&#8217;s high-energy game that created chances but not goals. Then as Leeds&#8217; energy ran down, Raul provided the sucker punch. &#160;</p>
<p>Looking like a Portugal international in his maroon and green kit, Raul went on a run Cristiano Ronaldo would be happy with. The Mexican glided around two players towards the edge of the penalty area but his finish was pure good fortune. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Kalvin Phillips stuck his head out and Raul&#8217;s seemingly-harmless shot was diverted into the net, sending Wolves into the top six after a tactical battle between Nuno Espirito Santo and Bielsa.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all Premier League games there is a battle with tactics but after that it is about players,&#8221; Nuno said. &#8220;They are an amazing team with their energy. In terms of fitness and energy we were much better than before. We had chances before and after the goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It's about the identity. We have to recognise that we needed to be organised to stay in the game and then the character was evident.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Nuno admitted afterwards that he looked to use a diagonal ball to Leeds&#8217; left-back area, bypassing the crowded midfield where the hosts had assumed control of the game. It was more direct and had Bielsa&#8217;s players on the back foot.&#160;</p>
<p>It meant Leeds missed out on the victory that would have seen them return to the Champions League places for the first time in 18 years. It was back in September 2002 when they were last there, in a team that contained Harry Kewell, Alan Smith and Mark Viduka. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Bielsa was also dealt a blow just before kick-off when Liam Cooper was injured in the warm-up and pulled out of the game. The Leeds captain felt his groin and after consultation with medical staff headed down the tunnel as his team-mates went through their pre-match routine.&#160;</p>
<p>Still, the hosts looked like they would record a third victory of the campaign with the chances they made.&#160;</p>
<p>Patrick Bamford, in front of watching Gareth Southgate, had the first chances of the game, stabbing wide after a nod down from Rodrigo Moreno and getting a header chalked off for offside.&#160;</p>
<p>David Coote was the VAR referee at the centre of controversy last weekend over Virgil van Dijk getting a serious injury and Jordan Pickford going unpunished. Here he was on the pitch as the man in the middle and he had a big call to make when Helder Costa went over in the penalty area. He initiated contact with Joao Moutinho but Coote deemed there not enough to award a penalty.&#160;</p>
<p>Leeds also had one chance cleared off the line while Costa dragged a shot wide, and they were made to pay for wasting their chances.&#160;</p>

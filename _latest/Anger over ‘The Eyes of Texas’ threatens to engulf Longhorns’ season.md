AUSTIN, Texas -- Things have somehow reached a point where Texas coach Tom Herman started his weekly press conference Monday by reading a statement about the school song. It’s a nuclear bomb that nobody at Texas can disarm.

“I do want to address something I know that continues to be a point of conversation out there, which is ‘The Eyes of Texas,’” Herman said.

Fan anger about the players’ desire to get rid of “The Eyes” was already boiling. The pot spilled over Saturday when quarterback Sam Ehlinger was standing front and center, all by himself, with his Horns up after a four-overtime loss to Oklahoma.

The fact that Herman led his press conference with “The Eyes” shows it trumps anything to do with his 2-2, unranked football team. Going forward, Herman will “encourage” players to stay on the field after games but it will not be mandatory.

A few other players remained on the field Saturday. But dozens of photos taken from the stands posted online show only one — the senior who accounted for six touchdowns in a five-hour loss — standing up for school pride. The rest of the team had already left the Cotton Bowl field.

“There are very strong emotions on both sides,” Herman said. “And this is something we’ve been working through since our campus initiatives were announced back in July.”

As part of Herman’s prepared text, the coach noted that Texas President Jay Hartzell asked professor Richard Reddick to chair a committee that will compile an official school history of the song. The committee is expected to complete its work by January.

The song was written in 1903 and meant as a comical jab at the school president at the time. William Lambdin Prather learned the phrase “The eyes of the South are upon you” from Robert E. Lee, turning the phrase into “The eyes of Texas are upon you” as UT’s president.

Students created a satirical song using the tune “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad,” a Black work dating to 1894. At Texas, this new version was later performed by white singers in blackface at minstrel shows. Over time, it became UT’s school song.

This summer, Texas players from multiple sports sent a list of requests to school leaders that addressed the school’s racial past. Almost all of the requests were accepted — but the school wasn’t changing “The Eyes of Texas.” Several football players later said they would not sing it, and it was decided they no longer had to stay on the field for it, either.

The Texas volleyball and soccer teams initially did not acknowledge “The Eyes” at their events. Last week, volleyball players stood shoulder to shoulder while the song was played over the loudspeaker.

“I’ve encouraged our staff and team to join me in participating after games, if they are comfortable doing that,” Herman said while reading his text. “I do believe it’s important that we acknowledge and thank our fans after a hard fought game.”

Of those who stayed after the Oklahoma game, Herman said, “I applaud them and respect that.”

“That said, some members of our program have concerns and aren’t comfortable participating at this time, and I respect that as well,” Herman said. “This is an issue that we will continue to have meaningful conversations about and work through as campus committee gathers more information and addresses it. These findings will allow us to continue our conversations about ‘The Eyes of Texas’ moving forward.”

Asked if there is a compromise to be had, like getting the players to stay on the field after games, Herman referred to his statement.

“Again, I put a lot of thought into the words that I said to open up the press conference,” Herman said. “I know our leadership, both at a university level and an athletic department level, is working very hard on that. And we will follow their lead on wherever that takes us.”

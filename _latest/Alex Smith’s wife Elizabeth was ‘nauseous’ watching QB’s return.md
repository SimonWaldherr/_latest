Alex Smith’s wife Elizabeth experienced a range of emotions Sunday as the quarterback returned to the field for the first time in two years since his devastating leg injury.

Speaking after Washington’s 30-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, Elizabeth reflected on Smith’s game-day action at FedEx Field after he entered the game in the second quarter after Kyle Allen took a helmet-to-helmet hit.

“Well obviously fear, instantly. Nauseous. Not knowing what to expect,” she said, according to Washington, D.C.’s ABC affiliate. “He’s worked so hard to get to this point, even to just put a uniform on. Overwhelming amount of pride for him. So proud. He has surpassed anything anyone ever thought he’d be able to do and here we are.”

Smith completed 9 of 17 pass attempts on Sunday, almost two years after the 36-year-old quarterback broke the tibia and fibula in his right leg. At the time, Smith also contracted sepsis and fought for his life, nearly losing his leg. He has undergone 17 surgeries.

“Just for him to be able to come to this point, we were at a place where we didn’t know if he would be able to walk again, live, all these things,” Elizabeth said. “Really special and I’m really glad that we were able to be here.”

Elizabeth, who has been married to Smith since 2009, also reflected on the first hit he took, which consisted of Aaron Donald grabbing him from behind then hopping on his back to complete the sack.

“Knowing Alex, I know he got the adrenaline and was like, ‘Finally got that first hit.’ He kept saying, ‘I just need to take one hit, need to take one hit,’ just to feel that little boost of confidence,” she said.

With an NFC East showdown against the New York Giants looming, Elizabeth said Alex is taking it a step at a time, a goal at a time.

“Alex sets goals in front of him and it’s always just knocking down the next one,” she said. “Alex is going to keep pushing through until he can get himself back to winning football games.

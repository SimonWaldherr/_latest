  Hawa Abdi, doctor who saved thousands of lives in wartorn Somalia – obituary 
description: > 
  Hawa Abdi, who has died aged 73, was a pioneering Somali doctor whose one-room clinic grew into a 400-bed hospital; she provided sanctuary to 90,000 displaced people during her country’s brutal civil war, offering life-saving treatment to malnourished children while facing down marauding militiamen.When families of refugees started turning up at her door, she sold her family gold to buy bags of sorghum to feed them.She refused to turn those in her care over to gunmen from rival clans and was once beaten with a rifle after rescuing one of her nurses.“Our only security were two guards and our band of boys – eight, 10 and 12 years old,” she later wrote.“They were the first ones to hear the crackle of gunfire in the distance or the sound of a car cascading into the area, its light and motor off as a way to be undetected: someone coming to us in search of money, of food, of children to rape.”

Hawa Abdi, who has died aged 73, was a pioneering Somali doctor whose one-room clinic grew into a 400-bed hospital; she provided sanctuary to 90,000 displaced people during her country’s brutal civil war, offering life-saving treatment to malnourished children while facing down marauding militiamen.

When families of refugees started turning up at her door, she sold her family gold to buy bags of sorghum to feed them. She refused to turn those in her care over to gunmen from rival clans and was once beaten with a rifle after rescuing one of her nurses.

“Our only security were two guards and our band of boys – eight, 10 and 12 years old,” she later wrote. “They were the first ones to hear the crackle of gunfire in the distance or the sound of a car cascading into the area, its light and motor off as a way to be undetected: someone coming to us in search of money, of food, of children to rape.”

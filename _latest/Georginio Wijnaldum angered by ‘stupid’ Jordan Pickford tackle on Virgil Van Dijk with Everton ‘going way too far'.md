  Georginio Wijnaldum angered by ‘stupid’ Jordan Pickford tackle on Virgil Van Dijk with Everton ‘going way too far' 
description: > 
  Van Dijk requires surgery on knee ligament damage sustained when the England goalkeeper launched a knee-high challenge at him during the 2-2 draw at Goodison Park.Pickford escaped punishment due to apparent confusion over VAR rules - official David Coote had already ruled Van Dijk was offside - and that has only compounded Liverpool's anger."I believe he didn't want to injure Virgil the way he injured him but the way he took the tackle, basically he didn't care about what happened after the tackle.The loss of Van Dijk, who played for all but 35 minutes of two full Premier League seasons, is still quite raw for the Liverpool squad."We were pretty high in both tables which means you can play football without these types of challenges."

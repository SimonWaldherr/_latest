Premier League clubs are set for a momentous day as they discuss the Project Big Picture proposals that could change the landscape of English football for the first time.

Liverpool and Manchester United, as well as EFL chairman Rick Parry, are behind a radical restructure to the Premier League that would bring increased funding for the EFL, reduce the top flight from 20 to 18 clubs and scrap the Carabao Cup among other things.

But the proposal also outlines how the Premier League's 'Big Six' would acquire more power in decision-making and that has caused anger within the top flight and other areas of the football pyramid.

Manchester United's Joel Glazer is also behind the plans that would re-shape English football

Premier League clubs will air the views on the matter in an online video conference on Wednesday morning.

Currently, at least 14 of the Premier League's 20 clubs need to vote in favour of any major proposals in order for them to be introduced.

But it is thought that at least eight clubs are against the plan, including Brighton, Burnley, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Sheffield United and West Brom.

It emerged on Tuesday night that EFL clubs are split over whether to support the plan with meetings of the three divisions involving all 72 clubs held on Tuesday ending without a firm agreement.

As reported by Sportsmail, Championship clubs are understood to have offered chairman Parry their support while clubs in League One and League Two were far more critical of the proposals.

There are fears the Premier League's clear anger at Parry's involvement in secret talks with Liverpool and Manchester United could jeopardise the bailout they are seeking to survive for the rest of the season.

As many as seven clubs in League One and Two need extra funding to ensure they can pay all their players this month so are wary of further antagonising the Premier League.

In a letter to the FA Council, which convenes on Thursday, FA chairman Greg Clarke said he had taken part in initial discussions before walking away when he felt the aim had become 'the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few clubs, with a breakaway league mooted as a threat'.

He wrote: 'I, of course, discontinued my involvement and counselled a more consensus-based approach involving all Premier League clubs and its chair and CEO. Our game needs to continually seek to improve but benefits need to be shared.'

Clarke warned that the FA could use its so-called 'golden share' as a trump card if it felt the wider interests of the game were being compromised and suggested any breakaway competition would not receive the necessary sanctions from the governing body.

'We, the FA Board and Council, have to ensure that any changes would be to the long-term benefit of the whole of football and we have substantial controls to help ensure that the best interests of the game are served by any new proposals,' he said.

'Change must benefit clubs, fans and players, not just selective balance sheets. In these difficult times unity, transparency and common purpose must override the interests of the few.'

The Football Supporters' Association have taken an altogether more sceptical view, deeming PBP a 'sugar-coated cyanide pill offered up by billionaire owners who do not understand or care about our football culture'.

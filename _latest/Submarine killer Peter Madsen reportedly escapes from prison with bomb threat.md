<div><p>The Danish inventor who was convicted of <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/04/25/danish-inventor-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-killing-journalist/">torturing and murdering a Swedish journalist</a> in a self-built submarine in 2017 escaped Tuesday from the prison where he is serving a life sentence&#160; &#8212; but was quickly recaptured after a standoff with snipers.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/09/danish-convicted-submarine-killer-admits-to-murdering-kim-wall/">Peter Madsen</a> was seen in dramatic <a href="https://ekstrabladet.dk/112/peter-madsen-i-flugtaktion/8334161" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video posted by the tabloid Ekstra Bladet</a> surrounded by heavily armed police as he sat with his hands behind his back on a grassy patch at the side of a road in Albertslund.</p>
<p>A reporter with the outlet reported that he was wearing a belt-like device around his waist. Members of the bomb squad also responded to the scene.</p>
<p>Madsen reportedly took a hostage inside the prison and threatened the person with what appeared to be a firearm, local media reported, adding that he stopped less than a half-mile from the prison.</p>
<p>A witness, Frank Jensen, told the outlet that police suddenly surrounded a white van outside the Herstedvester prison in suburban Copenhagen, opened the door and pulled Madsen out.</p>
<p>Madsen had been kept in isolation amid concerns that he would try to escape from the lockup, according to reports Tuesday.</p>

 
	<p>In a recent interview for a documentary, the 49-year-old admitted to the crime for the first time, answering &#8220;yes&#8221; when asked whether he had killed Kim Wall in August 2017 after he invited her on board his 60-foot UC3 Nautilus for an interview.</p>
 
<p>Wall was last seen waving to her boyfriend after boarding the vessel to report on a story about Madsen, well known in Denmark for raising money to build rockets and subs.</p>
<p>Her dismembered torso was found days later at sea off Copenhagen and other body parts were found in weighted bags in October.</p>
<p>Madsen had admitted to dismembering Wall but his story flip-flopped as to how she died. On the stand, he claimed the journalist died from breathing toxic fumes that had built up in the sub.</p>
<p>During the trial, prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen accused Madsen of torturing Wall as part of his violent sexual fantasies.</p>
<p>In 2018, Madsen was sentenced to life in prison and lost his appeal shortly after apologizing to the victim&#8217;s family members, who were present in the appeals court.</p>
<p>Wall had planned to interview Madsen for a story on a rocket program he founded with the goal of building a crowdfunded projectile to launch himself into space. But by the time he finally texted her, his cash flow had dried up and he had canceled the effort.</p>

<div><p>A Florida couple died in a suspected murder-suicide described by one cop as the &#8220;most gruesome crime scene I&#8217;ve ever worked,&#8221; according to reports.</p>
<p>Sabrina Marie Dumdei, 37, and Zachary John Winton, 34, were found dead Saturday afternoon when Dumdei&#8217;s father went to check on her at the apartment complex on Anna Marie Island, <a href="https://www.mysuncoast.com/2020/10/18/investigation-underway-after-police-say-two-dead-bodies-were-found-home-anna-maria-island/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news station WWSB reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Dumdei&#8217;s father] came to the house and noticed that she was on the floor,&#8221; Bradenton Beach Police Chief Sam Speciale<a href="https://www.amisun.com/2020/10/18/possible-murder-suicide-under-investigation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> told the Anna Maria Island Sun</a>. &#8220;He broke a door window to gain entry and found her on the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The couple was pronounced dead at the scene and autopsies were ordered to determine more about what led to the fatal incident, the outlet reported.</p>
<p>Sgt. Lenard Diaz, who is leading the investigation, said it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear what caused the couple&#8217;s injuries.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;We have no idea. All I can tell you is there&#8217;s a lot of blood,&#8221; Diaz told the paper.</p>
<p>Blood could be seen splattered on the glass sliding door of the home and there was a bloodstained plastic chair on the balcony, the outlet reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is probably the most gruesome crime scene I&#8217;ve ever worked &#8212; the worst in 37 years that I&#8217;ve ever seen,&#8221; Diaz said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be really hard to put together what occurred, what the chronological events were that led up to the actual deaths.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said there had been previous reports of domestic violence at the home.</p>
<p>Dumdei was arrested in July after she allegedly hurled a can at Winton, but the charges were later dropped, the paper reported.</p>
<p>Then Winton was ordered to have no contact with Dumdei after he was arrested Aug. 29 at the home on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, tampering with a witness, false imprisonment, and domestic battery, <a href="https://www.bradenton.com/news/local/crime/article246543863.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Bradenton Herald reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will kill her. She gonna pay,&#8221; Winton allegedly said while under arrest. &#8220;If I get charged with felonies, I&#8217;ll kill her then myself. I will cut her throat.&#8221;</p>

 
	<p>The no-contact order was lifted last month after his attorney argued that he had never previously been charged with a felony and had no history of physical violence, but the case remained open at the time of their deaths, the Anna Maria Island Sun reported.</p>

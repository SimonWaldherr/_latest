EA Sports announced Thursday two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and his brothers, Milwaukee Bucks teammate Thanasis Antetokounmpo and Kostas Antetokounmpo of the Los Angeles Lakers, are being added to Madden NFL 21 as part of an NBA crossover.

All three Antetokounmpo brothers will be playable characters in "The Yard," a new mode inspired by backyard football, and Giannis will also be available in the video game's "Superstar KO."

Gamers can deck out the brothers in custom gear aimed at celebrating the family's Greek heritage for when they take the field in The Yard.

They are the first NBA players to ever appear in the storied Madden franchise.

It's not the first time EA Sports has utilized a crossover, though.

<div><p>Samuel Paty, killed last week outside his school, will be awarded Legion d&#8217;Honneur</p><p>Samuel Paty, the 47-year old history teacher beheaded last week by a suspected Islamist, will be posthumously given France&#8217;s highest award, the Legion d&#8217;Honneur, the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has said.</p>
<p>Paty was killed on Friday outside his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old of Chechen origin. Police shot the attacker dead.</p>
<p>The teenager sought to avenge his victim&#8217;s use of caricatures of the prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of expression. Muslims believe that any depiction of the prophet is blasphemous.</p>
<p>Paty&#8217;s killing shocked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france" class="u-underline">France</a>, and carried echoes of the attack five years ago on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Public figures called it an attack on the Republic and on French values.</p>
<p>A national ceremony in honour of Paty will be held at the Sorbonne university in Paris on Wednesday.</p>

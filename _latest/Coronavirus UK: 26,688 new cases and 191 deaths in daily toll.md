But they are still a far-cry from the true numbers seen during the peak of the first wave in the spring, when at least 100,000 Britons were catching the illness every day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Deaths are also rising in line with the nation's growing outbreak, with today's figure a 40 per cent rise on the 137 laboratory-confirmed fatalities added to the UK's official toll exactly a week ago. Health chiefs yesterday posted 241 more victims, in the darkest day of Britain's Covid-19 crisis since the start of June.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The figures come as Professor John Edmunds, an epidemiologist based at the <a href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-f25b7990-1398-11eb-b780-cddc462db334">London</a> School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and member of Number 10's scientific advisory panel, told MPs that the three-tier lockdown system will only slow down the outbreak and not shrink it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ultimate outcome, he said, can only be stabilised 'high incidence everywhere' because 'nobody expects' the policies to bring the reproduction rate (R) in crisis-hit areas below one. If the R stays at one or above the epidemic will never shrink and Professor Edmunds warned the policy would just lead to constant pressure on hospitals and regular deaths.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The scientist, who has already called for at least one 'circuit breaker' lockdown for the whole UK and repeated his support for one in front of MPs today, claimed the Government is 'not being as cautious as I would like'.&#160;He said England is already at the point where the NHS in the North will be under immense strain in the coming weeks, and warned he doesn't see a way out of the current situation without 'deaths in the tens of thousands'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Official data shows, however, that infection rates are already coming down in many parts of England. A PHE report last week revealed almost a third of local authorities in the country &#8211; 41 out of 149 &#8211; saw per-person infection rates drop in the week ending October, up from only two that had a downward trend the week before. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer, yesterday showed heat maps of the country with&#160;'more patches of green' than the week before, indicating a larger number of places have shrinking outbreaks.</p><img id="i-b4b9e4fc6193b83d" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="532" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-b4b9e4fc6193b83d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/17/34670902-8863559-image-m-61_1603296739835.jpg" height="532" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-5d4ba2aa7b6e9471" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="573" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-5d4ba2aa7b6e9471" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/17/34671274-8863559-image-a-1_1603297108960.jpg" height="573" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Boris Johnson once again stuck to his 'tiers' system today and dismissed the idea of a 'circuit breaker'&#8212; which is backed by Labour and has already been implemented in different forms in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales &#8212; saying: 'It would involve closing schools, it would involve shuttering businesses with all the psychological, emotional damage that lockdown of that kind brings.'&#160;</p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">LABOUR'S DEPUTY ACCUSED OF CALLING TORY MP 'SCUM' IN COMMONS</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner was today accused of calling a Tory MP 'scum' after he claimed members of the opposition frontbench view coronavirus as a 'good crisis'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The clash between Ms Rayner and Conservative backbencher Chris Clarkson happened during an opposition day debate in the Commons this afternoon as MPs debated funding for areas facing additional coronavirus restrictions.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Clarkson suggested senior Labour figures viewed the current outbreak as an opportunity to be exploited.</p><img id="i-5afc7c3da112fea5" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="232" width="211" alt="Angela Rayner" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-5afc7c3da112fea5" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/17/34667004-8863559-Angela_Rayner_was_today_accused_of_calling_a_Tory_MP_scum_during-m-9_1603298054837.jpg" height="232" width="211" alt="Angela Rayner" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Angela Rayner </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Rayner, who was sat on the frontbench, then appeared to heckle Mr Clarkson who asked her: 'Excuse me, did the honourable lady just call me scum?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The exchange prompted an intervention from a furious Commons Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing who said she would not accept such comments in the chamber 'under any circumstances'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tory MPs immediately demanded an apology and called on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to reprimand Ms Rayner over the alleged remark.</p><p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_1"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

But Mr Johnson said the money would now be 'distributed to the boroughs' instead of going through the mayor's office.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a combative PMQs this afternoon, Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of a 'corrosive and miserly' approach sparking 'local battles'.

The evidence we've all seen is suggestive that hospitality is making a contribution but, more to the point, it's almost a race to the bottom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The evidence is stronger for hospitality than it is for many other non-home settings.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">'We are already at the point where the health service in much of the North will be under strain in the next few weeks,' Professor Edmunds said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Even if we stopped things now, cases and hospitalisations would continue to go up for the next 10 days [or] two weeks because they're already baked into the system. They've already been infected but it will take some time to be hospitalised &#8211; and the same goes for deaths.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think if you look where we are, there's no way we come out of this wave now without counting our deaths in the tens of thousands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If we don't take any additional measures, if we just leave it as it is, then we'll see peaks in the North West probably within the next four to six weeks and then the rest of the country are weeks behind.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So we'll see peaks around Christmas and the New Year of very severe numbers of cases throughout the UK. It's slower and lower in the South West and South East than in the more urban centres...</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That's the sort of thing we're looking at &#8211; very large numbers of cases, hundreds of deaths a day. I don't think it's going to reach the height of the epidemic in March and April &#8211; not quite &#8211; but in many parts it may already be quite similar'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Department of Health data show that the second wave in Britain is continuing to grow, with 21,331 more positive tests announced yesterday, taking the daily average to 18,235.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The deaths of another 241 people were confirmed, a rise of more than two thirds (68.5 per cent) from the same day last week.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Office for National Statistics estimates that around 27,900 people are catching the virus every day in England, its highest prediction since they began in May.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All indicators &#8211; across positive cases, deaths and hospital admissions, are they highest they have been for at least four months.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Edmunds said that he fears the three-tier lockdown system &#8211; introduced this month by Boris Johnson instead of leaning towards national measures &#8211; will not squash the UK's second surge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think we are not being as cautious as I would like us to be,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think it's pretty clear cases have been going up quite fast. What worries me a little bit is where the strategy leads to at the moment.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So the targeted strategy, the tiered strategy, if you think it through &#8211; where that leads to is a high level of incidence everywhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Because let's say that tier three works, and keeps the reproduction number at about one &#8211; I don't think anybody really thinks it's going to reduce it to less than one, so let's assume it manages to get the reproduction number to about one.&#160;</p><img id="i-f0a65a25fe500745" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="542" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f0a65a25fe500745" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/18/34625134-8860631-image-a-28_1603215939460.jpg" height="542" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-e8ed3f5dc1f013e7" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="540" width="960" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-e8ed3f5dc1f013e7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/17/34625150-8863559-image-a-4_1603297766679.jpg" height="540" width="960" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-1ea6502552669d1a" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="542" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-1ea6502552669d1a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/18/34625132-8860631-image-a-26_1603215939449.jpg" height="542" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-5223a5d9ca96bb9" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="540" width="960" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-5223a5d9ca96bb9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/17/34625148-8863559-image-a-3_1603297751279.jpg" height="540" width="960" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">SCOTLAND EXTENDS CIRCUIT BREAKER LOCKDOWN BY A WEEK&#160;</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Nicola Sturgeon today announced pub and restaurant closures across the central belt of Scotland will be extended by a week to November 2 after the country recorded its highest number of coronavirus deaths since May.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The First Minister imposed the closure of hospitality venues in Covid-19 hotspots as well as a 6pm indoor hospitality curfew in other areas earlier this month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rules were originally due to last for two weeks and end on October 26 but Ms Sturgeon said today that the measures will have to be kept in place for longer.</p><img id="i-701f430d071113fd" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="253" width="426" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-701f430d071113fd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/15/34665084-8863559-image-a-26_1603289896699.jpg" height="253" width="426" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said extending the shutdown to November 2 would allow for a 'smooth' transition to a new tiered system of restrictions, scheduled to come into effect on the same date.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The original introduction of the measures prompted hospitality chiefs to warn of a 'death sentence' for hundreds of Scottish venues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Sturgeon made clear she believed the extension of the measures was necessary after Scotland recorded a further 28 Covid-19 deaths and an additional 1,739 cases - the highest number of fatalities since May 21.</p> <p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_3"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">'That means that in Liverpool and Manchester and the North West now, [it] will keep the incidence at this high level, which is putting hospitals under strain and causing significant numbers of deaths, and we're going to keep it at that high level now for the foreseeable future.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And then a few weeks later the Midlands goes into tier three so we then keep the Midlands at a high level of incidence for the foreseeable future, and then London is shortly after.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So what means, by logical extension of this, is that we all end up at a high level of incidence where hospitals are really under stretch and we have large numbers of deaths. So that, for me, is the logical conclusion of this strategy that we're following &#8211; I would not follow that strategy.'&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said that without putting the entire country into the toughest lockdown rules now, the country would be left to face hospitals under strain and large numbers of infections sweeping across the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The incidence of the virus &#8211; the number of people who are newly catching the virus &#8211; would be unlikely to go down during Tier Three lockdowns, he said, but also unlikely to go up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He repeated his earlier calls for a circuit breaker lockdown which could turn back the clock on the outbreak all over the UK, which could then be followed by tighter rules to stop outbreaks getting out of control again.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Edmunds explained: 'If you put the [Tier Three] measures in place the incidence stays roughly the same so the measures are there... to hold the reproduction number, let's say, at about one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But if you go through a circuit breaker first then that would reduce the incidence for a few weeks and maybe, if you do a very stringent one, maybe you can halve the incidence. So instead of holding the incidence at this high level where hospitals are under strain you hold it at a lower level where they're not under such strain. That's one option.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Or you move to Tier Three everywhere now and so places that haven't got to the point where hospitals are under strain, you keep them at that level now to stop them getting there.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Edmunds's comments come as the Government is introducing sweeping new rules this week as it thrusts millions of people in the North of England into Tier Three.</p><img id="i-fc58bb92596d714f" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="572" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-fc58bb92596d714f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/15/34664412-8863559-image-a-32_1603292378169.jpg" height="572" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-2416bb5c74e559a0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="693" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-2416bb5c74e559a0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/15/34665182-8863559-image-a-34_1603292384681.jpg" height="693" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-40371a1e49c71680" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="606" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-40371a1e49c71680" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/11/34619020-8862551-image-a-13_1603275841575.jpg" height="606" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-8086d168d3ce3ad" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="681" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-8086d168d3ce3ad" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/16/34619022-8863559-image-m-37_1603292425782.jpg" height="681" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-c724f8532924e1d1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="720" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-c724f8532924e1d1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/16/34619012-8863559-image-a-39_1603293264395.jpg" height="720" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">BORIS SIDELINES ANDY BURNHAM OVER &#163;60M LOCKDOWN BAILOUT&#160;</h3> <img id="i-94a91f0bf6244520" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="277" width="211" alt="Andy Burnham" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-94a91f0bf6244520" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/16/34630272-8863559-Andy_Burnham-a-29_1603294745905.jpg" height="277" width="211" alt="Andy Burnham" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="clear"></p><p class="imageCaption">A furious blame game erupted between Boris Johnson and Andy Burnham (pictured) after talks over a Tier Three lockdown bailout failed&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boris Johnson moved to sideline Andy Burnham today after their vicious slanging match over Greater Manchester's lockdown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PM insisted he would honour the &#163;60million package of business support for the region he offered to the Labour mayor, even though it was angrily rejected with Mr Burnham accusing the government of dooming people to 'poverty'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mr Johnson said the money would now be 'distributed to the boroughs' instead of going through the mayor's office.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The premier also jibed that he had a 'great conversation' with Sheffield City mayor Dan Jarvis, who today agreed a deal for the region to be escalated to Tier Three from Saturday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">South Yorkshire has secured a &#163;41million deal for contact tracing, enforcement and business support, and Mr Jarvis swiped at Mr Burnham by saying he had acted 'responsibly' in reaching an agreement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alongside a ban on households mixing indoors, pubs and bars will have to shut from midnight on Saturday, as well as betting shops, casinos and soft plays.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, gyms and leisure centres can stay open - with Liverpool also getting their rules eased after a protest at double standards between regions.

Meanwhile it has been confirmed that gyms will remain open in Sheffield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Can I still take place in sports activities outdoors?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes.

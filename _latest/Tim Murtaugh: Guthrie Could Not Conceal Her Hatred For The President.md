</p><p>On Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla, Trump 2020 Director of Communications Tim Murtaugh critiqued Samantha Guthrie's performance as moderator during her town hall with President Trump. </p>
<p>"This was supposed to be a town hall meeting with Savannah Guthrie on NBC last night with the President and the first third of it, twenty minutes worth of it was her trying to make her pals inside the building at NBC feel a little bit better because there was outrage that they would even give the President a town hall for sixty minutes in the first place. So she was probably trying to make it up to everybody and see how vicious she can be. So she was not able to conceal her contempt and her hatred for the President. It came through quite readily. And I think the President handled it masterfully."</p>

<div><p>What decade is it, again?</p>
<p>Bushwick commuters were greeted by a blast-from-the-past Wednesday at the DeKalb Avenue L train stop &#8212; where gigantic graffiti &#8220;tags&#8221; were splashed along platform walls.</p>
<p>The massive red-and-gold, blue-and-red and yellow-and-black spray-paintings appear to be the work of multiple artists.</p>
<p>Nearly a dozen different tags were visible along the station&#8217;s two platforms Wednesday afternoon. An MTA worker there said there had been even more in the morning that had since been cleaned up.</p>
<p>At least one Bushwick resident wasn&#8217;t happy to see the illegal art pieces, which covered everything from advertisements to the historic tiles bearing the station&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t look good. It makes the place look ghetto-type,&#8221; said straphanger Maria Escobar.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to see this. That makes New York worse, if you ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But some riders weren&#8217;t bothered to see the vandalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m shocked, but at the same time it&#8217;s impressive. I think it goes well with the Bushwick community,&#8221; local Angel Mejias told The Post as he waited on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an art community, especially in this area. It goes well with the subway. It represents the art of New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long considered a relic from New York City&#8217;s dark days, subway graffiti has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/25/subway-graffiti-is-making-a-resurgence-in-nyc/">made a resurgence</a> in recent years, The Post reported last December.</p>
<p>But tags in 2020 are rarely seen by the public, since the MTA immediately takes tagged trains out of service until they can be cleaned.</p>

 
	<p>MTA spokesman Shams Tarek said the vandalism was discovered during the 6 a.m. hour on Wednesday. Tarek said the agency wasn&#8217;t able to clean the graffiti during the day, and it will be power-washed before Thursday&#8217;s morning rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a zero tolerance policy for vandalism, which detracts valuable time, resources and taxpayer dollars from the system at a time when the MTA is facing the worst financial crisis in its history,&#8221; Tarek said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working with the NYPD to investigate the matter and our cleaners are working around the clock to restore the wall to its original condition.&#8221;</p>

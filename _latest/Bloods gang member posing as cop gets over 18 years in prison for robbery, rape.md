A Brooklyn man who goes by the nickname “Moneybags” was hit with 18 1/2 years in prison Friday for posing as an NYPD cop to rob a drug dealer then rape the pusher’s sister, officials said.

Devone Jefferys, 28, was convicted at trial of robbery conspiracy, attempted robbery of heroin and cash, and the unlawful use and possession of a firearm for the July 31, 2015, home invasion and rape in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Jefferys, a reputed Bloods gang member, and his co-defendant impersonated police officers when they stormed into the apartment, their guns pointed at a pregnant woman who was in labor and the dealer’s mother and sister.

The duo ordered them to lie on the floor and bound them with duct tape. Jefferys ransacked the apartment searching for drugs and cash, while he and his cohort aimed their guns at the victims’ heads and the pregnant woman’s stomach, authorities said.

After Jefferys realized that the dealer’s sister tossed a bag of heroin out a window, he dragged her outside to an alleyway and raped her, according to federal prosecutors.

“Today’s substantial sentence will protect the community by incapacitating this violent predator, who inflicted injury and terror upon his victims before he was brought to justice,” stated Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme.

U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto handed down the sentence in Brooklyn federal court.

<div><p>Michel Barnier has told&#160;European Parliament he&#160;believes a post-Brexit trade deal is "within reach", despite the UK backing away from talks.</p>
<p>The EU's chief negotiator&#160;promised to intensify&#160;talks on the basis of common legal text and across all subjects.&#160;</p>
<p>"Despite the difficulties we've faced an agreement is within reach, if both sides are willing to work constructively, if both sides are willing to compromise.</p>
<p>"And if we're able to make progress in the next few days on the basis of legal texts. And if we're ready over the next few days to resolve the sticking points, the tricky subjects, because time is of the essence&#160;and time is running out each and every day."</p>
<p>He said both sides must "endeavor to find solutions to the most difficult areas".</p>
<p>Although the EU's attitude "has in no way shifted, and it will not shift, not up until the very last day, not even then," Mr Barnier said he would seek "the necessary compromises on both sides...&#160;right up until the last day that it's possible to do so"</p>
<p>But he added: "There will not be a trade deal without a fair solution for fishermen on both sides and we will insist on this right up until the very end. There needs to be mutual access to waters, and there needs to be a fair distribution of quotas for fishermen on both sides."</p>

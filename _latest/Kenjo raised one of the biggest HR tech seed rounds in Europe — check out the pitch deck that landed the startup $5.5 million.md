<p>COVID-19 has made well-oiled HR more important than ever as employees increasingly work remotely.&#160;</p><p>Technology in human resources has traditionally focused on making life easier for administrators rather than employees, according to Kenjo CEO David Padilla. The rise in remote working could lead to employee dissatisfaction if not dealt with, something he hopes to solve with his HR tech startup which has just raised $5.5 million in fresh funding.&#160;</p><p>"In HR, Covid has meant that remote work comes in which has created new problems around issues like engagement, communication, culture, onboarding, performance, etc," Padilla told Business Insider. "The value proposition for employees didn't exist 10 years ago but the power balance between employee and employer has totally changed. Flexibility, career development, and growth are now key factors."&#160;</p><p>To that end, Kenjo offers a suite of services to small and medium business (up to 1000 employees) across Germany, Spain, and Latin America to help with employee engagement and communication. Kenjo previously raised $1.9 million in seed funding from investors including Wefox CEO Julian Teicke but has now raised what it says is the largest HR tech seed round of the year from N26 backer Redalpine.&#160;</p><p>Covid is helping to fuel a boom in HR tech in what could be a $148 billion market, according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/human-resources-market-map-expert-intelligence/">research from CB Insights</a>. Alongside that is an increased understanding that development goals should be a priority for HR teams. <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/workforce-of-the-future/hr-tech-survey.html">A recent study from PwC</a> found that developing people to reach their full potential and improving the employee experience were among the top applications of technology in their businesses.&#160;</p><p>The fundraising took place over an eight week period between May and July.</p><p>There was "no pressure" to get funding Padilla said, but he added that conversations about accelerating the company's growth plan were the core of the decision.</p><p>"We were already scaling efficiently when we started talking to Redalpine," he said. "We will use this funding to improve our product and tech, in the long term having a great product is an absolute must."&#160;</p>

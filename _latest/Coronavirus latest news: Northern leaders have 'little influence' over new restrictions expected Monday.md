Mayors and council leaders in the North have expressed their anger this morning at the prospect of the sweeping new rolling restrictions, set to be unveiled by Boris Johnson in the Commons on Monday, which they claim they’ve had “little influence over”.

There is a “large gulf” in the discussions between local leaders and the Government about possible new lockdown restrictions, the leader of Manchester City Council has said.

"We seem to have an almost impossible task of penetrating the Westminster bubble,” Sir Richard Leese said.

Joe Anderson, Mayor of Liverpool, speaking with Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham on Times Radio, said: "We've got very little powers or influence over this and we are being done to rather than being collaborated with or talked to.”

Mr Burnham called for more financial support and consultation, stating: "If they continue with this, jobs will be lost, businesses will collapse, the fragile economies of the North will be shattered."

Meanwhile, a group of Manchester MPs have written to Boris Johnson stating they "will not support" the city being put into a tier three lockdown - which would include the toughest restrictions.

"The data on where infections are occurring would not seem to support a rationale for your proposed measures," the letter states.

Robert Jenrick, Communities Secretary, told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: "You say that there's anger in the North, but the measures that we are bringing in here are universal.

"These apply across the whole of the United Kingdom and there is nothing that we would ever do that penalises one part of the country over another."

It comes as Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, warned the nation is now “at a tipping point similar to where we were in March” in our fight against Covid-19.

Prof Van-Tam said in a statement: “Although the epidemic re-started in younger adult age groups in the last few weeks, there is clear evidence of gradual spread into older age groups in the worst affected areas.

“Sadly, just as night follows day, increases in deaths will now follow on in the next few weeks.”

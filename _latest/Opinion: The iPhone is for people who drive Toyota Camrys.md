Since 2007, Apple has made the best, most popular smartphone on the planet. The company is expected to launch the new-and-improved iPhone 12 this week, and you can be assured it'll come with the Apple-approved "it just works" experience Steve Jobs fought for.

Toyota TM In many ways, the iPhone is like aCamry, a machine that offers familiarity and reliability over fun, productivity, speed, performance, innovation and futuristic features.

That's not a bad thing. The Camry is a good car, and Toyota sells boatloads of them every year to people who just want to get from point A to point B, without having to worry about what this button does or what driving mode they should switch to or whether their car is going to melt down while they're stuck in rush hour traffic.

The iPhone 12 will be no different. It will probably have some snazzier features -- perhaps better cameras, 5G connectivity and a high-refresh-rate screen . Even with a light redesign, some different colors and a snappier processor, it's still going to have that familiar iPhone look and feel, complete with the same iOS software experience we've grown accustomed to for 13 years.

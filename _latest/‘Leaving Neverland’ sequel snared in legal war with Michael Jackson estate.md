<div><p>The controversy is just beginning for the men behind &#8220;Leaving Neverland.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://-director-dan-reed-shooting-follow-up-film-1234599714/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deadline has reported</a> that director Dan Reed is currently filming in a Los Angeles Superior Court as Wade Robson and James Safechuck, the two men who alleged assault at Michael Jackson&#8217;s Neverland Ranch some 30 years ago, remain embroiled in lawsuits with the King of Pop&#8217;s legacy companies, including MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, who <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/09/16/michael-jackson-estate-slams-leaving-neverland-emmys-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deny the accusations</a> on the late entertainer&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>Reed&#8217;s plans to shoot a sequel to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/25/explosive-michael-jackson-documentary-details-shocking-sex-abuse-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explosive Emmy-winning HBO documentary</a> have been challenged as a result of the MJJ brands seeking to entangle the director in court proceedings after serving subpoenas to the documentarian and his production company, Amos Pictures, on September 21.</p>
<p>Jackson&#8217;s attorneys are also seeking a ban on filming in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Reed&#8217;s counter motion to remove the subpoenas came last week, making clear that the LA court had little jurisdiction over the UK-based production company, while also pointing out that Robson and Safechuck have not received payment from Amos Pictures, despite the Jackson companies claims to the contrary.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;The follow-up documentary for which I am currently filming in these cases is about current events taking place partly in public view and will be an unfolding narrative with multiple points of view,&#8221; wrote Reed in his 79-page motion, adding that he had asked MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures counsel Howard Weitzman to appear in the second documentary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have resolved that neither myself or anyone in my offices will participate in the documentary we all discussed for several reasons. Among them is the fact that you are already clearly on the record saying that you believe both accusers&#8217; stories without hesitation,&#8221; Weitzman responded in an email attached to Reed&#8217;s motion.</p>
<p>Louisa Compton, head of news and current affairs at Channel 4, contributed a statement in support of the sequel, which is due to debut on her UK-based network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understandably, the MJJ companies are not happy with &#8216;Leaving Neverland&#8217; or the making of the follow-up documentary,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is easy to see why they do not want the subject matter of these films to be reported to the public. However, as much as they may dislike the messages that are being conveyed by these documentaries, we strenuously oppose their efforts to &#8216;shoot the messenger.&#8217;&#8201;&#8221;</p>
<p>She continued on to say that the MJJ companies&#8217; claims to the journalist&#8217;s unpublished materials are meritless &#8220;given the strong legal protections that exist to protect freedom of expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The motives of the MJJ companies are further revealed by their attempt to ban Reed from filming in the courtroom and thereby prohibit him from getting footage to report on the proceedings,&#8221; she said, suggesting that Jackson&#8217;s legacy should have nothing to hide if their claims are true.</p>
<p>A hearing regarding Reed&#8217;s subpoena is scheduled for April 9, 2021.</p>
<p>Safechuck is now gearing up for an appeal of his case against MJJ companies over his alleged assault, which was dismissed on Tuesday by LA County Superior Court Judge Mark A. Young. Robson&#8217;s case is scheduled to go on trial June 14, 2021.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, HBO is <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/05/03/hbo-counters-michael-jackson-estates-100m-leaving-neverland-suit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fighting its own dispute with the Jackson estate</a> after they alleged the network had breached a non-disparagement clause found in a 1992 contract for HBO&#8217;s concert special on Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Dangerous&#8221; tour.</p>

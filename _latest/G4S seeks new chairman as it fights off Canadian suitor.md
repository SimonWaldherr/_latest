And with his tenure drawing to a close, either selling G4S or securing it as an independent company could be his final act.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">G4S chief executive Ashley Almanza said: 'We do have a succession plan. We've started well in time, and we are confident there will be a good successor.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Connolly, 70, took over as chairman of G4S in 2012 having risen to the top of Big Four auditor Deloitte, as Britain's best-paid accountant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has overseen a string of scandals, from its failure to supply enough security guards to the London Olympics to charging taxpayers for tagging offenders who were dead or back in prison.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he has held on to his &#163;382,000 a year job, adding to the fortune he made while at Deloitte, where one of his underlings was disgraced banker Fred Goodwin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shortly after Goodwin became chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland in 2001, the lender awarded the multi-million audit contract to Deloitte.</p><p class="money item html_snippet module">  </p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">While Deloitte raked in more than &#163;200million from the plum job, it failed to raise the alarm on the mountain of toxic debt on the balance sheet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier in his career, Connolly suffered a serious blow. The collapse of investment broker Barlow Clowes in 1988 after massive fraud was one of the biggest City's biggest scandals.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its downfall saddled taxpayers with a &#163;150million bill as they paid compensation to investors who lost their savings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Following an investigation, Connolly was judged to have signed off Barlow Clowes accounts with a lack of professional 'efficiency, conduct and competence'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Deloitte took issue with the criticism of Connolly who was subsequently appointed chief executive and global chairman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Connolly and Almanza are now leading the battle against Garda World, which is backed by private equity firm BC Capital. They say the bid 'significantly undervalues' G4S &#8211; and dismissed its suitor's criticisms as 'opportunistic' and 'scare-mongering'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Garda World boss Stephan Cretier said he would 'educate' shareholders on the true state of G4S. Connolly retorted wryly that a suitor should not be too negative about a firm he is trying to buy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around a quarter of shareholders have already rejected Garda World's offer.</p></div>

<div><p>Compton Mayor Aja Brown shared a story about an encounter last year with Los Angeles County sheriff&#8217;s deputies &#8212; one that she said was not unique among residents of her city.</p><p>After she was pulled over for allegedly failing to &#8220;stop at the limit line&#8221; at a red light, she said, deputies swarmed her car within seconds and searched Brown and her husband for drugs as their infant daughter sat in the back seat.</p><p>The mayor is among many there who have spoken out in recent months to demand changes in the way Compton is policed. The debate comes at a pivotal moment for both the city, which is rebounding after decades of violence and economic decline, and the Sheriff&#8217;s Department, which is under growing scrutiny over how it patrols predominately nonwhite communities  such as Compton.</p><p>&#8220;Everyone deserves justice, especially when it comes to &#8230; law enforcement that taxpayer dollars are paying for,&#8221;  Brown said. &#8220;We deserve some accountability.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>More than two decades ago, the department took over enforcement duties from a city police agency <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jul-25-me-compton25-story.html" target="_blank">that had struggled</a> to deal with a surge in killings. Initially, the sheriff won praise <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2011-jan-18-la-me-compton-crime-20110118-story.html" target="_blank">in some parts of Compton</a> as homicides declined. It was a major achievement in a city that in the 1980s and 1990s had become synonymous with gang violence. </p><p>But in recent years, many residents have complained of feeling under siege by the people who are supposed to protect them. </p><p>The department&#8217;s Compton station has been the site of ongoing and sometimes violent protests  after several deputy-involved killings &#8212; and become a focus of allegations of deputy gangs accused of serious misconduct. In the backdrop is a nationwide movement to force a reckoning over racial justice issues and hold law enforcement more accountable.</p>

<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>Although Brown and other officials have backed away from suggestions that the city may cut ties with the Sheriff&#8217;s Department, they recently underscored their concerns, requesting that the U.S. attorney and state attorney general&#8217;s offices investigate allegations of a &#8220;pattern and practice of pervasive federal civil rights violations.&#8221; </p><p>&#8220;We believe several deputies within Compton Station have a history of violence against Black and Latino men and women &#8230; [and] urge your office to open an investigation immediately into all potential civil rights abuses,&#8221; Compton City  Atty. Damon Brown wrote.</p><p>The Sheriff&#8217;s Department did not return calls seeking comment.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Compton currently pays Los Angeles County about $22 million annually to have deputies patrol the city of nearly 100,000. </p><p>Since the sheriff took over enforcement duties in 2000, the city has seen a remarkable turnaround, with crime significantly down from the 1990s. <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0815-compton-image-20150815-story.html" target="_blank">At its peak in 1991, Compton recorded 87 killings.</a> Last year the number had fallen to 21, according to the Sheriff&#8217;s Department&#8217;s website.</p><p>Violent crime &#8212; including homicide, robbery and aggravated assault &#8212; decreased nearly 1.5% through August of this year compared  with the same period in 2019, the department&#8217;s data show. </p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Longtime Compton resident Tito Palomares said his neighborhood has felt safer since the Sheriff&#8217;s Department came in. </p><p>&#8220;Before, you couldn&#8217;t even walk your dog outside,&#8221; the 36-year-old said as he packed groceries into his car near Rosecrans and North Central avenues. </p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen shootings,&#8221; Palomares said, but none since the deputies began patrolling the area. &#8220;I agree that there&#8217;s some bad cops, but I think they are mostly good.&#8221;</p><p>Compton officials acknowledge that violent crime has decreased over the years, but said the department&#8217;s responsibility in the community extends beyond just enforcement of the law. </p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Mayor Pro Tem Michelle Chambers said cutting ties with the Sheriff&#8217;s Department is not completely off the table, but city officials want to come  up with an &#8220;amicable resolution&#8221; on how to better serve residents.</p><p>&#8220;We need law enforcement,&#8221; Chambers said. &#8220;We just need respectful, fair law enforcement.&#8221;</p><p>The city was rocked in June, when 18-year-old Andres Guardado was fatally shot in neighboring Gardena, and in August, when bicyclist Dijon Kizzee, 29, was killed in Westmont. Recent allegations of a rogue, tattooed group of deputies known as the &#8220;Executioners&#8221; working within the Compton sheriff&#8217;s station and accused of using excessive force has also put the department under a microscope. </p><p>Sheriff Alex Villanueva vowed to crack down on deputy gangs but also has been accused by department watchdogs of failing to sufficiently discipline deputies. </p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Last month, two deputies were shot while sitting in their patrol car near the Compton Metro station. Deonte Lee Murray, 36, was arrested and charged with attempted murder.</p><p> Capt. La Tonya Clark, who grew up in Compton and took over as lead officer at the sheriff&#8217;s station in October 2019, would not comment on pending investigations of the Executioners or the police-involved shootings. Despite the criticism, she said, many residents support the department.</p><p>Still, the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the nationwide protests in support of criminal justice reform have set back community relations, Clark said.</p><p>&#8220;Right now there is a gap between law enforcement and the community,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We were on our way to being very successful in ending that gap and then certain events pushed us away. So I&#8217;m hoping that we can get back to mending those things.&#8221; </p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

    </p>
<p>Compton officials are hoping to bridge that gap as well with a review board launched in September. </p><p>The 11-member panel is composed of community stakeholders charged with providing recommendations for policy reform for the local sheriff&#8217;s station and will act as a liaison between residents and law enforcement. Board members, who were selected by City Council members, will also  monitor and field complaints from residents about the Sheriff&#8217;s Department.</p><p>&#8220;Our goal is to just change the chain of command for reporting and create more transparency so, at the very least, we are knowledgeable about what&#8217;s happening in the community,&#8221; the mayor said.</p><p>Clark said she welcomes oversight from residents. </p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

    </p>
<p> &#8220;What they will find is that every single complaint that is made to us, the Sheriff&#8217;s Department, is investigated accordingly,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not everyone is always happy with the outcome, but every complaint is taken seriously and we investigate thoroughly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pastor Michael Fisher of Greater Zion Church Family, who was nominated to the board, said he wants the committee to have &#8220;subpoena and investigative power&#8221; over the department.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not good enough just for the Sheriff&#8217;s [Department] to report to us after they&#8217;ve done what they&#8217;ve done,&#8221; said Fisher, 41, who has worked on several initiatives with the department over the years. &#8220;We want to be brought to the table.&#8221; </p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Justin Blakely said his father was an officer at the Compton Police Department for 15 years. </p><p>When he was younger, Blakely said, he had a positive view of police, which he attributed to the fact they lived and worked in the community they protected and served.

<p>A ballot initiative that would provide residents greater control over who polices the city is needed to force real reform, said William Kemp, a Compton native, longtime community activist and former mayoral candidate. </p><p>&#8220;I think if there was a line of communication and we could develop an olive branch with law enforcement, they&#8217;re the best law enforcement we could have,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when you get down to it, there has to be a better relationship with the community they serve in.&#8221;</p></div>

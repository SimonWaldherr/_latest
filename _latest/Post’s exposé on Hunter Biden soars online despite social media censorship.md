<div><p>Twitter and Facebook&#8217;s censorship of <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">The Post&#8217;s expos&#233;</a> about Hunter Biden&#8217;s business dealings in Ukraine propelled the story to the top of those platforms last week, according to a report Tuesday.</p>
<p>The story generated 2.59 million interactions &#8212; likes, comments and shares &#8212; on <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/facebook-twitter-block-the-post-from-posting/">Facebook and Twitter</a> &#8212; more than double the next biggest story about President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden, <a href="https://www.axios.com/new-york-post-hunter-biden-facebook-twitter-censor-bf8d9f32-f8cb-444e-bc12-c3b5e8694e84.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Axios reported</a>, citing data analyzed by NewsWhip.</p>
<p>Stories about Hunter Biden, the reactions and how social media responded were five of the 10 biggest stories.</p>
<p>It was the 6th-most engaged article for the month &#8212; behind Trump testing positive for the coronavirus and rocker Eddie Van Halen&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>Facebook accounted for 83 percent of the interactions, with the remaining 17 percent on Twitter, which also <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/twitter-still-holding-the-posts-account-hostage-over-hunter-biden-links/">suspended The Post&#8217;s account</a>.</p>
<p>The reaction of the social media platforms to the story was the second biggest topic last week, largely <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/twitter-censoring-posts-biden-expose-is-election-interference-gop/">driven by criticism</a> &amp; that the Silicon Valley giants were meddling in the election by practicing censorship.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee was expected to look into issuing subpoenas to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about their companies&#8217; actions, but has now delayed the vote.</p>
<p>The Post last Wednesday revealed an email to Hunter Biden from an adviser to the board of Burisma thanking him for the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to meet his father.</p>
<p>At the time, Hunter Biden served on the board and his father was vice president.</p>
<p>The elder Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, had previously said he never discussed his son&#8217;s overseas dealings.</p>
<p>Other emails described Hunter Biden&#8217;s effort to use his father&#8217;s influence to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/">develop business relationships in China</a>.</p>
<p>The messages came from a laptop Hunter Biden dropped off at a computer repair shop in Wilmington, Del., in April 2019 but never returned to pick up.</p>

  Britain’s most popular estate cars – what you’ll love and what to avoid 
description: > 
  When it comes to large family cars, most people in the UK naturally turn to the size and perceived space of an SUV.But there are many reasons why an estate might actually make more sense.These cars often offer more space, are more practical, come with lower running costs and are generally better to drive.They tend to be cheaper, too - particularly on the used market.So we tested the five most popular models (based on sales figures for 2019*) plus three great alternatives to see how they stand up to the rigours of modern family life.

Self-isolating Durham University students have complained that they were left without a hot meal for six days and forced to go to bed hungry.

One student – who tested positive within days of arriving at the university – said her peers were not allowed to order in any supplies and had to rely on food boxes provided by the university.

She described how the food boxes consisted of "parcels filled with junk food" and ready meals, adding: "We are in a catered college, so normally you would be given hot meals every day that would be cooked for us."

The student told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "When you are ill, you really need healthy food to make you better, and that is the advice you are given for people with coronavirus.

"The first box we were given had things like pot noodles, three ready meals, crisps, chocolate bars. We were given three apples. The next box had no fruit at all and it was meant to last us 11 days. The same things were in that box – ready meals, pot noodles. We have a microwave, a kettle and a toaster, and that is it.”

Over 250 students at Durham University, along with some five staff members, have tested positive since the start of term.

Students at two of its 17 colleges have been asked to remain on campus and only attend activities managed by the university for the next seven days in an attempt to contain coronavirus outbreaks.

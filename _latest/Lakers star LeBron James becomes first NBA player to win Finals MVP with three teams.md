LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. – Finals MVP with the Miami Heat, Finals MVP with the Cleveland Cavaliers and now Finals MVP with the Los Angeles Lakers.

LeBron James won his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP after the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat 106-93 in Game 6 of the Finals on Sunday night.

James scored 28 points on 13-for-20 shooting, collected 14 rebounds and compiled 10 assists – his Finals-record 11th triple-double.

For the series, he averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists and shot 59.1% from the field, including 41.7% on 3-pointers.

Only Michael Jordan with six has more Finals MVPs than James, who also won the award in 2012, 2013 and 2016. James becomes the first player in history to claim Finals MVPs with three teams.

"What I've learned being a Laker is that the Laker faithful don't give a damn what you've done before,” James said Thursday. “Until you become a Laker, you've got to do it with them, as well. They don't care about your resume at all until you become a Laker. Then you've got to do it as a Laker, and then they respect you. I've learned that.”

Through two games of the series, Anthony Davis and James were neck-and-neck for the award. But Davis had a quiet night in Miami’s Game 3 victory, and Miami’s Jimmy Butler inserted himself into the conversation with triple-doubles, including a Game 3 40-point, 13-assist, 11-rebound performance, in two victories.

As the series wore on, James, 35, began to leave his imprint on the series. He had at least 25 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in every game.

James had 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists in the first half of the series clincher as Los Angeles built a 64-36 lead.

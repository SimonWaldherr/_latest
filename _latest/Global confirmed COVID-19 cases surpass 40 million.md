<p>Johns Hopkins University, which collates COVID-19 reports from around the world, has recorded 40,076,184 confirmed cases of the virus.</p>
<p>The actual worldwide number, however, is believed to be much higher as testing has been variable, many have been asymptomatic and some governments have concealed the actual number of cases.</p>
<p>Globally, more than 1.1 million confirmed virus deaths have been reported &#8212; although experts also believe that number is an undercount.</p>
<p>The US, India and Brazil are reporting by far the highest numbers of coronavirus cases: with 8.1 million, 7.5 million and 5.2 million respectively.</p>
<p>But the recent global increase is driven by <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/08/scotland-shuts-glasgow-edinburgh-bars-as-virus-cases-surge/">a surge in Europe</a> &#8212; which has seen more than 240,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths.</p>
 
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/10/as-virus-cases-rise-again-europe-experiences-covid-fatigue/">Europe last week</a> also reported a record weekly high of nearly 700,000 new cases, according to the World Health Organization &#8212; which said that the region was responsible for about a third of global cases.</p>
<p>Britain, France, Russia and Spain account for about half of all new COVID-19 cases in the region, and countries like Belgium and the Czech Republic are battling more intense outbreaks than they faced earlier this year.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has warned that intensive care units in several European cities could soon be overwhelmed if governments and citizens do not adhere to mitigation measures.</p>
<p>Italy and Switzerland have initiated new mask-wearing requirements, schools have been shuttered in Northern Ireland and the Czech Republic, and restaurants and bars have been closed in Belgium and France.</p>
<p>France has <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/paris-placed-on-strict-curfew-amid-second-wave-of-covid-19/">implemented a 9 p.m. curfew</a> and limited lockdowns are in place in parts of the UK.</p>
 
<p>A previous WHO estimate calculated that about 1 in 10 of the world&#8217;s population &#8212; around 780 million people in total &#8212; have contracted COVID-19. That&#8217;s nearly 20 times the official number of cases currently reported.</p>

 <p>     </p> <p>The data shows a 79% rise in deaths from dementia, a 75% rise in deaths from breast cancer and a 53% rise in deaths from prostate cancer at home.</p> <p>Caroline Abrahams, director at Age UK said: &#8220;Tragically, we know some older people not in contact with services may have just fallen off the radar completely during the pandemic and died alone.&#8221;</p> <p>There were 116,000 deaths in private homes registered in England and Wales between the start of 2020 up to September 11.</p> <p>"This was a rise of 27,000 or an increase of 23% compared to the five-year average.</p> <p>Some will have been &#8220;exported&#8221; from hospitals, but experts fear people may be enduring agonising final hours alone without pain relief.</p>

   <p>Usually around 300 people die each day in their homes in England and Wales. Even after the peak of the pandemic, this has stayed at around 400 and shows no sign of declining.</p> <p>Statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, of Cambridge University, said: &#8220;Most people want to die at home. What I would love to know is what proportion have been positive experiences and what have been really awful.&#8221;</p> <p>Most deaths involved people aged 70 to 89 and the leading cause has been coronary heart disease.</p> <p>For men heart disease deaths at home in England were 26% up and bowel cancer deaths, 46% up.</p> <p>For women, deaths in private homes from dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s increased by 75%.</p> <p>Simon Jones, director at Marie Curie, demanded &#8220;a comprehensive investigation&#8221; into home deaths.</p> <p> Fiona Carragher, director at the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society said: &#8220;The impact of isolation, fear of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> and suspension of health and social care services will have contributed to the catastrophic increase in people with dementia dying.&#8221; </p>

 <p>Carer Kathleen Cooke has told how her 88-year-old husband has declined during lockdown and she fears for their future.</p> <p>The retired civil servant said Barry has lost the ability to walk due to being stuck in the home so much.</p> <p>Kathleen, 72, has asthma and Barry has dementia so both have been encouraged to shield.</p> <p>&#8220;There are only so many steps you can make in the house. It was like we were in prison. He is a lot more frail and has fallen twice in the last week. He had fluid on his legs and developed an ulcer,&#8221; Kathleen says.</p> <p>&#8220;People will be dying because of accidents. Others will have got so depressed they&#8217;ve lost the will to live. Social services is on its knees. There are old people on their own who need help.&#8221;</p> <p>The couple, of Blackpool, Lancs, have no children and she says &#8221;my nightmare is something will happen to me so I won&#8217;t be able to care for him. I&#8217;ll carry on until I can&#8217;t any more&#8221;.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>Kelly Smith was distraught when her chemotherapy was stopped against her wishes, fearing she was being robbed of precious time with her son Finn, six.</p> <p>Six weeks after treatment for stage four bowel cancer was halted due to the pandemic, the cancer attacked her liver.</p> <p>Kelly, 31, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, was told she had two to four weeks to live and, tragically, she died in June.</p> <p>Her father Craig Russell said: &#8220;Whilst there was a risk of catching Covid it was a potential risk, compared to the chemotherapy, which, without it, she would definitely die.</p> <p>To me, that wasn&#8217;t a fair trade. To have no choice and to go down the route that Kelly went just makes it feel like it was completely avoidable. She was robbed of maybe another six months, 12 months, 18 months of life that she would have got to spend with her son.</p> <p>&#8220;Once they stopped the chemo there was nothing to hold the cancer back.&#8221;</p> <p>He and Kelly&#8217;s mum Mandy have launched Catch Up With Cancer, a campaign urging Matt Hancock to boost cancer services and stop patients dying unnecessarily.</p> <p> Their&#160; <a href="http://change.org/" rel="nofollow">change.org</a> &#160;petition last night had 316,864 signatures. </p></div>

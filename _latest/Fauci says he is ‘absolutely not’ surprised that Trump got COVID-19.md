<div><p>White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said he is &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; surprised that President Trump contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>Fauci, in an interview that aired Sunday night on CBS&#8217; &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; said he came to that assessment after seeing the lack of safety measures against the bug at the Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony announcing Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s Supreme Court nomination.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw that on TV, I said, &#8216;Oh my goodness,&#8217;&#8221; Fauci recalled in the interview.</p>
<p>The infectious disease expert called the event &#8220;a completely precarious situation&#8221; with no social distancing and limited mask-wearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing good can come out of that,&#8221; Fauci said. &#8220;That&#8217;s got to be a problem &#8212; and then sure enough it turned out to be a super spreader event.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear where the White House outbreak began.</p>
<p>But a significant number of the Rose Garden ceremony&#8217;s attendees &#8212; including Trump, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie &#8212; later tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>

Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he is sure the UK government will want to honour the principle that any support for business in England hit by lockdown measures will be made available to the other parts of the UK.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak will set out later on Friday more support for businesses forced to close by law, with tighter virus rules expected in England next week.

The Treasury says he will outline the next stage of the Job Support Scheme to help firms that "may have to close in the coming weeks or months".

Mr Drakeford told his regular Friday press conference: "We were in correspondence with the Treasury yesterday to make sure that if there is money that will go to support businesses in England that that money must be available to support all parts of the United Kingdom - Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales - as well, where we have to take action to bear down on the virus."

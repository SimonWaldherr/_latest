Kirstie Alley announced she’s throwing her weight behind President Trump in the election “because he’s not a politician” — then was attacked by other celebrities online.

The “Cheers” actress said Saturday that she would be casting her vote for Trump after first supporting him in 2016.

“I’m voting for @realDonaldTrump because he’s NOT a politician,” she wrote on Twitter. “I voted for him 4 years ago for this reason and shall vote for him again for this reason.”

“He gets things done quickly and he will turn the economy around quickly,” she added.

But in the hours after her tweet, the actress was targeted by other celebrities for backing the president again.

“Shelly Long was way funnier than you,” director Judd Apatow wrote, referring to both actresses playing actor Ted Danson’s love interests on “Cheers.”

Fellow actress Patricia Arquette responded: “Well my vote for Biden canceled yours out. I have done my civic duty of the day.”

Meanwhile, comedian Natasha Rothwell suggested Alley was a has-been, despite the endorsement trending on Twitter.

“Kirstie Alley’s tweet screamed ‘I can’t read! I don’t watch the news! Black Lives Don’t Matter! My body, your choice! and Pussies wear masks! And sexuality is a preference!'” Rothwell wrote on Twitter.

“But all I can think about is how 87% of the people on here will have to google who she is.”

Alley responded by saying that she’s never seen “so much name-calling in my life.”

“I guess I’m not allowed to have a viewpoint without being called a really nasty names by what I’m going to suppose are really nasty people,” she tweeted.

  Tesla will gain another 14% as company closes in on 500,000 annual deliveries, Wedbush says 
description: > 
  Odd Andersen/AFP via Getty ImagesStrong third-quarter deliveries set Tesla up for a healthy earnings beat on Wednesday and a sales milestone before the year is out, Wedbush analysts said Friday.The success abroad brings Tesla closer to hitting 500,000 deliveries in 2020, an achievement that was merely a "pipe dream" for the automaker and its peers just six months ago, Wedbush added.With electric-vehicle demand rebounding from a mid-2020 slump, Tesla is on track to beat earnings expectations and reach a delivery milestone, Wedbush analysts said Sunday.The automaker's third-quarter deliveries already came in above expectations, as sales of its Model 3 sedan driving the strong read.China in particular can "markedly increase" Tesla's profitability over the next few years as the country comes to represent more than 40% of the automaker's annual sales, Wedbush added.

In 2017, Kershaw <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=kershcl01&amp;t=p&amp;year=0&amp;post=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allowed one earned run</a> over seven innings in a 3-1 win over Houston. Two years ago, he conceded five earned runs in an 8-4 defeat to the Boston Red Sox.&#160;</p><p class="">The 32-year-old opened the postseason with an incredible 13-strikeout performance in the wild-card round against Milwaukee. Since then, he allowed seven earned runs in 11 frames against Atlanta and San Diego.&#160;</p><p class="">If the Dodgers get a performance from Kershaw similar to his 2017 World Series opener, he could hand them an early advantage that takes less pressure off their pitching situation.</p><p id="br-ad-103844575" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Walker Buehler is the obvious No. 2 to Kershaw in the rotation, but if the Dodgers bring him back for Game 2, he would be pitching on three days rest. If Los Angeles wants him on full rest, he would not start until Friday in a potential showdown with Charlie Morton.</p><p class="">Buehler could be Los Angeles' difference-maker on the mound. He threw <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=buehlwa01&amp;t=p&amp;year=0&amp;post=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seven shutout innings</a> in his lone World Series start in 2018 and allowed four earned runs in four starts this postseason.&#160;</p><p class="">If the Dodgers align Buehler to start opposite Morton, they could neutralize Tampa Bay's most experienced arm. Morton <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=mortoch02&amp;t=p&amp;year=0&amp;post=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conceded two earned runs</a> in 10.1 innings to help Houston beat the Dodgers in 2017.&#160;</p><p class="">Of course, two pitching performances will not determine the final result of the World Series, but they could play a crucial role in setting up the final few games.&#160;</p><p class="">With Kershaw and Buehler in play for two of the first three contests, the Dodgers appear to be in the best position possible to end their title drought that dates back to 1988.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class="">Follow Joe on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/JTansey90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JTansey90.</a></p><p class="">Statistics obtained from <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baseball Reference</a>.</p></div>

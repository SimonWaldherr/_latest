  Supermarket price war wipes out higher grocery costs from lockdown 
description: > 
  Grocery bills have fallen after an initial rise at the peak of the Covid-19 crisis as a supermarket price war takes hold.Prices have dropped through the summer after a 2.5pc rise in inflation in the first month of the nationwide lockdown.By the first week of August, the price of groceries was around 0.5pc higher than it was at the beginning of the year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.An increase in promotions, such as 20pc off certain items or similar, has led to prices gradually returning to normal levels.

<div><p>Lily James is avoiding the press.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old actress has canceled her appearance on BBC&#8217;s &#8220;The Graham Norton Show&#8221; to promote her new film with Armie Hammer, &#8220;Rebecca,&#8221; amid relationship drama with Dominic West, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/10/19/lily-james-cancels-graham-norton-appearance-us-chat-show-today-dominic-west-drama-13443326/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Metro UK reported</a>. She was supposed to appear alongside Bruce Springsteen, Matthew McConaughey and musical guest Sam Smith.</p>
<p>The BBC didn&#8217;t immediately return Page Six&#8217;s request for comment.</p>
<p>James also <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/18/lily-james-cancels-today-show-appearance-amid-dominic-west-drama/">axed an appearance on the &#8220;Today&#8221; show</a>&#160;where she was expected to promote the Netflix film.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&#8221; star&#8217;s decision to cease promoting her latest film comes after she was spotted <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/12/lily-james-cozies-up-to-married-co-star-dominic-west-in-rome/">cozying up</a> to the former &#8220;Wire&#8221; actor, 51, who is married to Catherine FitzGerald. After <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/13/inside-dominic-west-and-lily-james-romantic-roman-romp/">photos of James and West</a> vacationing together in Rome were published, West returned to his wife and <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/13/dominic-west-and-wife-catherine-kiss-after-lily-james-photos/">declared their marriage was &#8220;strong.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>James and West are co-starring in the mini-series &#8220;The Pursuit of Love,&#8221; but it&#8217;s unclear when they started pursuing each other. Over the summer, James was <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/07/09/chris-evans-and-lily-james-photographed-on-an-ice-cream-date/">linked to Chris Evans</a> after splitting from longtime boyfriend Matt Smith.</p>

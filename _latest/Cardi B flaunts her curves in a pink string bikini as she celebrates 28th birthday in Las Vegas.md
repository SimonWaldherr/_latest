Cardi B jetted off to Las Vegas for the weekend to celebrate her 28th birthday in a star-studded affair attended by Kylie Jenner and Megan Thee Stallion.

And the WAP rapper shared some hilarious footage of herself strutting down the entryway of her lavish penthouse suite with her Instagram followers on Sunday.

'My walk on dumb cause I’m still drunk,' confessed Cardi, who hosted an epic birthday bash the night prior.

In the brief clip, Cardi B, born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, flaunted her famous curves in a pink string bikini as she teetered down the lengthy entryway.

She removed a pair of sunglasses from her face and carried a coordinating Birkin bag in the crook of her arm.

The hitmaker's raven hair was styled in an array of voluminous waves and she sported a full face of glamorous makeup.

Once she reached the end of the entryway, she did a wobbly spin for the camera that showed off her massive peacock tattoo and pert derriere.

Cardi B then struck a pose and stared into the camera lens seductively before the video abruptly cut off.

Prior to her shameless birthday strut, the Money rapper gave her 76.5million followers a peek at the various birthday decorations set-up inside her penthouse suite.

There were tons and tons of gold balloons resting atop the ceiling and the fireplace was decked out in gold tinsel and multi-toned balloon formations.

The most eye-catching formation happened to spell out Cardi B's name in metallic gold letter balloons.

She then panned her camera over what appeared to be a birthday cake made to look like a pile of gold bricks.

There also framed photos of Cardi that lined the massive display that the cake was featured on.

Cardi then briefly pointed her camera in the direction of one of her closest gal pals who happened to be twerking by herself in the next room.

Cardi's birthday was attended by a host of A-list stars including Kylie Jenner and Megan Thee Stallion.

Kylie shared her appreciation for her friend Cardi B by gifting her with a much-coveted Birkin bag for her 28th birthday, as seen on the WAP hitmaker's Instagram Story on Sunday.

Birkin bags, from French high fashion designer Hermes, are considered the epitome of luxury in a handbag, with retail prices ranging anywhere from a paltry $9.85K all the way up to $500K at auction.

Cardi's present was a lovely shade of teal blue, akin to the blue of a Tiffany's gift box.

Kylie documented her wow-effect outfit worn to the shindig on her Instagram – a super-sexy mesh peach minidress which let her busty figure be on full display.

The soiree was also attended by Cardi's other WAP collaborator, Megan Thee Stallion, who wowed herself in a sheer all-black bodysuit number.

Jenner, however, did not spend all night at Cardi's fete – she was partying with her friends and the group continued their own festivities aboard her private jet.

Sunday's string of videos came less than a day after Cardi and estranged husband Offset sparked rumors they had rekindled their love.

The estranged pair were spotted sharing a kiss at Cardi's wild 28th birthday party on Saturday night.

They didn't look like they were at odds, despite the fact Cardi officially filed for divorce September 16th.

In addition to publicly locking lips, Cardi B grinded on Offset outside a night club, after partying with pals Megan Thee Stallion and DJ SpinKing.

The Grammy nominee, who is the father of the Bronx-born performer's two-year-old daughter Kulture, appeared in high spirits during the very friendly exchange.

Meanwhile, the I Like It crooner was blown away after he surprised her with a Rolls Royce truck, days after he already gifted her a bright pink billboard from their tot.

The costly vehicle was even customized for the star, as her little girl's name could be seen embroidered on a lush car seat.

Earlier in the night, she could be seen getting even cozier with her on-again, off-again flame, in a skintight white gown, which showed off her famous derriere.

While the birthday girl got flirty with her man, she could be seen sporting a beaming smile.

At the same time, Offset looked mesmerized by her eye-popping curves and raunchy dance moves.

As she sipped a number of cocktails, footage from the night showed her looking absolutely flawless with her glamorous makeup and voluminous tresses styled in a half-up, half down hairdo.

She completed her alluring ensemble with a number of diamond bracelets and drop earrings, which matched her long, jewel-encrusted nails.

At one point, the songwriter posed with her tongue out and hands in the air, as she turned heads with her tiny waist.

After enjoying a massive, four-tier cake at the club and twerking the night away, the mother-of-one continued her festivities at a private home with her closest friends.

And, at one point, she ended up sensually dancing on top of Offset with her legs straddled around him, after changing into a pair of light grey sweats.

Dancing: The Bodak Yellow singer let loose, as she publicly reunited with her ex for the first time, since announcing she filed for divorce from on September 16

The Bodak Yellow singer has not commented on her current relationship status with Offset, since she filed for divorce on September 16.

While Saturday night marked the duo's first sighting together since announcing their split, she has continued to defend him from social media attacks.

Earlier this week, in a since-deleted tweet, she said the father-of-four was a 'dumba** not a bad man.'

According to Complex the since-deleted tweets continued: '...cause out of everybody that tried to steal, finesse me into working with their brand for less he got people coming for me with CORRECT CONTRACTS and never ask for a dollar or benefit like every1 else. N***** is n**** but a bad personality he not.'

Cardi (born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar) also threatened to 'slap the s*** out of' one Twitter user 'out of courtesy' of their toddler.

Wow! While not all her friends could be physically present for her birthday amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Kylie Jenner sent a memorable gift

'I don't give a f*** if you don't like him,' the Me Gusta rapper wrote in a second deleted tweet - according to People.

'I don't talk to him but you not going to disrespect my child father...If he die, go broke, you not the one that's going to raise my kid & you not the 1 who pays for her s***.'

Cardi amicably filed for divorce from the 28-year-old Migos rapper last month- days before what would've been their third wedding anniversary, because she was 'tired of f*****g arguing' but not over infidelity.

Offset (born Kiari Kendrell Cephus) is also father to three older children - daughter Kalea, 5; son Jordan, 10; and son Kody, 5 - with babymamas Shya L'amour, Justine Watson, and Oriel Jamie.

The Need It hip-hop star will next perform on October 16 in downtown Atlanta to 'help raise money for artists and creatives who have or are experiencing economic hardship due to the COVID-19.'

Cardi- whose 'DMs are flooded' with potential suitors - had an exciting week, as she received towering desserts and gifts ahead of her birthday.

Special guest: On Sunday, the party continued for Cardi, who was joined by Kylie Jenner, who wore an eye-catching sparkly mini dress, and her BFF Stassie in Las Vegas

Kylie Jenner and her BFF Stassie were also apparently at Cardi's bash, despite not posing with Cardi, as they heavily documented their time in Las Vegas on social media.

In her posts, Jenner looked reading to cut loose in an eye-catching sparkly mini dress, before continuing the fun on her private jet as they headed home.

She and pals Stassie, and former assistant Victoria, sipped on Don Julio 1942 and Red Bull, as they partied it up Vegas style, in a high-roller suite.

<div><p>The Bellator 250 lineup has been finalized.</p>
<p>The promotion formalized the 11-fight card Tuesday with one main card addition, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/veta-arteaga">Veta Arteaga</a> vs. <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/desiree-yanez">Desiree Yanez</a> at flyweight, and one preliminary bout, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/ty-gwerder">Ty Gwerder</a> vs. <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/dalton-rosta">Dalton Rosta</a> at middleweight, a promotion official informed MMA Junkie.</p>
<p>The event will be composed of a three-fight main card and eight preliminary card bouts.</p>
<p>Bellator 250 takes place Thursday, Oct. 29 at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn. The main card airs on CBS Sports Network after prelims on MMA Junkie.</p>
<p>Arteaga (5-4 MMA, 4-4 BMMA) looks to rebound from back-to-back losses to Bellator women&#8217;s flyweight champion Ilima-Lei Macfarlane and Alejandra Lara. Meanwhile, Yanez (5-2 MMA, 0-0 BMMA) attempts to make a good first impression in her Bellator debut.</p>
<p>Gwerder (5-1 MMA, 1-1 BMMA) and Rosta (3-0 MMA, 3-0 BMMA) will compete for the second time since Bellator&#8217;s return from a pandemic-induced hiatus. At Bellator 243 in August, Rosta defeated Mark Gardner by TKO due to a cut at the end of Round 1. At Bellator 246 in September, Gwereder finished George Tokkos with strikes in Round 3.</p>
<p>With the addition, the finalized Bellator 250 lineup includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gegard Mousasi vs. Douglas Lima &#8211; for Bellator middleweight title</li>
<li>Henry Corrales vs. Brandon Girtz</li>
<li>Veta Arteaga vs. Desiree Yanez</li>

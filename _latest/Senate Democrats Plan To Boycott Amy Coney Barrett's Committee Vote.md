  Senate Democrats Plan To Boycott Amy Coney Barrett's Committee Vote 
description: > 
  Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee plan to boycott Thursday’s committee vote on Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination as a protest against Republican efforts to rush her through before the election.These would be the same pictures of people Democrats had on display during Barrett’s confirmation hearing last week.Democrats also intend to hold two press conferences to push back on Barrett’s confirmation ― one on the Capitol steps and one on the Supreme Court steps.They will go to one or both of these pressers during the committee vote, according to the Democratic aide.A boycott will delight progressives, who have been clamoring for a big fight by Democrats over Barrett’s confirmation.

However, with ministers facing ongoing resistance to tougher lockdown measures unless additional financial support is provided, Number 10 warned that it had the “ability to impose measures if it was felt that was what was needed to reduce transmission and to protect the NHS".

Tensions escalated further just hours later when Mr Burnham warned that the Manchester region would consider a legal challenge if ministers placed it into tier three by “imposition, not consent.”

Earlier in the day, a joint statement signed by leaders of the region’s local authorities also pushed back against the calls, arguing that its infection rates and hospital admissions remained “much lower” than Liverpool’s.

After a meeting with the deputy chief medical officer, Mr Burnham said: “We are expecting a further meeting with the PM’s team in the morning. Until then, I won’t be making any further comment.”

With people living in Covid-19 hotspots in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland barred from entering Wales from Friday, a Senedd source confirmed that police would enforce the travel ban and would be authorised to issue fines.

Mr Drakeford said his decision to implement a travel ban on people from hotspots came after Boris Johnson twice failed to respond to his letters, which he said was “not respectful”.

“I just think it makes such simple sense that it is a bit baffling as to why the Prime Minister seems to have dug his heels in,” he added.

His approach was quickly endorsed by Nicola Sturgeon, who said she would write to Mr Johnson to “seek urgent talks on the issue”.

She later tweeted that “these are public health decisions, and nothing to do with constitutional or political debates” and confirmed that the Scottish Government would “also take whatever action we consider necessary to control Covid”.

Ms Sturgeon also singled out Blackpool as an area to be avoided due to it being "associated with a large and growing number of Covid cases in Scotland".

She added while Blackpool was “a place that many Scots love and like to visit” and that many would have “happy childhood memories of going to see the Blackpool illuminations”, it should be avoided due to its “high risk” classification.

Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s First Minister announced a month-long circuit breaker after its department of health recorded a further 1,217 cases and four more deaths associated with Covid-19 on Wednesday.

Arlene Foster confirmed that from Friday the half-term holiday would be extended, that overnight stays in other homes would be banned, and that pubs and restaurants would only remain open if they offered a takeaway. Throughout the lockdown, places of worship, shops and gyms will remain open.

Mrs Foster said: “The Executive has taken this decision because it is necessary, and we discussed the impacts in great detail. We do not take this step lightly.”

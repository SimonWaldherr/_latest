Dak Prescott’s brother Tad delivered an emotional and hopeful message on social media after the Cowboys quarterback suffered a compound fracture of his right ankle Sunday.

“God is good, and he’ll be back STRONGER than ever,” Tad Prescott wrote on Twitter along with posting a picture of him with a smile Dak in his hospital room. “I [expletive] guarante3 IT. Let’s go @dak continue to walk by #FAITH & I’ll make sure you continue to #FIGHT.”

Dak Prescott, 27, severely rolled his ankle while being tackled by Giants safety Logan Ryan in the third quarter of Dallas’ eventual 37-34 victory over Big Blue at AT&T Stadium. He was carted off the field in pain and rushed to a Dallas hospital to have surgery.

Dak Prescott’s plight also resonated with former Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, who suffered arguably the most gruesome leg injury in NFL history when he was sacked by Lawrence Taylor on “Monday Night Football” in 1985 and broke his fibula and tibia — ending his career.

“Feel for bad for Dak,” Theismann tweeted.

The injury came on the same day Redskins quarterback Alex Smith played his first game since incurring a spiral and compound fracture to his right tibia and fibula in 2018.

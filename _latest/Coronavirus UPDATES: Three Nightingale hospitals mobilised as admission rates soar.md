Three temporary Nightingale hospitals in the north of England could be brought back into use to deal with the spike in coronavirus cases.

The facilities in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate have been asked to "mobilise" over the next few weeks to be ready to accept patients if needed.

It will be for local clinicians to decide whether they are used for Covid-19 patients or to provide extra capacity to maintain services for people without coronavirus.

Deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam also warned hospital deaths will rise in a briefing on the latest data at Downing Street this morning.

The announcement came after it was reported that the Army will be drafted to Liverpool to help the city in its coronavirus efforts.

At 3.30pm today Boris Johnson will address MPs in the House of Commons, before delivering an televised update to the people.

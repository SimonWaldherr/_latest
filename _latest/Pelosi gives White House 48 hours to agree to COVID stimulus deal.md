<div><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday gave the White House 48 hours to reach a deal on a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/06/trump-calls-top-republicans-to-talk-covid-19-stimulus-legislation/">new coronavirus stimulus plan</a> &#8212; saying otherwise Congress will not be able to pass the relief before the November election.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 48 only relates to if we want to get it done before the election &#8212; which we do,&#8221; Pelosi said on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dems-wh-48-hours-reach-stimulus-agreement-election/story?id=73672906&amp;cid=clicksource_4380645_4_heads_hero_live_hero_hed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ABC News&#8217; &#8220;This Week.&#8221;</a> &#8220;But we&#8217;re saying to them we have to freeze the design on some of these things, are we going with it or not, and what is the language.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pressed on the success of an agreement by anchor George Stephanopoulos, the California Democrat said it &#8220;depends on the administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have agreement in the language yet, but I&#8217;m hopeful,&#8221; Pelosi said. &#8220;I&#8217;m optimistic because, again, we&#8217;ve been back and forth on all of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been in talks for months in an effort <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/09/pelosi-mnuchin-restart-covid-19-stimulus-talks-as-election-looms/">to hammer out a stimulus deal</a>.</p>
<p>They spoke for more than an hour on Saturday and are expected to return to the negotiating table on Monday.</p>
<p>Stephanopoulos also noted that the speaker and President Trump haven&#8217;t spoken in a year, and asked Pelosi if she was willing to pick up a phone to talk to the White House.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a great deal of respect for the office I hold, speaker of the House, and I have a great deal of respect for the position that he holds, president of the United States. This is not a casual conversation. This is about a meeting of the head of the first branch of government, the legislative branch, and the president,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In May, the Democratic-controlled House approved a $3 trillion package that went nowhere in the Senate.</p>
<p>The White House offered a compromise $1.8 billion plan.</p>
<p>Pelosi said the deal&#8217;s price tag was just a part of what it needs to offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The testing. The tracing. The treatment. The mask-wearing. The separation. The sanitation. And all that goes with it,&#8221; she said, adding that she wants more information about a national strategy to combat the pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/senate-to-vote-on-skinny-covid-19-relief-bill-and-ppp-funds/">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell</a> said on Saturday he plans to have the Senate vote on a $300 billion &#8220;skinny&#8221; stimulus package on Wednesday.</p>
<p>That bill was already rejected by Democrats in September</p>

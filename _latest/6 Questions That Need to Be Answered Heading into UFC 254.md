It tends to get applied to mixed martial arts bouts a little too often, but in this case, it could not sum things up more succinctly.</p><p class="">If ever there was a seemingly unstoppable force in <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/mma">MMA</a>, it's the 2020 iteration of Gaethje: a veritable typhoon of violence, seemingly incapable of doing anything but destroy. And if an immovable object has ever existed in this sport, it's Nurmagomedov: a man who has not been beaten in 28 professional fights and looks increasingly untouchable each time he steps into the cage.&#160;</p><p class="">This is a fight that has fans drooling like dogs in a butcher shop&#8212;and one that has oddsmakers sweating. And it's just days away.&#160;</p><p class="">Of course, this amazing main event is not all UFC 254 has to offer.</p><p class="">The card will be co-headlined by a compelling middleweight fight between former champion Robert Whittaker and surging contender Jared Cannonier. Whittaker will be looking to move to 2-0 since surrendering the title to Israel Adesanya, while Cannonier is expected to earn his own crack at the belt with a win.</p><p class="">The card also features a number of other interesting fights that should result in a night that will answer a ton of questions about different divisions and fighters.</p><p class="">Without further ado, here are the questions we hope will be answered by the time UFC 254 wraps up.</p></ol>

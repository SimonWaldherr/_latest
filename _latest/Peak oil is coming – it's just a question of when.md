<div><p>Peak demand for oil is certainly approaching but opinion is divided about the timing of its arrival. BP foresees in one of its scenarios a dramatic decline in consumption on the horizon and has warned <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/09/16/bp-drops-cluster-bomb-big-oil/">&#8220;peak oil&#8221; is already upon us</a>.</p>
<p>Its most aggressive forecast expects global demand to halve to 55m barrels per day&#160;by 2050 if governments and consumers adopt uncompromising energy transition policies to address climate change.</p>
<p>But BP&#8217;s doomsday estimate for the future of the oil industry isn&#8217;t universally shared by everyone. Opec,&#160;the cartel of producers led by Saudi Arabia&#160;that controls a third of the world&#8217;s oil, is more sanguine on the subject.</p>
<p>In its recently released World Oil Outlook, the organisation said it expected demand to only level off by 2040, with crude consumption set to peak at just over 109m barrels per day before declining gradually thereafter.</p>
<p>Although Opec doesn&#8217;t deny the risks of climate change, it expects major consuming countries such as China and India, along with other developing regions, to continue burning and processing fossil fuels for decades after the internal combustion engine is legislated off Europe&#8217;s roads by a barrage of carbon-reducing policies and taxes.</p>

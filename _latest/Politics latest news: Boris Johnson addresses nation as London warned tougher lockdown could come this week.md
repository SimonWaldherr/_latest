Boris Johnson will tonight address the nation on new local lockdown measures - as the Mayor of London warned the capital could face tougher restrictions this week.

The Prime Minister earlier today announced a new system of local Covid Alert Levels, dividing England into "medium", "high" and "very high" alert levels under a new three-tier system of local restrictions.

The announcement came as Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, suggested the capital could see a "high" level imposed within days, which would prevent households mixing indoors.

Mr Khan said London's alert level, which is currently at "medium", could be escalated "very quickly - potentially even this week".

"The virus is now spreading very quickly in every corner of London," his spokesman warned.

The Liverpool City Region faces the toughest local lockdown restrictions in England, while Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Leicester are among those to have escaped the worst of the new lockdown measures by being placed on the Tier 2 under the new traffic lights system.

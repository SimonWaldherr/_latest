<div><p id="1z5a5T">IBF middleweight champion Gennadiy Golovkin will presumably make the first defense of his current reign against Polish mandatory challenger Kamil Szeremeta <a href="https://www.badlefthook.com/2020/9/23/21453002/gennadiy-golovkin-next-fight-kamil-szeremeta-now-planned-november-21-dazn-boxing-news">later this year</a>, and the sanctioning body already has a plan to determine the next contender. IBF #4 Patrick Wojcicki and #6 Patrice Volny are set to duke it out in a November 14th final eliminator in Wojicicki&#8217;s native Wolfsburg, Germany.</p>
<p id="eyQTxs">Wojcicki (14-0-1, 5 KO), a 2012 Olympian who lost to the very capable Alexis Vastine in the opening round, has spent virtually the entirety of his five-year pro career in his home country, leaving only to beat Darryl Sharp on the Chris Eubank Jr. vs. Arthur Abraham undercard. He doesn&#8217;t have what anyone could call a &#8220;signature victory,&#8221; though he&#8217;s beaten a few half-decent opponents and thrice gone 12 rounds.</p>
<p id="XZrcRW">Wojcicki, known by fans as &#8216;The Wolf&#8217;, said the fight is an opportunity he has earned, and one he intends to take full advantage of.</p>
<p id="MQ26jz">&#8220;I have worked for this fight. I have trained hard, taken tough fights and worked with my team around me to get into a position where I&#8217;m one step away from a world title shot. My coach, my promoters, myself, we have all really worked for this, I&#8217;m not going to let that work go to waste.&#8221;</p>
<p id="5PvmhT">He continued, &#8220;Patrice is a fighter who has worked into this position as well. He will be confident and will see the opportunity that lies ahead, but I don&#8217;t believe he has what is needed to get past me. I&#8217;m ready for this, and I&#8217;m ready for what is next!&#8221;</p>
<p id="GHQJux">Volny (15-0, 9 KO) is in a similar professional boat, just with Canada instead of Germany. He hasn&#8217;t been fighting complete bums, but Wojcicki represents as significant a step-up in competition as vice-versa.</p>
<p id="8Aul7L">Of the fight, Patrice Volny said &#8220;This is an amazing opportunity to box in a final eliminator for the IBF World Title, an opportunity like this is not one I could let pass. This is by far the biggest fight of my career, against a very talented opponent &#8211; so I&#8217;m training like I&#8217;ve never trained before. When he steps in the ring with me, he will soon understand why they call me &#8216;Vicious&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

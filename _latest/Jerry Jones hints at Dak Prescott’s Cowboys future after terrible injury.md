Dak Prescott is expected to be released from the hospital Monday after undergoing successful surgery to repair a compound fracture and dislocation in his right ankle suffered in Sunday’s win over the Giants, according to the NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero.

The Dallas Cowboys’ quarterback is expected to miss the rest of the season, and he remains unsigned beyond this year’s franchise tag of $31.4 million.

While the sides have been unable to come to terms on a long-term contract, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones hinted that he expects the pending free agent and two-time Pro Bowler to return to Dallas next season.

Even without an extension, Prescott would be eligible for a second franchise tag for the 2021 season worth $37.7 million, a $6.3 million raise.

“We are all heartbroken for Dak and this very disappointing injury,” Jones said in a statement. “The outpouring of messages that I have received regarding his setback speaks volumes to the respect and admiration that he has earned from his teammates, former Cowboys players, and Cowboys supporters everywhere.

“We have no doubt that he will return to the position of leadership and purpose that he brings to our team.”

The fifth-year quarterback out of Mississippi State was injured on a scramble and carted off the field with 6:46 left in the third quarter of Sunday’s 37-34 home win over the Giants. Veteran backup Andy Dalton led the game-tying and game-winning drives, with kicker Greg Zuerlein nailing two field goals in the final 1:56, including a 34-yarder as time expired.

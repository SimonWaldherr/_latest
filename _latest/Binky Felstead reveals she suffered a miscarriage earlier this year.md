Binky Felstead has revealed she suffered a miscarriage earlier this year.

The Made In Chelsea star, 30, was expecting her second child - her first with fiancé Max Darnton - but sadly miscarried at the 12 week mark, leaving the couple 'heartbroken'.

Binky - who already shares daughter India , three, with her ex Josh Patterson - took to Instagram on Monday evening to post an emotional message to her followers.

'Heartbroken': Binky Felstead has revealed she suffered a miscarriage earlier this year. The Made In Chelsea star, 30, was expecting her second child - her first with fiancé Max Darnton - but sadly miscarried at the 12 week mark

She wrote: 'I’ve thought long and hard about doing this post, but I felt that if I can pass on any warmth, comfort or help to anybody in the same position - well that would be great. It’s only fair that I share some of my “downs” as well as my “up” moments.

'Today would have been my 18 week mark, but sadly we had an early miscarriage just before 12 weeks. Not only was this heartbreaking for us, but it also came as such a shock to me.

'I hadn’t realised until then how blessed I was with having such a relatively straight forward pregnancy with India - I’ll admit I was naive enough to assume the next one would be as straightforward, but I had two early scans as I was concerned I was bleeding. They found a ‘very strong’ heartbeat. However, on the third scan I was told ‘I’m afraid there’s no heartbeat’.

'I was told by my doctor that 1 in 4 pregnancies miscarry (not that statistics make it any easier!) With 82% of my following being women - that means roughly 237,800 women “following” me could (or have) experienced the same, which is just so sad.

'When speaking to a few close friends about our situation, we learned that some of them too have had miscarriages in the past. I asked them why they’ve never said anything, and they just said they felt they couldn't, or shouldn’t talk about it. Almost like it’s a taboo subject, which is heartbreaking.

'If you have been through this, I hope you are giving yourself time to mentally and physically heal and do what you need. I keep reminding myself that there was nothing I could have done, and perhaps this was nature’s way of saying that for whatever reason, this little soul wasn’t ready for the world. Sending so so much love .

'I later learned that @miscarriageassociation is available to help anyone who has/is experiencing this. It’s a national charity that provides support and information for anyone who’s affected by miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, this includes both women and men.

'You can call their helpline or talk to them on live chat or even message them on Instagram, and they will do whatever they can to help you through.'

Support: Binky's MIC co-star Louise Thompson replied with a string of hearts

New chapter: Binky announced she was engaged to Max after 19 months of dating and shared a picture kissing the businessman while holding up her hand to show off the sparkling diamond

Lovely: Max will become India's stepfather

Binky's MIC co-star Louise Thompson replied with a string of hearts.

Binky announced she was engaged to Max, after 19 months of dating and shared a picture kissing the businessman while holding up her hand to show off the sparkling diamond.

Gushing about the proposal, which took place after he asked her daughter India, three, for permission to pop the question, she wrote: 'The easiest 'Yes' EVER!

Cute: The couple are pictured at the Eiffel Tower in Paris

Close: The pair plan to add more children to the family

'On Friday morning, on their way to the duck pond, Max asked India for her permission to ask her mummy to marry him.

'I love you Max - you bring out the best in me. Im so lucky (sic).'

In the sweet snap, Binky passionately kissed her beau after she had accepted his proposal, which took place in a picturesque field at the Long Man of Wilmington.

Earlier this month, Binky and Max threw an intimate engagement party and returned to the not-so romantic scene of their first kiss.

The reality star penned: 'I am beyond lucky to have found someone as caring, protective & loving as you to India and I. I adore the fact you've known her over half her life & have been the most incredible step daddy any little girl could ask for'

Binky and Max have been going strong ever since meeting at separate parties at private members' club Soho Farmhouse in January 2019.

How at least one in six pregnancies ends in a miscarriage One in six pregnancies in women who know they are pregnant become miscarriages. But even more happen among women who don't know they have conceived. Miscarriage occurs when a pregnancy is lost within the first 23 weeks after conception. The main symptoms are bleeding from the vagina, which may be accompanied by lower abdominal pain. There are various reasons women may have a miscarriage – it is common and is not usually caused by something they have done. If a miscarriage happens in the second trimester – between weeks 14 and 26 – it may be a sign of an underlying problem. Often, miscarriages are isolated events and women will go on to have successful pregnancies. The majority of miscarriages can't be prevented, although being generally healthy will help reduce the risk. Losing three or more pregnancies in a row - known as recurrent miscarriages - is uncommon but still affects around one in 100 women. Advertisement

The honest post about the miscarriage comes as several other stars have opened up about their experiences with miscarriage in recent weeks.

Chrissy Teigen and her husband John Legend shared the news of their recent loss publicly, prompting praise from actress Kate Beckinsale, who spoke candidly about how she was forced to deal with her own experience privately.

Chrissy, 34, announced she had tragically lost her third child around halfway into her pregnancy, days after she was admitted to the hospital with severe bleeding.

She revealed she was on 'serious bed rest' due to the bleeding and 'about halfway through her pregnancy', which is around 20-24 weeks. A stillbirth is when a baby is born dead at 24 weeks or later.

Chrissy had previously explained: 'I'm about halfway through pregnancy and the blood has been going on for about a month, maybe a little bit less than a month.

'We're talking about more than your period girls, it's definitely not spotting. A lot of people spot but it's usually fine. Mine was a lot,' she explained.

Teigen had already been on strict bed rest earlier this month but explained she was admitted to the hospital after her bleeding had worsened.

'Everytime I go to the bathroom it would be blood, and honestly just laying there there would be blood.'

Chrissy made the heartbreaking announcement she had lost her child at the end of September, where she shared several devastating photos of herself in the aftermath.

'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we've never felt before,' Chrissy posted on Instagram.

'We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn't enough.'

The couple typically don't name their children until after birth, but Chrissy said they had already started referring to him as Jack.

'We never decide on our babies' names until the last possible moment after they're born, just before we leave the hospital,' she explained.

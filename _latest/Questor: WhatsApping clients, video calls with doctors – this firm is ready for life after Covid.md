  Questor: WhatsApping clients, video calls with doctors – this firm is ready for life after Covid

  It’s tempting to divide companies into those that have suffered during the pandemic, such as airlines, and those that have prospered, such as technology firms.But there is a third category: businesses that suffered in the early stages of the virus crisis but expect to benefit from it in the longer term.IMImobile, the communications firm added to our Inheritance Tax Portfolio of Aim shares in January 2018, is an example.More recently, it said, “we have begun to see a steady recovery in the activity of clients in the worst impacted sectors, alongside continued momentum in our work with core sectors such as banking, mobile operators and logistics”.As a result it has “begun to return furloughed employees to the business and since July 1 has returned all salaries, except those of the board, to normal levels”.

<div><p>It&#8217;s&#160;tempting to divide companies into those that have suffered during the pandemic, such as airlines, and those that have prospered, such as technology firms. But there is a third category: businesses that suffered in the early stages of the virus crisis but expect to benefit from it in the longer term.</p>
<p>IMImobile, the communications firm added to our Inheritance Tax Portfolio of Aim shares in January 2018, is an&#160;example.</p>
<p>It said it had suffered a short-term impact when the pandemic struck and had addressed it with cost-cutting measures such as a hiring freeze, the furloughing of some staff and restrictions on travel, as well as temporary salary reductions, including 33pc for the board.</p>
<p>More recently, it said, &#8220;we have begun to see a steady recovery in the activity of clients in the worst impacted sectors, alongside continued momentum in our work with core sectors such as banking, mobile operators and logistics&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a result it has &#8220;begun to return furloughed employees to the business and since July 1 has returned all salaries, except those of the board, to normal levels&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even more encouragingly, the company said that in the longer term &#8220;we anticipate that the significant&#160;disruption caused will drive and accelerate uptake of our leading technology and services as&#160;large global enterprises increasingly&#160;adopt digital transformation initiatives to improve customer engagement strategies&#8221;.</p>

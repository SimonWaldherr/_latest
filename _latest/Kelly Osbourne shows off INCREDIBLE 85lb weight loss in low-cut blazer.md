She recently revealed she secretly underwent gastric sleeve surgery two years ago, which contributed her impressive 85lb weight loss.

And Kelly Osbourne continued to show off her slimmed-down figure as she headed to a meeting with producer Jeff Beacher in Malibu on Sunday.

The actress, 35, put on a busty display as she slipped into a low-cut blazer jacket, which she styled with ripped jeans to highlight her frame.

Amping up the glamour, The 7D star, who kept safe in a face mask, strutted across a car park in classic patent black heels by Christian Louboutin.

The media personality's signature cat-eye shades and dainty jewellery served as her accessories, while her purple tresses were swept into a ponytail.

On undergoing secret gastric sleeve procedure two years ago, the former Fashion Police judge shared in a recent interview: 'I had surgery. I don't give a f**** what anyone has to say. I did it, I'm proud of it, they can suck s****. I did the gastric sleeve.

'All it does is change the shape of your stomach. I got that almost 2 years ago. I will never ever ever lie about it ever. It is the best thing I have ever done.'

Speaking on Hollywood Raw with Dax Holt and Adam Glyn, the former Australia's Got Talent judge also discussed having injections to change the shape of her face and making her jaw look 'skinnier' after suffering with TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction).

'One thing I did that changed my face,' she added. 'I had really bad TMJ. One of the things they did to stop it was they gave me injections in my jaw. It kinda made my jaw look skinnier.

'That's when people started to notice that I had really lost weight because it changed the shape of everything. I found out Itâ€™s called buckle fat. It changed everything on my face! How the f*** did I not know about this sooner?'

In her 2017 memoir, Kelly wrote about her struggles with weight gain, as well her substance abuse issues, and described herself as having had 'a little dumpling body' which put her off going to the gym and exercising around thinner people.

Earlier this month, Kelly showed off the process of having her tattoos removed from her wrist and forearm.

The TV personality took to Instagram to share a selfie from the studio where she was getting a keyboard, a four-leaf clover and the word 'lovely' taken off her skin.

The daughter of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne also admitted the process was 'worse than getting' the ink done in the first place.

Keeping herself safe amid the coronavirus crisis, the purple-haired beauty wore a blue face mask and sunglasses that protected her eyes as the laser lifted the ink from her skin.

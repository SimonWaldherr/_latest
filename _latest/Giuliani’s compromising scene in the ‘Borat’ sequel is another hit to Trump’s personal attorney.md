<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Of course, Sacha Baron Cohen&#8217;s antics rarely fly under the radar these days, and a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/07/08/rudy-giuliani-called-the-nypd-on-sacha-baron-cohen-over-prank-interview/?_ga=2.266884621.2034868635.1591137614-2003030725.1591137614" target="_blank">report emerged</a> in July that Giuliani had called the police on the comedian after he stormed into the hotel room wearing a wig and pink bikini to stop the interview (which, as it worked out, also stopped Giuliani from doing what we assume he was going to do). But nobody &#8212; probably including Giuliani, even after he identified Cohen &#8212; knew that hidden camera footage of the incident would wind up in &#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,&#8221; streaming Friday on Amazon.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The Giuliani prank is one of many Cohen pulled over the past year while shooting the mockumentary, which follows fictional Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev as he returns to the United States to win over the current presidential administration on behalf of his country. He attempts to present a Trump ally with a bribe &#8212; at first, a monkey; after an unfortunate mishap, his teenage daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) &#8212; and, as one would expect of the inept character, goes about doing so in the most absurd fashion.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Join us as we revisit several unwitting reactions to Cohen&#8217;s latest pranks.

She is number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan.&#8217; That was pretty funny.&#8221;</p><p></p><p><h3 class="font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod">Racist singalong</h3></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">At one point, Cohen crashes a far-right March for Our Rights rally in Olympia, Wash., where he leads the crowd in a singalong for several minutes.

He repeatedly mentioned &#8220;the Wuhan Flu,&#8221; a phrase some lawmakers have used to blame China for the spread of the novel coronavirus, and talked about &#8220;chopping them up like the Saudis do.&#8221; The crowd cheered and joined in.</p></blockquote><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">After the video circulated online, social media users wondered whether Cohen was filming a second season of his Showtime series &#8220;Who Is America?,&#8221; which aired two years ago and also featured the comedian in disguise.

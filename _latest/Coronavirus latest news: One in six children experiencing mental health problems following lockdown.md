<p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on child mental health has been unveiled in a new report.</p>
<p>One in six children experienced mental health problems this summer compared to one in nine three years ago, the data revealed.</p>
<p>The Mental Health of Children and Young People in England 2020 report, published today by NHS Digital, the Office for National Statistics, the National Centre for Social Research, the University of Cambridge and the University of Exeter, looked at the mental health of children and young people in July 2020 compared to the same period in 2017.</p>
<p>Over a third 11 to 16 year olds&#160;(37 per cent) and 17 to 22 year olds (36 per cent) reported that lockdown had made their life a &#8220;little worse&#8221;.</p>
<p>Around one in 20 11 to 16 year olds and 17 to 22 year olds said it&#160;had made their life &#8220;much worse&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>The rate of boys aged 5 to 16 experiencing mental health disorders has risen from 11.4 per cent in 2017 to 16.7 per cent in July 2020.&#160;In girls, it has risen from 10.3 per cent to 15.2 per cent over the same time period.</p>
<p>The report examined risk factors such as family life, education and worries about the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health.</p>
<p>Professor Prathiba Chitsabesan, NHS England Associate National Clinical Director for Children and Young People&#8217;s Mental Health, said:&#160;&#8220;As the whole country continues to find ways to live with the pandemic, many children and young people will be experiencing a range of feelings including anxiety, sadness and loneliness which are understandable responses to such an uncertain and stressful situation.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Simple steps like getting enough sleep, talking to friends or family and ensuring your child has a simple routine can make a huge positive difference."</p>

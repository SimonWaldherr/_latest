<div><p>Susan Sarandon revealed that Cher stole the role intended for Sarandon in their classic film &#8220;The Witches of Eastwick&#8221; &#8212; after Cher had a &#8220;liaison&#8221; with producer Jon Peters.</p>
<p>Sarandon played dowdy teacher Jane in the 1987 movie, with Jack Nicholson as the devil. But in a candid talk with the screenwriter, Michael Cristofer, Sarandon said that she was originally hired to play Cher&#8217;s role of sexy sculptress Alex.</p>
<p>&#8220;I initially was cast in Cher&#8217;s part, and didn&#8217;t find out till I got to LA &#8212; because I was living in Rome &#8212; that I was actually moved to a different part,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;I had to learn suddenly to play the cello, and I had never played an instrument in my life. They said they would sue me if I left, so I didn&#8217;t have much choice!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cher sort of muscled her way into that part,&#8221; Cristofer said. Sarandon replied, &#8220;That&#8217;s Jon &#8230; [He] and Cher had a past liaison or something, so that was another element.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the actresses got along so well that Cher lent her a wig and dress for a scene in which Nicholson seduces her. They also had lunch with Nicholson in his trailer daily.</p>
<p>Sarandon and Cristofer spoke ahead of a fund-raiser for LA&#8217;s Project Angel Food, which will throw a &#8220;Witches of Eastwick&#8221; &#8220;home brewing party&#8221; Saturday, hosted by Sandra Lee.</p>
<p>Sarandon said that she, Cher and co-star Michelle Pfeiffer bonded to survive the shoot, where Peters threw chairs on the set in a temper and director George Miller quit twice.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were a lot of reasons why we could not have gotten along, and everybody took a higher road,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Sarandon also revealed that she turned down a role in &#8220;The First Wives Club,&#8221; which she&#8217;s never seen, saying: &#8220;[It] ended up making a lot of money. It starred all great women, who were getting revenge on their ex-husbands, in the script that I got, by being mean to other women. And I was just like &#8230; who needs that, you know? I don&#8217;t want to be in something where women are tearing down other women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peters and reps for Cher didn&#8217;t comment.</p>

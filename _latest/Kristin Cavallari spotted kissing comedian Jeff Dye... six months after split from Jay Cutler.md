Newly single Kristin Cavallari is dipping her toes in the dating pool.

The 33-year-old indulged in a fun night out in Chicago on Saturday, when she was spotted kissing comedian, Jeff Dye, 37.

The Uncommon James designer let loose in the Fulton Market district before cozying up to the funnyman.

New man: Kristin Cavallari, 33, was spotted kissing comedian Jeff Dye, 37, during a night out in Chicago. Cavallari put on a flirty display, smooching the funnyman before the pair talked very closely

In the video obtained by TMZ, Kristin put on a very flirty display, kissing Dye before they continued to talk very closely.

Earlier in the evening, she and a pal broke open a couple bottles of wine and cooked some dinner, before she headed out on the town.

Though it is unclear, how or when the duo met, the two looked very happy in each other's company.

Dye has been around as a comedian for a while, appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and also emerging as a finalist in the NBC series, Last Comic Standing.

The PDA comes months after she separated from her husband of seven years, former Chicago Bears player, Jay Cutler, 37.

The couple announced their split back in April, with Kristin filing for divorce, citing 'inappropriate marital contact' and 'irreconcilable differences.'

The former Laguna Beach star and Jay have three children together, Camden, eight, Jaxon, six, and daughter Saylor, four.

Cavallari and Cutler continue to co-parent their children in Nashville, both having houses not far from each other.

Divorce: Kristin and Jay separated back in April after seven years of marriage. Upon filing for divorce, Cavallari cited 'inappropriate marital contact' as the reason

Recently, Cutler was linked to Conservative political commentator, Tomi Lahren, 28, after the two were spotted dining together out in Nashville, in early September.

The two were seen passing a bottle of tequila back and forth, before leaving the restaurant together.

Despite the sightings, both Cutler and Lahren have denied any involvement with each other.

  Trump’s Antibody ‘Cure’ Will Be in Short Supply 
description: > 
  Nearly two weeks ago, President Trump told Americans that they would soon be getting an antibody treatment that he had promoted, without evidence, as a “cure” for the coronavirus.This weekend, as the country braced for another major wave of coronavirus infections, Mr. Trump’s health secretary promised such therapies were just around the corner.Even if the drugs are proven to work — still a big if — there’s little chance that they will soon be widely available.The drugs are believed to work best in people who have recently been infected and are not yet very sick.The therapies are promising, he said, but with “everything that’s gone wrong, it’s going to accentuate the problems.”

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Nearly two weeks ago, President Trump told Americans that they would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/us/trump-video-blessing-from-god.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">soon be getting</a> an antibody treatment that he had promoted, without evidence, as a &#8220;cure&#8221; for the coronavirus. This weekend, as the country braced for another major wave of coronavirus infections, Mr. Trump&#8217;s health secretary <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-october-18-2020-n1243845" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promised such therapies</a> were just around the corner.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But these statements are misleading, at best. Even if the drugs are proven to work &#8212; still a big if &#8212; there&#8217;s little chance that they will soon be widely available. A smooth distribution of the antibody treatments will be dependent on the very same factors that have so far bedeviled the country&#8217;s response to Covid-19: fast and plentiful testing, coordination between state and federal officials, and equitable access to health care.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Supply will be extremely limited at first, even though the pool of patients who might benefit is vast, raising messy questions about who should be first in line for treatment. The drugs are believed to work best in people who have recently been infected and are not yet very sick.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;It is just a setup for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wired.com/story/trumps-miracle-cure-for-covid-is-a-logistical-nightmare/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">everything challenging</a> about the pandemic that we&#8217;ve had until now, which is confusion, inequity, delays, reliance on testing,&#8221; said Dr. Walid Gellad, the director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh. The therapies are promising, he said, but with &#8220;everything that&#8217;s gone wrong, it&#8217;s going to accentuate the problems.&#8221;</p></div>

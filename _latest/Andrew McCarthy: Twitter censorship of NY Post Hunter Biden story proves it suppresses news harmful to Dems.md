  Andrew McCarthy: Twitter censorship of NY Post Hunter Biden story proves it suppresses news harmful to Dems 
description: > 
  Twitter and, to a lesser extent, Facebook, suppressed reporting that Joe Biden abetted his son Hunter’s cashing in on the then-vice president’s political influence.Twitter also locked the account of Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, as well as that of the Trump reelection campaign.DOCUMENTS SHOW ALLEGED HUNTER BIDEN SIGNATURE, FBI CONTACTS WITH COMPUTER REPAIR STORE OWNERTwitter’s bogus rationale for the suspensions was the claim that the Biden information had been “hacked” from a laptop computer that appears to have belonged to Hunter.In fact, there is no evidence that the emails, photographs, videos, and other materials on the laptop were hacked or otherwise misappropriated.Plus, Fox News reports that the work order prepared when the computer was dropped off appears to bear Hunter Biden’s signature.

It is not a place where everyone&#8217;s voice is equally welcome; it is a Democratic partisan that occasionally censors information and people it finds politically disagreeable.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS AP</a>P</strong></p><p>Because Twitter poses as a nonpartisan medium of exchange that does not engage in political-viewpoint discrimination, it is struggling to camouflage its suppression of news harmful to Democrats as good-faith, ideologically neutral censorship: portraying its actions as discouragement of cyber-theft, or the purging of &#8220;Russian disinformation&#8221; (another kneejerk claim that&#160;lacks supporting evidence).</p><p>As one would expect, Twitter&#8217;s poor judgment has calls to repeal or drastically amend Section 230 raining down from Washington. To be sure, the provision does need some tinkering, but the rancor against the statute is misplaced. Section 230 states a modest, salutary statutory immunity. The problem here is not the safe harbor; it is that Twitter should not be entitled to its protection unless it meets the qualifying conditions.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/10/washington-can-put-a-stop-to-twitters-game-playing-on-censorship/">CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW</a></strong></p></div>

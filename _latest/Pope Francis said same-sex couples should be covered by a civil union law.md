<p>"What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered," Pope Francis said. "I stood up for that."</p><p>"This is the first time as pope he's making such a clear statement," Rev. James Martin, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pope-meets-with-jesuit-targeted-by-right-for-gay-outreach-2019-9">a Jesuit priest who received criticism for his pro-LGBTQ rights stance,</a>&#160;told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/pope-francis-civil-unions/2020/10/21/805a601c-139e-11eb-a258-614acf2b906d_story.html">The Washington Post</a>. "I think it's a big step forward. In the past, even civil unions were frowned upon in many quarters of the church. He is putting his weight behind legal recognition of same-sex civil unions."</p><p>Pope Francis is viewed as taking a modern approach to his role and promoting progressive reform in the Catholic Church&#8212; making a way for those who have been shunned from the community.&#160;</p><p>&#160;"If someone is gay, and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge?" Pope Francis said, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/world/europe/pope-francis-gay-priests.html">New York Times</a>. His stance differs greatly from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-pope-francis-so-popular-2015-9">his predecessor, Pope Benedict, who called homosexuality "an intrinsic moral evil."</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p>

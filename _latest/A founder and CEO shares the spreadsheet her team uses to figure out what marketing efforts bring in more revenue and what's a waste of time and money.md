<p>In hindsight, marketing agency <a href="https://www.influenceandco.com/">Influence &amp; Co.</a> seemed to be ahead of its time. The marketing and sales team of seven didn't know a global pandemic would soon halt all travel and in-person conferences, but they're glad they already had a solution in place.&#160;</p><p>Three years ago, the company was sending its sales reps to conferences and events to land new clients, but it proved unsustainable over time. The money they were putting into these efforts weren't yielding the results they'd hoped for.&#160;</p><p>That was until the company shifted its focus away from outbound marketing to prioritize inbound efforts, like emails and content creation. The team redistributed all its spending on events and conferences to its inbound budget.&#160;&#160;</p><p>"It really started from seeing that there were some gaps in the systems we were using and we needed a way to tie together marketing and sales to get a very quick, clear picture of what was driving results," founder and CEO, Kelsey Raymond told Business Insider.&#160;</p><h2>A revenue-generating marketing KPI tracker</h2><p>

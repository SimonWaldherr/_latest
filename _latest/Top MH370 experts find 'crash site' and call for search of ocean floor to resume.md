 <p>     </p> <p>No official explanation has been given and it remains one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.</p> <p>One of the leading theories was mass murder-suicide by the pilot.</p> <p>An underwater search - the second of two major searches - came to a halt in the spring of 2018 and there is nothing to suggest it will resume soon.</p> <p>Mr Iannello, one of four experts who worked on the crash site study, said: "I won&#8217;t speak for the other three authors, but I believe there are better than even odds that the plane is within 100 nautical miles (115 miles) of our last estimated point.</p>

 <p>"Any other area has a much lower probability.</p> <p>"Portions of the recommended search area were already searched by GO Phoenix and Ocean Infinity.</p> <p>"Other the portions that were previously searched, some of the data is either missing or of low quality due to the challenging terrain of the sea floor."</p> <p>He added: "We believe another search should occur in the recommended search area.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>"Prior to searching, the existing sonar data in that vicinity should be re-examined to ensure that the debris field was not misclassified as a natural feature."</p> <p>To determine the "highest probability" flight path, Iannello and the other experts - Bobby Ulich, Richard Godfrey and Andrew Banks - developed a model which looked at everything from military and civilian radar to fuel data and drift analysis of MH370 debris that washed up thousands of miles away.</p> <p>They examined 2,300 possible flight paths to identify a probable crash site.</p> <p> The experts have published a <a href="https://mh370.radiantphysics.com/2020/03/09/new-report-released-for-mh370-search/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">technical report</a> to guide the next search for a debris field on the floor of the Southern Indian Ocean. </p>

 <p>They believe the plane flew 115 miles west of Banda Aceh, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, after it was turned around en route to China and flown back across Malaysia.</p> <p>Systems were switched off so the plane could not be tracked.</p> <p>The experts suspect MH370 then flew south for 2,700 miles before crashing and disintegrating in the Indian Ocean, west of Australia.</p> <p>Last March, as they held a remembrance ceremony on the sixth anniversary of the disappearance, relatives of the 239 people who were on board called on Malaysia to revive efforts to find the plane.</p> <img>

<p>Lawyer Grace Nathan, whose mum Anne Daisy was on board the plane, is among the family members calling for the search to resume.</p> <p>She told Mirror Online: "We believe that unless the plane is found we will not know what happened or why it happened, and therefore we will not be able to prevent it from happening again."</p> <p>French businessman Ghyslain Wattrelos, whose wife Laurence, 51, and two of his children, Hadrien, 17, and Ambre, 13, were on the doomed jet, has echoed those calls.</p> <p>He urged Malaysia to reveal what happened to the plane, telling Mirror Online earlier this year: "We cannot accept what they are telling us. We cannot just say, 'yes, this plane has disappeared'.</p>

 <p>"This plane has not disappeared, it is not a mystery, so please tell us what happened."</p> <p>Malaysia, China and Australia ended a two-year, &#163;101.86 million underwater search in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane.</p> <p>In 2018, Ocean Infinity, an American marine robotics company with bases in Austin, Texas, and Southampton, Hampshire, was contracted by the Malaysian government to carry out an underwater search on a &#8220;no-cure, no-fee&#8221; basis.</p> <p>It meant Malaysia would pay the firm up to $70 million (&#163;53.5 million) if it found the plane. But the 138-day search was fruitless.</p> <p>Mr Iannello, an engineer and entrepreneur who is CEO of Radiant Physics in Roanoke, Virginia, said Ocean Infinity is best-placed to lead the next search.</p>

 <p>He added: "Based on the contractual conditions of the last search, a new search would be contingent on both the willingness of a private company to assume the financial risk of not finding the debris field and the willingness of Malaysia to offer a reward if the debris field is found.</p> <p>"The only private company that I am aware of that has the expertise, resources, and willingness to consider this arrangement is Ocean Infinity."</p> <p>Pieces of confirmed or suspected debris have been found on the French island of Reunion and on coastlines in Mozambique and Madagascar.</p> <p>Mr Iannello said: "It is possible that additional debris from MH370 will be found.</p> <p>"Unfortunately, the timing and location of that debris is unlikely to provide additional information about the impact point, as the longer the debris is afloat, the harder it is to use drift models to relate the debris to a particular impact point along the 7th&#160;arc."</p> <p>Mr Iannello is a member of the Independent Group (IG), the leading non-government analysis team looking into the disappearance of MH370. The group helped Australian officials searching for the missing aircraft.</p> <p>After analysing all the known evidence, he suspects the plane was deliberately turned around and flown over the sea until it crashed.</p>

 <p>He said: "I won&#8217;t speak for other IG members and other collaborators. I believe the evidence points to a deliberate diversion by the crew rather than an accident sequence or diversion by passengers."</p> <p>One of the leading theories was Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane and deliberately crashed it into the ocean in a carefully planned mass murder-suicide plot.</p> <p>There was a suspicion that the pilot, who flew a similar path on his flight simulator at home, was clinically depressed.</p> <p>In July 2018, Malaysia's 495-page official report said the Boeing 777&#8217;s controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course, but investigators could not determine who was responsible.</p>

 <p>The report also highlighted mistakes made by the Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City air traffic control centres and issued recommendations to avoid a repeat incident.</p> <p>Investigators stopped short of offering any conclusions about what happened to MH370, saying that depended on finding the plane&#8217;s wreckage.</p> <p>Malaysia's government said it will consider resuming the search only when credible new evidence is found.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Transport said: "The Government of Malaysia reiterates that the aspiration to locate MH370 has not been abandoned.</p> <p>"Should credible new information emerge which can be used to identify the specific location of the aircraft, consideration will be given in determining future search operations and re-establishment of the investigation team."</p> <p>Mirror Online has contacted Ocean Infinity for comment.</p> <p>In February, Ocean Infinity chief executive officer Oliver Plunkett told Reuters that &#8220;no new search is imminent&#8221;, but the firm continues to engage with experts to identify where any new search might be launched.</p> <p>He added: &#8220;The Malaysian Government, rightly in our view, set a high bar before they will engage in that discussion."</p> <p>&#8220;It was and remains our position that we hope to be able to offer our services to the Malaysian government again at some point in the future.&#8221;</p></div>

Mark Lipscomb, vice president of global talent at Adobe, said that the creative software company puts a premium on humility and the ability to constantly learn when interviewing candidates.

Adobe's interviews are structured around three traits it wants employees to have: Creativity, focus, and leadership.

The company is currently hundreds of positions, especially in engineering.

Mark Lipscomb had an unconventional start to HR. He served two tours in the Middle East right out of college as a naval officer, had a short stint as a lacrosse coach at Stanford University, and stumbled his way into HR by complaining about his employer's existing HR team.

"It was the Department of No," he said. "I said, 'Well isn't HR supposed to be about getting employees excited about coming into work everyday?' It was more like the principal's office at the time."

After that company tasked him with fixing his own issues with the department, Lipscomb eventually began hopping around Silicon Valley, taking HR gigs at Tesla, Netflix, and 23andMe. In May 2019, he signed on to become Adobe's vice president of global talent after the firm won him over by emphasizing humility. It's not something that every firm puts a premium on, after all:

"In Silicon Valley — how do I put this a nice way? — there might be a sense of entitlement," Lipscomb said.

With Adobe's humility comes a deep focus on the ability to constantly learn.

"Humility is what allows you to continue to question and learn new things and be self-aware about what you know, what you don't know," Lipscomb said.

The firm itself has dealt with this need first-hand:

"In the Valley, you might look at Adobe and think this is a quote-unquote old company, and then you realize, well obviously, this is the company that was [one of] the first few on the cloud," he said. "And in order to do that, it had to be willing to question how it did business itself."

Indeed, Adobe was known for selling photo- and video-editing software like Photoshop and Premiere Pro on discs before successfully pivoting to the cloud in 2011. It now charges either a monthly or annual subscription fee for its suite of creative software tools, and has boosted its market cap to $241 billion. As the company continues to expand its capabilities, like through using artificial intelligence to upgrade the PDF format it pioneered decades ago, it's hiring for hundreds of employees, especially in engineering.

Here's what an Adobe recruiter is looking for in a candidate, according to Lipscomb:

Because of the emphasis on humility, an inflated ego is definitely a red flag, while people who express interest in pushing boundaries are embraced, he said. Adobe primarily focuses on three core capabilities that it wants all its employees to posses: creativity, focus, and leadership. In each round of the interview process, interviewers ask questions constructed around one of the capabilities to gauge how candidates stack up.

Ultimately though, Adobe doesn't have a specific "Adobe way," according to Lipscomb, because it thrives off of learning new practices, experimenting, and never resting on its laurels.

In that vein, the coronavirus forced Adobe to change a long-standing hiring practice: The company was previously adamant about meeting candidates in person before giving them an offer. The pandemic quickly forced Adobe to abandon that precedent, and it hired and onboarded roughly 700 interns virtually in the spring (400 of whom ultimately became full-time employees).

Lipscomb said while the company puts a premium on humility, coronavirus lockdowns have put a greater focus on the ability to work independently, and he continues to look for that skill in candidates.

"As a leader, you're giving your team more autonomy, you're not watching over them every day," he said. "And most people that perform well, they don't want to micromanage. So there's just this sense of independence, which I think is very healthy."

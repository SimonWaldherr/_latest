  Trump tells Pennsylvania rally 'nobody wants me' before cutting event short and dancing off stage to YMCA 
description: > 
  In one of his most bizarre and incoherent performances to date, president Donald Trump on Tuesday night told a Pennsylvania rally "nobody wants me" before cutting the event short and dancing off the stage to YMCA.Just last week, he begged suburban women to "please like me" as he sought to recover ground among female voters, who overwhelmingly favour Mr Biden, 77.What I've gone through – the drug companies, they're spending a fortune on fake ads," Mr Trump told his fans.Just minutes after telling Pennsylvania he didn’t want to be there, Mr Trump then announced he would be cutting the rally short because of the cold.Meanwhile, Mr Biden has kept a low profile in recent days and is thought to be preparing for Thursday's third and final presidential debate.

</p><p>Outmuscled financially and trailing Joe Biden in most national and battleground polls, Mr Trump did not appear to be his usual energetic self, as he addressed thousands of <a href="/topic/make-america-great-again">Make America Great Again</a> supporters crammed into a chilly and dark Erie International Airport.</p><p></p><p>Two weeks out from election day the president, 74, complained about the temperature, which had been hovering around 10C (50F) telling the crowd he was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-rally-polls-erie-pennsylvania-coronavirus-pandemic-b1196763.html">only there because he was losing</a>, a highly unusual move &#8211; even for a president as unpredictable as Mr Trump.</p><p id="article-im-prompt"></p><p>At one point, the commander-in-chief appeared to be trying to get the crowd to feel sorry for him, telling them "nobody wants me". Just last week, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/trump-rally-pennsylvania-pleads-suburban-women-us-election-biden-b1030464.html">he begged suburban women</a> to "please like me" as he sought to recover ground among female voters, who overwhelmingly favour Mr Biden, 77.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Really, I can't believe it.

Footage from the rally shows the president with his feet planted firmly to the ground while bending alternate knees and punching the air.
</p><p></p><p>His press secretary, Kayleigh McEnancy could be seen following the famous dance to the letter, as she spelt out the words the letters 'YMCA' with her arms.
</p><p>On Wednesday night, Mr Trump will head to North Carolina, another crucial battleground state where polls show a tight race between the two candidates.

The UFC has released the poster for its Oct. 31 event headlined by, what could be, Anderson Silva’s final fight, according to Dana White.

Silva will take on Uriah Hall on Halloween night at the UFC APEX in Las Vegas, the promotion’s first fight card following their five-week trip to Abu Dhabi.

White spoke with the media in August following a Contender Series event and revealed the 185-pound matchup and, while it’s not 100-percent, stated that after conversations with Silva’s team this could be the last hurrah for one of the greatest to step foot in the octagon.

“I met with his managers the other day, this will be his last fight,” White told reporters. “I think he’s going to retire.”

“The Spider” has dropped six of his last seven fights and will look for his first win since getting a unanimous decision over Derek Brunson at UFC 208 in February 2017. The 45-year-old became champion with a first-round knockout win over Rich Franklin at UFC 64 in October 2007 and defended the title 10-times before losing it to Chris Weidman at UFC 162 in July 2013.

In his last two bouts, Silva dropped a unanimous decision to Israel Adesanya, and lost via first-round injury TKO to Jared Cannonier.

Hall will look to make it three straight wins after picking up a TKO of Bevon Lewis at UFC 232 and a split decision over Antonio Carlos Junior in September 2019. “Prime Time” had been booked twice against Ronaldo Souza but both bouts were cancelled due to COVID-19 circumstances. Hall was also scheduled to face Yoel Romero at UFC Vegas 7 and that fight was also cancelled following a Romero injury.

Salesforce has a big ecosystem of customers and partners which has created the need for people trained to manage and build upon the technology.

To help build a pipeline of candidates for these position, Salesforce created a free online learning platform called Trailhead and a system of certifications.

The increasing popularity of Salesforce's software has spawned a host of jobs for people who can manage and build upon the technology, both at the firm's customers and its reselling partners. In fact, the Salesforce ecosystem is expected to create 4.2 million new jobs worldwide between 2019 and 2024, according to a 2019 research report from IDC.

To help build a pipeline of candidates for these positions, Salesforce created a free online learning platform called Trailhead, while several tech staffing agencies and training programs have popped up to help people prepare for these role as well.

Once people undergo training, they typically take a Salesforce certification course either online or in-person, which generally costs between $200 and $400 (the pandemic has notably limited options to take tests in-person). Some Salesforce partners also have bootcamps where they pay people to take trainings and exams.

A Salesforce admin role — through the admin certification — is typically the first job someone gets in the ecosystem and from there they can complete more specialized certifications, like for Marketing Cloud software.

We also looked at federal salary data for 994 roles with Salesforce in the job title that American companies have to disclose when they apply for visas for current or prospective foreign workers, to see what these roles typically pay. The data collected and published by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification only includes base salaries for foreign workers and the roles they were hired for, but it is a rare snapshot into what some of these jobs pay.

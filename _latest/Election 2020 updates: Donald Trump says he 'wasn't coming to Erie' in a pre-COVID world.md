I wasn't coming to Erie. I mean, I have to be honest: There's no way I was coming....I would have called you and said, &#8216;Hey, Erie, you know, if you have a chance get out and vote,&#8217;&#8221; Trump said to laughter from the audience.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We had this thing won," Trump asserted about the election, "and then we got hit with the plague and I had to go back to work. &#8216;Hello, Erie, may I please have your vote?&#8217;&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Trump joked about the cold weather and spent less time on stage than usual, just about an hour. He&#8217;s made similar remarks about the weather as he has stepped up his schedule considerably in recent days, telling a rally audience in Wisconsin this weekend that he wasn&#8217;t speaking on a "freezing night with 45 degree winds" because it was fun.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Think I'm doing this for my health?&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Polls show Trump is running slightly behind in battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Nationally, 58% of voters disapprove of how Trump has handled the virus, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll earlier this month, a figure that has been essentially unchanged since the summer.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Even if the virus had not struck the U.S. as hard as it has and raised questions about his administration's response, Trump almost certainly would have campaigned in Pennsylvania. He held one of his first rallies there after becoming president in 2017 and held at least four political events in the state in 2018.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8212; John Fritze</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a id="gpd-1603218546549"></a>Amy Coney Barrett: Full Senate to vote on Supreme Court confirmation on Monday</h2><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-elections-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate will vote on Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s confirmation to the Supreme Court on Monday, likely allowing Barrett to take her place as the ninth justice just days before Election Day.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Kentucky Republican outlined a schedule at his weekly news conference Tuesday that would mean the Senate would remain in session this weekend to debate her confirmation before voting on Monday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We'll be voting to confirm justice to-be Barrett next Monday,&#8221; McConnell said.

After four days of hearings and hours of questioning by senators last week, a vote on her nomination is set to be taken up by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The hearings were largely without controversy or drama, allowing Barrett to retain enough Republican support that is likely to lead to her confirmation.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">McConnell plans to take up her confirmation on Friday, setting up two days of debate over the weekend and a final vote by the chamber on Monday &#8211;&#160;eight days before the election.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8211; Christal Hayes&#160;</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a id="gpd-1603215913938"></a>COVID stimulus update: Pelosi backs away from deadline</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to back away from a&#160;Tuesday deadline&#160;to reach a deal on a&#160;COVID-19 stimulus&#160;plan before the election.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Pelosi said in an interview with Bloomberg her Tuesday ultimatum was not actually a deadline to have a deal but in fact "the day where we would have our terms on the table, to be able to go to the next step."&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-elections-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Asked how a bill could come together, Pelosi left open the possibility a bill might not be passed until after the election, saying "we could still continue the negotiations.

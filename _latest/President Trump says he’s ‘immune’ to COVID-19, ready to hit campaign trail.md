President Trump said he is now “immune” to the coronavirus after beating the disease — and is ready to hit the campaign trail again with the all clear from his physician.

“It seems like I’m immune, so I can go way out of a basement, which I would have done anyway,” Trump said on “Sunday Morning Futures” when asked by Maria Bartiromo about the White House doctor’s not that he was no longer contagious.

“The president is in very good shape to fight the battles,” Trump added. “I beat this crazy horrible China virus… I passed the highest test, the highest standards, and I’m in great shape. And I have to tell you I feel fantastically. I really feel good.”

The president said he doesn’t know how long he is immune — “maybe a long time, maybe a short time. It could be a lifetime. Nobody really knows, but I’m immune.”

“I even feel good by the fact that, you know, the word ‘immunity’ means something,” he added. “Having really a protective glow means something. I think it’s very important to have that. To have that is a very important thing.”

Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive on Thursday, Oct. 1, two days after the presidential debate with former Vice President Joe Biden.

On that Friday he traveled to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for three days of treatment before returning to the White House.

His doctor, Sean Conley, wrote in a memo released by the White House on Saturday that the president is no longer contagious.

“This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the President meeting the CDC criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning’s COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” the memo said.

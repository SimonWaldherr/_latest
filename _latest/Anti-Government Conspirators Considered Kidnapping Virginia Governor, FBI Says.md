Special Agent Richard Trask testified during a court hearing in Michigan that the members of the paramilitary groups did not name Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam but "discussed possible targets, taking a sitting governor, specifically issues with the governor of Michigan and Virginia based on the lockdown orders."

He added that people at the meeting in Ohio were unhappy with the governors' responses to the coronavirus pandemic.

Trask was part of the investigation that led to the arrest of 13 men last week, including some in connection with plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Associated Press reported .

He did not discuss any further planning targeting Northam and it was not clear whether any plans targeting the Virginia governor went beyond the June meeting.

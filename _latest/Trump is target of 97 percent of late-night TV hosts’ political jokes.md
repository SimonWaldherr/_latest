  Trump is target of 97 percent of late-night TV hosts’ political jokes 
description: > 
  Late-night TV hosts show clear bias in making President Trump the target of almost all of their political jokes — while Joe Biden escapes virtually unscathed, according to a new study.In September, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon made Trump the punchline of 97% of their jokes about the candidates, with 455 about the president compared to just 14 about his Democratic rival.“When Trump’s onstage, everyone else is blacked out,” said Robert Lichter, a communication professor at George Mason.Mason has been studying late-night humor and politics since 1992, and says that while the hosts usually target Republicans more than Democrats, the difference has never been this stark.“I think they will find a way to keep making jokes about Trump, even after he leaves office,” Lichter said.

<p>In September, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon made Trump the punchline of 97% of their jokes about the candidates, with 455 about the president compared to just 14 about his Democratic rival.</p>
<p>The bias is even greater if you counted the 64 jokes that month that the pair made about Trump&#8217;s family or administration, according to the study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Trump&#8217;s onstage, everyone else is blacked out,&#8221; said Robert Lichter, a communication professor at George Mason.</p>
<p>Mason has been studying late-night humor and politics since 1992, and says that while the hosts usually target Republicans more than Democrats, the difference has never been this stark.</p>
<p>Even four years ago, Trump had a fairer shake, getting poked fun of 78% of the time compared to Hillary Clinton&#8217;s 22%, the center said.</p>
<p>The bias is so pronounced, in fact, Biden will probably continue to get off free even if he wins the election, the professor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they will find a way to keep making jokes about Trump, even after he leaves office,&#8221; Lichter said.</p>

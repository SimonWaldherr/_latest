<p>The number of voters who were told to leave was not immediately known, but Thompson said it was only a few. The poll worker thought the statements were tied to the Democratic Party, Thompson said.</p><p>&#8220;That was pretty bad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They were not supposed to be turned away.&#8221;</p><p>Early voter turnout ahead of the Nov. 3 election has been strong in Memphis and throughout Tennessee. Early voting ends Oct. 29 in the state.</p><p id="inline-newsletter_placeholder"></p>

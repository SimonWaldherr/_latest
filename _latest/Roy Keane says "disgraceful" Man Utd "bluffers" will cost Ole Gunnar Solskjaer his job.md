Roy Keane says Manchester United's "disgraceful" players will cost Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his job.

United legend Keane labelled Red Devils stars "bluffers" after their 6-1 humbling at the hands of Tottenham.

Keane launched a now infamous rant during United's 1-1 draw with Spurs last season, after the coronavirus lockdown, and has again torn into his former side.

Ahead of England vs Wales, he told ITV: “I've been saying it for the last 12 months, year and a half, their performance against Spurs was disgraceful.

"You all have bad days in football. Some of the players were a disgrace to the Man United badge.

"Too many bluffers and ultimately, these players will cost Ole his job. The players he has got there - they threw the previous manager under the bus. They will do the same to Ole.”

Keane's former teammate Patrice Evra was a pundit on Sky Sports' coverage of the Spurs game, and was visibly upset with the performance.

He said: "Are you seeing this right now?

"That's why I don't even want to talk about this game because it's a catastrophe what's happening right now.

"My advice to any fan right now is to buy a PlayStation, buy a player like Sancho, even Messi, and start playing. Because it's a disaster.

"You know I've been a player, that's why I don't want to go on about one player, but our defence has been shocking.

"Bailly had the chance to play instead of Lindelof and he made that mistake. So don't cry when you don't play!

"This is so naive. I'm devastated. And I'm a positive person. But right now I understand the pain of all United fans because no one right now in this team deserves to play."

It awards all of a state&#8217;s electors to the candidate with the most votes, no matter how small the margin of victory. Critics say that means millions of votes are effectively ignored.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The fairness of the Electoral College was seriously questioned in the 1960s. Amid the civil rights push, changes to the system were framed as the last step of democratization. But a constitutional amendment to introduce a national popular vote for president was eventually killed by segregationist senators in 1970.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Desire for an overhaul dwindled until the elections of 2000 and 2016, when the system&#8217;s flaws again came to the fore. In both instances, the men who became president had lost the popular vote.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Jesse Wegman, a member of The Times&#8217;s editorial board, describes how the winner-take-all system came about and how the Electoral College could be modified.</p></div>

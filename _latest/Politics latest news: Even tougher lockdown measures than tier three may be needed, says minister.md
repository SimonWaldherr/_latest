Robert Jenrick has raised the prospect of further restrictions, before the latest measures have even come into force, after Prof Chris Whitty warned that the baseline would not be "sufficient".

From Wednesday, England will be split into "medium", "high" and "very high" coronavirus alert levels, with Merseyside the only region placed in the highest category, banning household mixing, while bars and pubs will be closed unless they can operate as restaurants

But the Housing Secretary told Sky News: "We may have to go even further than we have announced but want to make sure measures work for the local community themselves... We probably need to go even further, but we want to design those steps between ourselves and local leaders."

Mr Jenrick suggested that Manchester had escaped the most restrictive measures because of pressure from local leaders, saying they had "influenced" the measures, but that talks were ongoing.

Sage scientists including Calum Semple, a University of Liverpool professor, were calling for a circuit breaker as early as yesterday afternoon.

The Chief Medical Officer, standing next to the Prime Minister, warned "the base will not be sufficient, I think that's very clearly the professional view".

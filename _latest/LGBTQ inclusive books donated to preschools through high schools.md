The group has&#160;been donating even more books this year&#160;during the pandemic.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Though many classes are virtual, some LGBTQ students&#160;attending school&#160;this fall are&#160;returning to their biggest support systems and havens: teachers and their curriculums.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Research shows having LGBTQ storylines in the classroom impacts all students, not just those who think they may be&#160;LGBTQ. Students in schools with LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum are 82%&#160;more likely to report that their classmates are accepting of LGBTQ people than students in schools without LGBTQ-inclusive curriculums, according&#160;to the <a href="https://www.glsen.org/research/2015-national-school-climate-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">GLSEN National School Climate&#160;Survey</a>. <strong>&#160;</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A&#160;recent <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2020/?section=Finding-Support" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">survey</a> from The Trevor Project,&#160;a national group focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ youths, also shows that positive school environments make&#160;the biggest difference in kids' lives, compared to other environments such as&#160;the home, the&#160;community&#160;and work settings.&#160;&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When Forman used to work as a preschool teacher,&#160;she said&#160;she was&#160;struck by how quickly kids&#160;ingested new knowledge and developed new ways of thinking. That's why it's important to introduce children to characters who&#160;have two moms or two dads&#160;and characters who express gender outside of the male-female binary, she said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Something else clicked for Forman&#160;when she and Damante watched&#160;the comedy-drama series "Glee" together when it premiered in 2009: it was obvious that&#160;Damante identified&#160;with LGBTQ&#160;storylines more than others.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;If we start with this next generation of young kids and we make it so that it&#8217;s normal, it&#8217;s just a fact, it&#8217;s not anything unusual. Then a whole new generation of people&#160;will be just fine with it, and people will feel comfortable," she said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NohuK7Icu5g&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Pride and Less Prejudice</a> sends book bundles to any educator in the U.S. or Canada who requests them for use in their class. In addition to international requests from multiple Canadian provinces, Forman said she has also received requests for books and resources from Australia, Denmark&#160;and&#160;Angola. So far, the group has&#160;sent books to schools in 22 states and received requests from teachers in 37 states.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/hope-in-a-box-lgbtq-literature" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Hope In A Box</a>, a similar group founded in 2018, gives free literature and curriculums&#160;with LGBTQ characters, themes&#160;or authors to middle and high school English classes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Its founder, Joe English, said&#160;he created the group because LGBTQ acceptance is a matter of life and death. English, 25,&#160;describes the&#160;threat of violence&#160;LGBTQ youths face as&#160;"real and pressing," especially in&#160;rural schools, which make up 90% of the group's partner schools.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">English&#160;said&#160;90%&#160;of teachers he works with&#160;tell him&#160;their LGBTQ students are physically harassed because of&#160;their identity. Two-thirds&#160;say their LGBTQ students have been punched or kicked in the last year, he said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">With many classes held&#160;virtually, English said&#160;"it is even more important than normal that they feel safe and welcome and included," in educational settings where they can claim representation in books and lessons.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Students gather for the 10th annual Gay Youth Pride Day parade sponsored by The Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth at Copley Square in Boston."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">LGBTQ youths need representation in kid-centered spaces</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For&#160;Damante, 25, finding LGBTQ-inclusive spaces was hard when she was a kid&#160;in New Jersey.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I didn&#8217;t have access to things like Pride where I was growing up," she said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Damante recalls how she&#160;and a straight high-school classmate&#160;went to an LGBTQ bowling meet-up to try to make more queer friends their age.&#160;They soon left,&#160;disappointed when they realized the event was attended entirely by adults.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Until college, Damante said she mostly found&#160;herself represented in television and movies. Those included slightly more <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/08/17/bisexual-character-animated-owl-house-disney-tv-series-rarity/3387896001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">gay, lesbian, and bisexual&#160;characters</a>&#160;in recent years, although, she notes&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/07/16/glaad-film-report-more-lgbtq-characters-but-lack-screen-time/5448718002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">transgender characters are still lacking</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Bringing books with LGBTQ protagonists and families to children is about helping people see themselves and their loved ones in&#160;ways that are both new and more true-to-life, Damante said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"When you really think about how you were socialized, there&#8217;s a lot of things that are missing that you don&#8217;t realize until you&#8217;re much older," she&#160;said. "A lot of people don&#8217;t realize that these books are out there."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">India&#160;Macdonald, 19, was one of the first students to receive books from Hope In A Box when she was a high school student in Topeka, Kansas. Before then, "reading and&#160;watching TV and&#160;movies&#160;secretly in my bedroom&#160;was so important," she said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Macdonald, who is&#160;a lesbian, said one of her favorite Hope In A Box books is&#160;"The Miseducation of Cameron Post"&#160;by Emily M. Danforth. The novel tells the story of a 12-year-old girl living in Montana who goes to live with her aunt and grandmother after her parents die in a car crash. The protagonist explores relationships with other girls, which creates&#160;tension among the town's religious community.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She felt a sense of relief when her English teacher incorporated&#160;books such as&#160;Danforth's&#160;as part of a&#160;unit on gender studies, Macdonald said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"When your teacher brings this into the classroom, that communicates to you that this is not something you need to hide or feel weird about," India said.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Schools&#160;can't always afford inclusive&#160;curriculums</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When Jack Meyers, 27, taught third grade in Franklin Township, New Jersey, it was cost prohibitive to get "anything other than absolutely the basics," he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Meyers said the students at the public elementary school where he taught are&#160;mostly Black and Latino. The school is also&#160;Title I&#160;&#8211; an institution&#160;receiving&#160;financial aid so&#160;low-income students can meet academic standards &#8211; just like 45% of schools supported by Pride and Less Prejudice.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Meyers says he and his colleagues felt pressure to resort to curriculums his school already had on hand because of a lack of funding.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Those end up being&#160;Eurocentric, white-washed version of life," he said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Meyers, who started receiving books from Pride and Less Prejudice in November 2019, said&#160;books such as "Cuando Amamos Cantamos: When We Love Someone We Sing to Them" by&#160;Ernesto Javier Mart&#237;nez&#160;helped him be a better teacher.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"As teachers, we&#160;need&#160;to understand that if we don&#8217;t think critically about the kinds of texts we&#8217;re using in the classroom, we are subconsciously promoting the status quo," he said.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Inclusive media may be most important for non-LGBTQ students</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For Drake Brown, who is straight, volunteering&#160;as&#160;Digital Chair for Hope In A Box meant taking his allyship to the next level.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I&#8217;ve&#160;been fortunate enough to grow up with a gay uncle who happens to be one of my biggest role models," Brown, 23, said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Brown, who attended&#160;school in rural New Jersey,&#160;said he never&#160;engaged with LGBTQ people or material in class.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-6" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He said&#160;he always felt a disconnect between the stories his uncle told him about&#160;LGBTQ people fighting for civil rights&#160;and what he his teachers taught him.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"While you may not have many LGBTQ people in your classroom, that&#8217;s not an accurate depiction of what society really is when you step outside your community and your bubble," he said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Brown is also Black and said&#160;this year's national spotlight on racial injustice points to a similar disconnect: "A lot of folks don&#8217;t really empathize with our struggles because they don&#8217;t visually see them in their day-to-day. But it&#8217;s as simple as turning your television on," he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Follow Claire Thornton on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/claire_thornto" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">@claire_thornto</a>.&#160;&#160;</p></div>

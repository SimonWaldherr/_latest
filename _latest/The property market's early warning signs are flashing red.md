<div><p>House prices are soaring, either <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/house-prices/house-prices-jump-73pc-september-nearly-250000-boom-cant-last/">up 7.3pc in the last year</a>, according to building society Halifax, or <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/house-prices/house-prices-jump-5pc-year/">by 5pc</a> if you ask Nationwide.&#160;</p>
<p>But those top-line numbers don&#8217;t tell the whole story. In fact, given the market is forecast to fall off a cliff in the not-too-distant future, they are quite misleading.</p>
<p>The frustrating thing for property market watchers is that all these figures tell us what happened a few weeks or even months ago, because of the slow nature of buying a property and the way that data is reported on a lag. Official house price data is always&#160;released&#160;on a delay, so the "latest" numbers&#160;reflect what happened in August.&#160;</p>
<p>To understand what is happening right now, it&#8217;s important to look for the signal through the noise.</p>
<p>We must pick up on anecdotal evidence, think laterally&#160;and rely on more subtle indicators. At the moment these are far more important &#8211; and suggest that the market that defied experts&#8217; expectations is already running out of steam. The early warning signs are now flashing red.</p>
<p>While mortgage approvals may be up &#8211; in August, they hit a 13-year high &#8211; the sheer lack of low-deposit mortgages available is the more important factor. TSB has said that it will only offer mortgages to those with more than 40pc deposits, essentially cutting out any buyers except equity-rich second-steppers. According to UK Finance, the trade body, the average mortgage has a 32pc deposit.</p>
<p>You may think this is just one bank&#8217;s caution, but it reflects the subtle but crucial&#160;change&#160;to what makes up an "ordinary" homeowner, which will shape the whole property market.</p>
<p>And it is a rising trend among lenders, which are becoming far more risk averse as unemployment rises. Last week <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/15/jobs-crisis-trigger-spike-mortgage-defaults-bank-warns/">the Bank of England warned of a spike in mortgage defaults</a>.&#160;</p>

<div><p>The quality of a community&#8217;s schools is central to any family&#8217;s aspirations. Public education has largely been a local matter for school boards and states that allocate most of their funding.

Bush put in place requirements that schools demonstrate &#8220;adequate yearly progress&#8221; based on standardized student testing.

It&#8217;s followed by New Jersey, Florida, Washington and New Hampshire to round out the top five. Seven of the 10 states with the best education systems also rank among the top 10 Best States overall.</p><p>Explore more about the best state for education below.</p></div>

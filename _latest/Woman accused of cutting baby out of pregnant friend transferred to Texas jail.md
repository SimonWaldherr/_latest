The woman accused of killing her pregnant friend and cutting the unborn child from the victim’s womb was transferred to a Texas jail on Wednesday.

Taylor Parker, 27, was jailed in Idabel, Oklahoma, following her alleged murder of Reagan Hancock, 21, in a home in New Boston, Texas, last Friday.

Parker was moved to the Bi-State Detention Center in Texarkana, where she is being held without bond on capital murder, murder and kidnapping charges.

The alleged murder landed in Oklahoma after she was stopped later Friday by a Texas trooper with Hancock’s baby inside her car. She said she had just given birth and the baby was not breathing, authorities have said.

The trooper called an ambulance and the pair was taken across state lines to a hospital in Oklahoma.

There, doctors told investigators it wasn’t possible that Parker had given birth, which led authorities to link Parker to Hancock.

Hancock was eight months pregnant and was discovered by her mom, her family has said. A fundraiser said her attacker was “someone Reagan considered a friend.”

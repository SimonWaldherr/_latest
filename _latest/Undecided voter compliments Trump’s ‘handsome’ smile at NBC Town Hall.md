President Trump got more than just questions from undecided voters at his Thursday night town hall.

One undecided voter, Paulette Dale, showered the president with compliments about his “handsome” smile before asking him a question about US immigration policies.

“Good evening, Mr. President. I have to say you have a great smile,” Dale said, herself grinning from ear to ear.

“You’re so handsome when you smile,” gushed Dale, a registered Republican who indicated she was leaning towards voting for Vice President Joe Biden.

The president, continuing to smile, thanked Dale and the audience erupted into a round of applause.

Dale’s gesture drew swift reactions on Twitter.

“Paulette Dale! What a sweetheart,” wrote Twitter user Tyler Gillean.

Another user, Marta Munson, wrote, “I think our President was blushing.”

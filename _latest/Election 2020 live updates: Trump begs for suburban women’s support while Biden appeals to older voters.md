Former Democratic congressman Beto O’Rourke said his grass-roots group helped make nearly 3 million calls to Texas voters one day before the start of early voting in the state, which began Tuesday.

In a massive phone-banking operation dubbed “Calling Texas,” O’Rourke deployed celebrities and high-profile Democrats to rally volunteers who by the day’s end made, O’Rourke tweeted, 2,942,597 calls.

O’Rourke said the phone banking event started with a goal about a third of the size.

“We set a goal to make more than 1 million calls today to Texas voters head of the first day of early voting, which is tomorrow, in the biggest swing state, in the most important election of our lives,” O’Rourke said in a video posted Monday evening, hours after the phone banking began. “And thanks to all of the amazing volunteers … we have made almost 1.5 million so far and we’re going to reset the target to 2 million.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro and former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang joined to encourage volunteers. Oprah Winfrey and Willie Nelson made appearances, too.

“As you may know, early voting begins tomorrow,” Winfrey said on the phone to a voter in a video posted to O’Rourke’s Facebook page. “On a scale from zero to 10, zero being I’m never going to vote and 10 being I’m definitely voting, what number describes you?”

The voter responded: “I’m an 11, I’m already there tomorrow."

Throughout the virtual phone-banking event and on social media, O’Rourke, the special guests and others with his political action committee, Powered by People, have been pushing to get people to vote for Democrats down the ballot in the state that President Trump won by nine points in 2016.

A Washington Post average of Texas polls since mid-September finds a close race in Texas — just four points separate Trump at 49 percent to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at 45 percent.

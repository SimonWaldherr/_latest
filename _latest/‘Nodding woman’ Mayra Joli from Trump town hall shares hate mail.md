<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more</p><p>Miami lawyer Mayra Joli, the freshly famous &#8220;<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/mystery-nodding-woman-behind-trump-steals-show-at-nbc-town-hall/">nodding woman</a>&#8221; behind President Trump at last week&#8217;s NBC News town hall, says her employees are being targeted with hate mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody can call an employer to fire me,&#8221; <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nodding-lady-trump-town-hall-hate-messages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joli told Fox News</a>. &#8220;What they&#8217;re doing is calling my employees so they quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joli, who donated to Hillary Clinton in 2016, said that &#8220;they start sending other [messages] saying, &#8216;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re working for that person. I thought you were better.&#8217; &#8230; They aren&#8217;t used to this commotion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic-born Joli wore a red mask and nodded in response to Trump&#8217;s answers during a frequently acrimonious hour-long event hosted by Savannah Guthrie of NBC News, who grilled Trump about conspiracy theories and likened him to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/trump-clashes-with-savannah-guthrie-on-qanon-white-supremacists/?preview_id=16463462">&#8220;someone&#8217;s crazy uncle.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Joli&#8217;s nods <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/who-is-mayra-joli-nodding-woman-behind-trump-at-town-hall/">attracted widespread attention</a> on social media, and Trump praised her during a campaign rally Monday in Prescott, Ariz.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about that great woman behind me? She kept going. I love her,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;I met her right after. She&#8217;s great. But I tell you, she was definitely a Trump person. They made a big mistake. The mistake they made was they forgot to check the audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>One letter addressed to her law firm office called her an &#8220;annoying laughing stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joli told Fox News that she converted from Clinton backer to Trump supporter because attacks on him intrigued her.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;The more they trashed him, the more I wanted to find out more about him, and I&#8217;ve been supporting him since. The rest is history,&#8221; Joli said. &#8220;Donald Trump taught me that I cannot just be silent, and I have to think for myself.&#8221;</p>

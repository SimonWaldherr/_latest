City council candidate Heshy Tischler said he “shouldn’t have lost it” during a caught-on-camera incident where he appears to lead a crowd chanting slurs at a reporter who was also assaulted.

“Sometimes I lose it,” Tischler told The Post hours after he was released from Brooklyn Criminal Court on misdemeanor charges for false imprisonment, inciting a riot, menacing and harassment.

“I shouldn’t have lost it. They’re saying I’m some sort of leader. I’m not. I’m just standing up for my community.”

Tischler was arrested Sunday night and arraigned Monday night and released without bail in connection to an attack last Wednesday on journalist Jacob Kornbluh, who was snapping pictures of an Orthodox demonstration in Borough Park.

The protest, which Tischler helped organize, was against restrictions on synagogues, schools and non-essential businesses that Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently imposed in response to an uptick in COVID-19 infections in parts of Brooklyn and Queens.

Tischler allegedly approached Kornbluh with 20 to 30 protesters in tow, calling him a “rat, evil and a pig, pinning [him] against a wall and surrounding [him] on all sides,” according to a criminal complaint.

Video from the scene appears to show as much.

“The defendant was not wearing a mask and was inches away from [Kornbluh’s] face, yelling and screaming at a loud volume, while spittle was emanating from the defendant’s mouth striking [Kornbluh],” the court papers state.

The crowd swelled to 50 to 100 people, and trapped Kornbluh, as Tischler chanted “Moiser” or snitch while others shoved and kicked him, the complaint states. Police had to escort the journalist from the scene. Tischler was not charged with assaulting Kornbluh.

Tischler wouldn’t comment further on the charges against him but he said, “I do not condone violence. My job is to make people’s lives better.”

He said he’s extremely upset about the new restrictions, and said Mayor Bill de Blasio’s numbers on COVID-19 infections are tailored to fit a biased political agenda.

“The mayor has found a way to torture our people, and he is targeting the Jewish communities,” he said. “The numbers have stabilized. No one is dying.”

Cuomo said Monday that COVID-19-related hospitalizations in New York had spiked to a total of 878 and a dozen people died in the state on Sunday alone.

Tischler, who is charged with one count each of unlawful imprisonment, inciting to riot, menacing and harassment, is due back in court on April 27. Before signing off, Tischler invited a reporter to stop by his home for a meal on Shobbos.

“The cooking is not so good by my wife but she’s still a delicious woman,” he said.

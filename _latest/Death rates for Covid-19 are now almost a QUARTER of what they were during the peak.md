  Death rates for Covid-19 are now almost a QUARTER of what they were during the peak 
description: > 
  Death rates for hospitalised Covid-19 patients are now almost a quarter of what they were during the peak of the pandemic, studies have shown.In the UK, similar scientific studies have revealed that death rates in hospitalised coronavirus patients have fallen by at least two-thirds.AdvertisementFindings revealed death rates dropped 'substantially' for all groups by 18 percentage points on average, from 25.6 per cent to 7.6 per cent.He and colleagues recently published a pre-print paper discussing the drop in death rates in 21,000 hospitalised cases in England between March and June.But it was considered a first-port of call for many of the most critically ill Covid-19 patients at the peak because Covid-19 represented itself as a respiratory disease.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">'In the early days we were, almost immediately that people were admitted, putting them in ICU, sedating them and putting them on a ventilator.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We started to use more non-invasive ventilation and patients were doing very well.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ventilation aids breathing. The mechanical type, given to patients who are struggling to breathe on their own, comes with risks.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A tube must be placed down the airways, which is obstructive. There is a growing suspicion the machines actually inflame the airways and lungs of some patients even further.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once a patient is on ventilation, studies have shown there is a low chance of survival, so doctors consider it the last resort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it was considered a first-port of call for many of the most critically ill Covid-19 patients at the peak because Covid-19 represented itself as a respiratory disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">ICNARC reported last month that 84 per cent of Covid-19 patients in ICU were hooked up to ventilators during their hospital stint in the earliest days of the pandemic, compared to 62 per cent in September.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As time has worn on, doctors have been wary of unnecessary ventilation. In a letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine in March, researchers in Germany and Italy said Covid-19 patients need only 'gentle' ventilation.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More patients are now treated using things like CPAP machines &#8212; a face mask with a pump that controls airflow&#160;&#8212; that is also used to treat the disorder sleep apnoea.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The device keeps the airways continuously open in those patients who are able to breathe on their own but it stops their lungs from collapsing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, it's become evident Covid-19 is more than a disease that impacts the lungs. Doctors discovered it causes deadly blood clots and 'cytokine storms', where the body's immune system turns on itself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We saw the effect on blood clotting. We recognise the disease a lot earlier,' Dr Pittard said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Inflammation caused by the 'cytokine storm' can now be treated with a steroid called dexamethasone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cheap drug, which was approved for use in the UK in June, is thought to have contributed to falling death rates across the board considering it cuts the odds of an individual patient dying by a third. However, it is hard to say how much impact the drug has had.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also possible that recruitment to large drug trials, such as the RECOVERY trial, improved outcomes for patients from around April onwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drugs, such as remdesivir, which was the first to be given the go-ahead for use in the NHS in May, have shown to shorten time in ICU and length of illness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Doctors also say that during the peak of the pandemic, hospitals were at capacity and staff were off sick self-isolating, and this may have implicated on the ability to care for patients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When cases surge and hospitals fill up, 'staff are stretched, mistakes are made, it's no one's fault &#8212; it's that the system isn't built to operate near 100 per cent,' Mr Mateen said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His paper suggests the observed drop in mortality may partially be due to 'unsafe' levels of capacity easing as hospital admissions slowed down.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p></div>

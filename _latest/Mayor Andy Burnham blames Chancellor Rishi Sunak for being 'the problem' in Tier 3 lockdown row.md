A growing feud between Andy Burnham and top ministers is set to intensify after the Labour mayor labelled Rishi Sunak 'the problem' in a row over tighter coronavirus restrictions in Greater Manchester.

The mayor of Greater Manchester, who has called for more financial support for the area ahead of plans to plunge it into a Tier 3 lockdown, has hit out at the Chancellor, who he says has made 'wrong judgements throughout this'.

He also attacked Mr Sunak's Eat Out to Help Out scheme as 'poor judgement', in an interview with New Statesman magazine.

It comes after allies close to Chancellor yesterday accused Mr Burnham of using the virus as his 'soapbox moment'.

Mr Burnham and Conservative politicians in Greater Manchester are opposing the government's Tier 3 measures, which will see pubs and bars closed in the area.

The two sides are currently locked in a stalemate over the proposals.

The mayor of Greater Manchester, who has called for more financial support for the area after it was plunged into a Tier Three lockdown, has hit out at the Chancellor, who he says has made 'wrong judgments throughout this'

Rishi Sunak has warned caving into Andy Burnham's demand for more cash will commit Treasury to huge bill Rishi Sunak has warned that caving into Andy Burnham's demand for more cash will commit the Treasury to finding huge sums for other areas facing Covid restrictions. As Downing Street seeks another round of talks with the defiant Manchester Mayor today over introducing Tier 3 rules in the city, the Chancellor is alarmed at the thought of being saddled with another huge bill. Asked about the prospect of handouts for every area placed into Tier 3 status, a Treasury insider asked: 'Who's going to pay for it?' Another source said: 'If you give a pot of money, it creates a precedent. Then everyone who goes into Tier 3 will want a pot of cash.' It is understood, however, that Mr Sunak will not block extra economic measures for the Greater Manchester region if that is 'what it takes to get them over the line' in negotiations with Mr Burnham. The former Labour Minister is expected to use media interviews today to heap pressure on Boris Johnson. As the stand-off grew more rancorous, an ally of Mr Sunak accused Mr Burnham of using the virus as his 'soapbox moment'. Mr Burnham and other local leaders are pressing for more shielding measures for the vulnerable, extra financial aid and stricter local powers to shut down venues that break virus guidelines. A source close to the talks said: 'The leaders are resolute. They say they'll meet Government officials again, but the support package needs to be better and they're not convinced the Tier 3 measures will make any difference.' Mr Johnson says Labour mayors are putting lives at risk by refusing to agree to the measures and is expected to push them into Tier 3 tomorrow even if no agreement is reached. 'They'll go into lockdown on Monday,' one Tory MP said. 'The Government will give them some more money. Boris has to hold on, stay with what he said he would do, and see if it works.' The MP warned that public finances were in a 'spiral vortex downwards', adding: 'It's a large hole in the ground and we keep digging. We have taken leave of our senses.' Advertisement

Mr Burnham has called for a return to the generosity of the original furlough scheme that saw the Treasury pay 80 per cent of workers wages.

But Mr Sunak has only offered a 66 per cent subsidy for those whose firms forced to shut by Tier 3 measures.

Ahead of supposed talks set up for the weekend, which Mr Burnham's office deny, the Greater Manchester mayor hit out at Mr Sunak in an interview with the New Statesman magazine: 'I think the problem now is, to a large degree, the Chancellor. I think he's made wrong judgements throughout this.'

He criticised the Eat Out to Help Out meal subsidy scheme as a 'poor judgment', and added: 'The cost of that should have been paying for the furlough now.'

But he insisted, during the interview, conducted on Friday, that the failure ultimately lies with Boris Johnson as Prime Minister.

He added: 'He shouldn't be allowing the Treasury to run the policy'.

Mr Burnham and council leaders have insisted they 'are ready to meet at any time' in order to broker an agreement with No 10 but there was a failure in communication on Saturday.

Downing Street indicated a call had been scheduled for Sunday morning after a message was left with Mr Burnham.

But a spokesman for the mayor said: 'Nothing has yet been arranged.'

A Downing Street source responded: 'No 10 reached out this morning to try and arrange a meeting with the Mayor of Manchester.

'We will continue to try and reach an agreement on these difficult, yet necessary, measures to protect the NHS and the people of Manchester.'

But Mr Johnson on Friday threatened to impose measures without local support as he warned that 'time is of the essence' and that 'tragically more people will die' with each day of delay.

However, politicians in Manchester have stood firm, calling for more financial support before an agreement is reached.

The Chancellor is alarmed at the thought of being saddled with another huge bill - having shelled out £40billion for the Job Retention Scheme in the national lockdown.

Asked about the prospect of handouts for every area placed into Tier 3 status, a Treasury insider asked: 'Who's going to pay for it?' Another source said: 'If you give a pot of money, it creates a precedent. Then everyone who goes into Tier 3 will want a pot of cash.'

However, It is understood that Mr Sunak will not block extra economic measures for the Greater Manchester region if that is 'what it takes to get them over the line' in negotiations with Mr Burnham.

The row rumbled on as new controls came into force on Saturday, including in Lancashire and London, meant 28 million people, more than half of England, are living under heightened restrictions.

Mr Johnson has been under increased pressure to accept a short national lockdown known as a 'circuit-breaker' to get a grip on the resurgence of Covid-19.

Some 136 deaths were recorded yesterday, but scientists have warned this could rise to 690 by the end of the month

Government adviser Sir John Bell, the regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, told the BB the national measure might be needed, potentially even including a two-week closure of schools in England.

Conservative former health secretary Jeremy Hunt added he had 'sympathy' for the measure, which has been suggested by Labour and the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).

The Prime Minister has been favouring local measures to try to slow the spread of the disease, but on Friday acknowledged he 'can't rule anything out' in taking national action.

Lancashire joined the Liverpool region in entering Tier 3 on Saturday, meaning with pubs and bars closed unless they can serve meals and household mixing banned indoors and in gardens.

Tier 2 measures were also introduced in London, Essex, York, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield.

They prohibit people mixing inside with those from other households, including in pubs and restaurants, renewing calls from businesses for greater financial support.

Mr Johnson divided the country into 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' alert sectors this week after a 9.3 per cent increase in coronavirus cases on the previous week.

The Prime Minister unveiled the new coronavirus three-tier lockdown system on Monday.

Liverpool was immediately put into Tier 3, the highest level, with Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham among cities being ranked as Tier 2, or 'high' risk.

Tier 2, what Tier 2? Drinkers pack bars in London during first night under new rules while revellers also take to the streets of Leeds and Manchester despite curbs being in place

By Nicole Connor and Emer Scully for MailOnline

Drinkers packed into the streets of London, Leeds and Manchester last night despite curbs putting a stop to multiple households sitting inside pubs and restaurants.

In central London drinkers braved the cold to sit outside as the city experienced its first night in Tier Two lockdown.

They filled streets that been deserted during daylight as businesses reported increased cancellations and said revenue across bars and restaurants in central London had plunged by 85 per cent.

London entered Tier 2 at midnight on Friday, banning multiple households from meeting inside pubs and restaurants. That did not deter drinkers, who met outside and sat on tables in the streets despite the cold.

In Manchester and Leeds, where Tier 2 restrictions have been in place since Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled the new rules last week, revellers danced even after the pubs closed for the 10pm curfew.

Around half of Britons are now under some form of enhanced lockdown measures, including 1.5 million in Lancashire which joined the Liverpool region living under the severest controls on Saturday. Manchester is verging upon being forced into the same measures.

Despite the evening scenes, hospitality bosses warned earlier in the day that central London revenues had fallen 85 per cent during the first day of new restrictions, while bosses warned that 200,000 jobs could be lost this weekend alone.

LEEDS: Two women spent their Saturday out in Leeds despite coronavirus cases rising rapidly in the UK's cities. The region is under threat of Tier 3 restrictions

Kate Nicholls, Chief Executive of UKHospitality, said the industry's worst fears were confirmed as cancellations soared and revenues slumped dramatically.

Ms Nicholls said that revenue across bars and restaurants in central London plunged by 85 per cent as less people took to venues under new restrictions.

She said: 'The first day of Tier 2 restrictions saw the hospitality sector's worst fears confirmed with a 50% increase in cancellations and a fall in forward bookings.

'Venues across the capital saw significantly reduced footfall meaning revenues slumped by 85% in central London.'

Ms Nicholls added: 'That is clearly unsustainable and businesses in London are now planning to close their doors and shutter their sites, with forecasts of up to 200,000 job losses unless enhanced JSS is extended.'

Ms Nicholls has pushed for the 'job support scheme', which requires employers to cough up 55 per cent of staff wages, to waive employer contributions and called for a tier-3 style funding for all hospitality in which venues hit by closures can get £3,000 grants.

Under the new guidelines individuals from different households in London, Essex, York and parts of Derbyshire, will be banned from mixing indoors, even in hospitality venues.

Outdoor socially distanced mingling is permitted for groups of up to six, meaning people from different households will be required to meet in beer gardens or at restaurants with outdoor seating.

One publican from Essex told MailOnline: 'There was a huge change today with Tier 2 restrictions. We went from being completely full last night, to multiple cancellations today.'

They said the pub, which has not been named to protect the bar worker's identity, was so quiet it was 'depressing and demoralising', adding: 'The pub was the quietest I’ve seen it the fact it was a Saturday makes it even more depressing and demoralising.

'The takeaway/ collection service was busy but that is dealt with by the kitchen staff and one other person whose sole focus is deliverys and collections.

'We have a takeaway/collection service which was set up during lockdown and we have kept running since reopening. Tonight was the busiest it had been since the lifting of lockdown by all accounts hopefully this will continue. From speaking to customers they were sad to see it so quiet, the main feelings was that hopefully people will realise that they need to support their local businesses.

'I was on an afternoon/evening shift tonight, when I arrived for the start of my shift there was a few tables indoors occupied and the same outside. (We have copious outdoor seating space), multiple cancellations and what would usually be a very busy full on evening even in these strange times was the complete opposite.'

Ms Nicholls said: 'Being moved into tier 2 is a curse for businesses. They will be trapped in a no man's land of being open, but with severe restrictions that will significantly hit custom, all while unable to access the job support available in tier 3. It is the worst of both worlds for businesses.

'Venues in London have already taken a hit due to the dip in inbound tourism and with people increasingly working from home.

'A move into tier 2 will now be catastrophic for some of them and it is only going to be made worse by the end of the furlough scheme in under two weeks.'

Soho, famous for its thriving nightlife, was pedestrianised when the national lockdown started to lift at the start of summer so its eateries and bars could set tables up in the street.

Some said they had seen a slight drop in customer numbers compared to last weekend, but said it could be down to the falling temperatures rather than the latest measures.

One member of staff, who asked not to be named, at the at the Greyhounds Pub on Greek Street said he now had to ask everyone sitting inside if they came from the same household.

'I ask them but it's just not practical, I have no way of checking unless I ask everyone to give me their address,' he said.

A waiter at L'Antica Pizzeria Da Michele on Old Compton Street said they could no longer take bookings as a result of the changes, and relied on walk-ins.

Despite that, Marcelo Teixeira Moraes, 24, said the restaurant had been at its 'busiest for months' on Friday.

'People were grabbing the chance to go out all together while they could, it was so busy I couldn't keep up,' he said.

Door staff at Comptons, a nearby pub, said they were also having to rely on people's honesty when it came to making sure customers sitting inside were all from the same household.

One member of staff said they had been very lucky so far in terms of customer numbers, but were worried about what would happen when the weather turned colder.

Earlier in the day, anti-lockdown protesters marched down Oxford Street before congregating in nearby Leicester Square to demonstrate against the restrictions.

Led by Piers Corbyn, brother of former Labour leader Jeremy, protesters yelled at passers by to remove their masks, and telling them any Covid-19 vaccine would be 'poison'.

Almost a third of restaurants and pubs in England will be affected by the tougher tier curbs introduced - more than 8,500 venues and 5,000 pubs

Busy bars and restaurants in the capital had already seen restrictions like the 10pm curfew before Tier 2 was introduced

Many of those on the march headed to Soho's pubs at the end of the demo.

On Friday revellers made the most of their final night out over the weekend and descended onto London's streets to enjoy bars and restaurants before the restrictions came in at midnight.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman revealed one person was arrested 'for being drunk and disorderly' as pubs closed in Soho at 10pm.

They said: 'Police were deployed in town centres across London on the night of Friday, October 16, including in Soho to reassure the public and ensure compliance with the COVID regulations.

Wetherspoon boss blasts 10pm curfew after chain suffers £105million loss By Mark Duell for MailOnline Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin today renewed his attack on the Government after the pub chain suffered a £105million loss following a 30 per cent drop in sales. Mr Martin said it was unfair that pubs have been treated harsher than supermarkets as he revealed sales fell from £1.82billion to £1.26billion in the year to July 26, 2020. Publishing the company's delayed results, he added that the UK should adopt the Swedish model for pandemics to allow his pubs to open again properly, a system which he said 'emphasises social distancing, hygiene and trust in the people'. The company also announced a further 108 job cuts at its head office, having already said it would cut up to 130 jobs at its HQ and up to 450 at airport concessions. Mr Martin, quoting businessman Warren Buffett from 1989, said governments across the world have based their lockdown decisions on 'deeply flawed analysis'. He claimed Swedish Professor Johan Giesecke is the epidemiologist equivalent and the UK should follow his lead, which would allow Wetherspoon to reopen pubs. Advertisement

'A gathering did form in Soho and officers sought to disperse the crowd in accordance with the regulations. One person was arrested for being drunk and disorderly. One other person was issued a dispersal order and directed away from the area. The crowd was dispersed by 22.25pm.'

Almost a third of restaurants and pubs in England will be affected by the tougher tier curbs introduced - more than 8,500 venues and 5,000 pubs.

Pubs which serve very little food are expected to have suffered the most through the pandemic so far, due to not having benefitted from the 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme which saw a cut on food VAT.

Industry bosses previously estimated 300,000 hospitality jobs would be lost in the absence of an industry bailout by government.

But Ms Nicholls prediction of 200,000 jobs to be lost in central London this weekend alone means the total could be much higher.

This comes as Britain recorded its highest number of coronavirus deaths in four months after another 150 victims were announced today.

Department of Health statistics show the grim milestone hasn't been reached since June 10 when 164 lab-confirmed coronavirus deaths were announced.

It is also a surge of 85 per cent compared to last Saturday, when 81 deaths were registered, and a rise of 16 from yesterday's toll of 136 victims.

Health chiefs today posted another 16,171 cases, up only six per cent on the figure recorded last Saturday (15,166), in a sign that the UK's coronavirus outbreak may be beginning to slow.

As many as 15,650 more positive tests were added to the tally yesterday.

Although still rising, the number of deaths from the virus remains miles off the levels seen at the height of the pandemic when more than 1,000 were being registered every day at the beginning of April.

Boris Johnson divided the country into 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' alert sectors this week after after a 9.3 per cent increase in coronavirus cases on the previous week.

The Prime Minister unveiled the new coronavirus three-tier lockdown system on Monday.

Liverpool was immediately put into Tier 3, the highest level, with Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham among cities being ranked as Tier 2, or 'high' risk.

Coronavirus positive tests in London have increased dramatically since the beginning of September but changes in recent weeks suggest the rate of rise is slowing down, with a 37 per cent increase in the seven days to October 7, compared to the almost double 84 per cent in the third week of September

Some 136 deaths were recorded yesterday, but scientists have warned this could rise to 690 by the end of the month

Tier 1 restrictions, which the majority of England has been placed under, are believed to mirror the rules currently in place across the country.

It includes the rule of six, a 10pm curfew, group sport to be played outdoors only and a maximum of 15 guests at wedding ceremonies.

Under Tier 2 restrictions, households are also banned from meeting indoors, even in hospitality venues.

Two households are allowed to socialise outdoors but must stay within the six-person limit and adhere to social distancing.

The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police today vowed to police 'without fear or favour' amid a political row between Downing Street and local leaders

Under these regulations, residents are not banned from travelling to a Tier 1 area, but are advised to minimise the number of journeys they make.

Draconian Tier 3 regulations have seen restaurants close at 10pm, pubs and bars being ordered to close and households have been banned from mixing indoors or outdoors.

Locals are advised to only leave their areas for essential travel, including work and education, and overnight stays outside of 'high' risk areas are banned.

It comes as the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police vowed to police 'without fear or favour' amid a political row between Downing Street and local leaders over tougher coronavirus measures.

In an open letter, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said that while he is 'accountable' to Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, he is 'operationally independent'.

It follows reports that the Government has not imposed Tier 3 measures on the region over fears police would not enforce them without the backing of Mr Burnham.

Political leaders in the region have so far refused to accept the highest level of restrictions without greater financial support for businesses and residents.

Mr Hopkins wrote: 'All officers and staff in Greater Manchester Police are accountable to me as Chief Constable. We carry out operational policing without fear or favour and in line with the Police Services code of ethics alongside colleagues across the country.'

He added: 'It is for local and national politicians to agree the necessary restrictions to keep us all safe.

'As the Chief Constable I will then ensure my officers and staff enforce these in a proportionate manner alongside our local authority partners.'

Mr Hopkins said he has spoken to both the mayor and Home Secretary Priti Patel throughout the pandemic. 'We are all agreed that there needs to be a proportionate level of enforcement to existing regulations,' he said, adding he had 'support' from both in relation to the force's approach.

The Prime Minister tried to increase pressure on Mr Burnham during a Downing Street press conference yesterday, threatening to impose the measures if local leaders did not accept them.

Blackpool's Big One rollercoaster (pictured today) has remained open despite the the introduction of Tier 3 coronavirus restrictions for Lancashire today

October is traditionally one of the busiest periods for the seaside town as crowds flock to see the Blackpool Illuminations during the school half-term holidays, but B&B owners said the new restrictions are a 'kick in the teeth', as guests cancel bookings following the new restrictions

Meanwhile, traffic is still flowing freely across the border from England to Wales on the first day of the supposed travel ban from high-Covid areas.

The ban, which came into force at 6pm on Friday, makes it an offence to travel to Wales from coronavirus hotspots in the UK.

It was described as 'unenforceable' by the Police Federation earlier this week and there is still no sign of any high-visibility patrols or roadblocks to deter travel from Merseyside - despite Liverpool being in Tier 3.

Those who ignore the restrictions will be breaking the law and could face fixed penalty notices starting at £50 - but there have so far been no reports of drivers being stopped.

And Blackpool's Big One rollercoaster, casinos and theme parks have remained open despite the the introduction of Tier Three coronavirus restrictions for Lancashire on Saturday, with guests continuing to pack the town's streets.

Guests were pictured riding the rollercoaster while wearing face masks, as others continued to enjoy the seaside town's Blackpool Pleasure Beach despite Lancashire joining Liverpool as the only area in England in the top tier of coronavirus restrictions.

While some gyms were forced to shut in Liverpool today and the streets of London appeared deserted under new Tier Two regulations, Blackpool was heaving with people enjoying the town's attractions.

Tier Three restrictions for the 'very high risk' category area include harsher restrictions on socialising, with people told not to mix with others in any indoor setting or private garden, as well as in most outdoor hospitality venues.

Despite the packed streets, B&B owners have said the new restrictions are a 'kick in the teeth', with guests cancelling bookings following the new restrictions.

They fear the new Covid-19 measures will drive tourists away, despite some of the attractions remaining open.

Kamala Harris, 55, is a Democratic senator from California who serves on the Senate Judiciary, Intelligence, Security and Governmental Affairs, and Budget Committees.

Prior to joining the Senate, she served as the District Attorney of San Francisco and the Attorney General of California between 2004 and 2017.

During her time at the Senate, Harris has won praise for her famously fiery line of questioning during hearings. Prominent figures like Attorney General Bill Barr and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg have found themselves at the other end of her prosecutorial questions.

Harris launched her own bid for President in 2019 before ending her campaign in December due to a lack of sufficient funding.

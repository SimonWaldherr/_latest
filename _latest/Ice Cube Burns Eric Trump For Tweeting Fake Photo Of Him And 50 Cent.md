<p>The photo wasn&#8217;t legit, as BuzzFeed media editor Craig Silverman pointed out.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The other day it was a false claim about Biden owning a home he sold many years ago. Today, Eric Trump shares an obviously photoshopped pic of two rappers in Trump hats.

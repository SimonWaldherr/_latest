  Merseyside derby video referee didn't know he could give Jordan Pickford a red card 
description: > 
  The VAR in charge of Saturday's controversial Merseyside derby did not check for a red card for Jordan Pickford after forgetting rules state he could review the incident despite the offside in the build-up.Liverpool are livid after Pickford's potential season-ending challenge on Virgil van Dijk went unpunished with David Coote, the official overseeing proceedings at Stockley Park, failing to look at whether Everton's goalkeeper should be dismissed.Remarkably, Sportsmail has been told Coote thought the offside — which he checked forensically — nullified what happened afterwards.Liverpool insiders say they were told on Saturday that Coote was 'too distracted' by the offside check and therefore did not look at the possible red card for Pickford.The current set-up operates at 50 frames per second, meaning a picture is taken every 0.02 seconds.

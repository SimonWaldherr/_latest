  Trump trails Biden in swing state and national polls. But here's how he can still win. 
description: > 
  Additionally, Maine and Nebraska split their electoral votes by congressional districts and are both in play.Trump’s upset victory over Clinton effectively netted him 306 electoral votes, well above the 270 needed to win a majority.Still, while the Biden campaign is devoting considerable resources to these states, there’s no assurance any will actually flip his way.Most alarmingly for the Biden campaign, Trump still has room to grow his support in the state.So, two weeks out from Nov. 3, there’s good reason for Biden campaign officials to be cautious.

<div><p class="endmarkEnabled">Joe Biden&#8217;s campaign manager, Jen O&#8217;Malley Dillon, recently warned supporters that despite their side&#8217;s strong poll numbers in national surveys, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.npr.org/2020/10/15/923946468/poll-biden-takes-double-digit-lead-over-trump__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!4np0oH4K_RF9ksHNL0Al59AoYHrnPvv16eVfk5rhJ8q065bOMwZ7di8oeDTE7z5SBJA%24">defeating President Donald Trump</a> shouldn&#8217;t be taken for granted. &#8220;There is still a long way to go in this campaign,&#8221; <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://twitter.com/jomalleydillon/status/1316550240216977409__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!4np0oH4K_RF9ksHNL0Al59AoYHrnPvv16eVfk5rhJ8q065bOMwZ7di8oeDTEcPrxo8E%24">O&#8217;Malley Dillon said on Twitter</a> on Oct. 14. And &#8220;we think this race is far closer than folks on this website (Twitter) think.

Trump&#8217;s approval rating, meanwhile, is 44.8 percent, with a 53.8 percent disapproval rating, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html">average shows</a>. Biden is widely seen as a conciliatory veteran lawmaker and an empathetic figure who would restore normality to the White House after the tumult of the Trump years.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">The former VP leads in the national vote by nearly 10 points, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/presidential-polls">according to the latest polls</a>, and also in nearly all the swing states most likely to decide the election, which include several states Trump won in 2016, among them Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Though this landscape appears to favor Biden, several factors still offer Trump&#8217;s campaign hope. The Electoral College map can be divvied up among the candidates enough different ways to leave the president some late-in-the-game paths to victory. Additionally, polls may not be counting broad swaths of people who were eligible to vote but didn&#8217;t in 2016 but still could this time; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/voter-registration-republicans-swing-states-narrow-gap/">GOP voter registration is up</a> in several key states, including Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, so some of these voters can now head to the polls.</p><p></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">A myriad of court cases challenging who is eligible to vote could also work to Trump&#8217;s electoral benefit. Not to mention ongoing efforts at interference in the elections from Russian and other outside parties that could affect the race in unpredictable ways. Plus the ultimately unpredictable &#8220;October Surprise,&#8221; a last-minute election-shaping event, such as one related to the financial dealings of Joe Biden&#8217;s son Hunter or an as-yet-unidentified source of disruption.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Going into 2020 the partisan breakdown among the states &#8212; whose delegates determine how many of the Electoral College&#8217;s 538 votes each candidate gets &#8212; finds <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/road-to-270-2020/">21 red states</a> (totally 163 electoral votes) and 17 are blue states, plus the heavily-Democratic District of Columbia (for 212 electoral votes), virtually unshakable in their voting patterns. This leaves 12 swing states, with their combined 161 electoral votes, as the deciders: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Additionally, Maine and Nebraska split their electoral votes by congressional districts and are both in play. Polling shows that Biden has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/upshot/poll-omaha-nebraska-election.html">decent shot at winning</a> Nebraska&#8217;s Second District, based in Omaha, while <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2020/10/06/politics/jared-golden-surges-in-maines-2nd-district-in-bdn-poll-as-trump-performs-well-there/">Trump is ahead</a> in Maine&#8217;s Second District, in the state&#8217;s northern tier.</p><p id="embed-20201019-clinton-trump-map"></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">All of which means that Trump can win the Electoral College if he takes Pennsylvania and holds much &#8212; though not absolutely all &#8212; of the states he won in 2016. Trump&#8217;s upset victory over Clinton <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/president__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!4np0oH4K_RF9ksHNL0Al59AoYHrnPvv16eVfk5rhJ8q065bOMwZ7di8oeDTEzDuKUFI%24">effectively netted him 306 electoral votes</a>, well above the 270 needed to win a majority.

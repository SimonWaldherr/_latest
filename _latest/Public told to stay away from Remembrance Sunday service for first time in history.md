The public have been banned from this year's Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph for the first time in history, with the Culture Secretary asking people to remember the fallen at home.

Oliver Dowden said he was announcing the restriction on the 11am service with a "heavy heart" but stressed that it was needed to keep veterans safe.

A limited number of people, including Armed Forces veterans, members of the Royal family and international leaders, will be permitted to attend, and the service will be made "Covid-secure" by ensuring that strict social distancing measures are in place. The march past the memorial will not take place.

Mr Dowden said: "This Remembrance Sunday has a particular significance as it marks 100 years since the Cenotaph was installed. Whilst we will mark this occasion properly, it is with a heavy heart that I must ask people not to attend the ceremony at the Cenotaph this year in order to keep veterans and the public safe.

"We will ensure our plans for the day are a fitting tribute to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice and that our veterans are at the heart of the service, with the nation able to watch safely from home."

It comes as London prepares to move into Tier 2 Covid restrictions, banning the mixing of households indoors and in restaurants and bars.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Recent campaign filings show how much more the Trump campaign&#8217;s joint operation with the Republican Party is spending to raise its money than Mr. Biden. The two joint Trump committees with the R.N.C. spent $190.8 million in July, August and September to raise $355.2 million.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Biden campaign spent less than half as much on fund-raising from its two joint operations with the Democratic Party ($82.4 million) and yet raised far more, $457 million, during that same period.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Some money from these joint funds is eligible to be transferred back to the candidates&#8217;s main campaign committees, but byzantine accounting rules prevent a full accounting of what can be shifted. Mr. Biden had far more money in the accounts that could transfer such funds than Mr. Trump. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Yikes,&#8221; Rufus Gifford, one of Mr. Biden&#8217;s deputy campaign managers who oversees fund-raising, wrote <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/rufusgifford/status/1318694924364238849" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> when Mr. Trump&#8217;s amount of cash on hand became public.

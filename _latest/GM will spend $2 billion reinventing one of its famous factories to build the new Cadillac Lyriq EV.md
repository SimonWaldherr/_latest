</p><p>In a news presentation, United Auto Workers Vice President Terry Dittes said that the XT5 and XT6 would remain in production at Spring Hill, which employs roughly 3,500 workers. The Acadia, he added, would be relocated to GM's Lansing, Michigan, plant, itself benefiting from a $100 million investment.</p>

<p>Last week, GM said it would spend $2.2 billion to transform its Detroit-Hamtramck factory to be an all-EV facility. The plant was renamed "Factory Zero" in a nod to GM CEO Mary Barra's strategy for a zero-emission future for the largest US automaker by sales volume.</p><p>

There are many adages counselling when exactly is the right time to reach into one’s hosiery drawer and declare tights season to be open again. Some say you should only wear tights if there is an “R” in the month, or reserve them for temperatures sub-14 degrees. In normal circumstances, at around this point in October, the switch would be unanimous for all from the city commute to the school run; it’s officially too cold for bare legs.

But in this most extraordinary of years, how will sightings (and sales) of tights fare? With most still advised to work from home where possible, and without much of a party season on the cards, might tights be the latest sartorial casualty of the pandemic?

Not so, say the retailers, who have still bought hosiery in hauls. In fact, the prediction is that sales will be just as strong as in any recent year, and that we might even embrace a greater variety of designs than ever before.

The business of classic black tights is well established with two key players: Heist and Marks & Spencer. The former is the new authority on British tights, and now delivers an eco-friendly version of its perfect light tint in a 35 denier (£24), or 60 denier opaque (£26, both heist-studios.com). The latter is the true authority – M&S has sold tights since the Sixties and is still the UK market leader, selling 5.4 million pairs per year. Black tights will soon get a starring role on our winter lockdown TV agenda, too – Nicole Kidman’s Manhattan chiller thriller The Undoing starts on Sky on October 26, and delivers excellent coat, boots and smoky tights combos throughout.

But it is this fun caveat – that this year we might all stray from the standard issue styles – which is most interesting. The problem with thick, colourful, knitted tights, historically, has been that they look bonkers with most shoes. This year, when padding around the house, I’ve barely worn shoes. Problem solved. Tights may finally move on from being dubbed “solutionwear”, to becoming the main fashion event.

“The rise in working from home has made us reflect on what is important in our wardrobes,” considers Soozie Jenkinson, head of lingerie design at M&S, noting that searches for tights have increased on the retailer’s website by over 30 per cent in the last week. “As temperatures drop, we will look to warmer layers to keep us cosy. Loungewear and cosy, comfy styles have become our go-to work-from-home favourites and those principles apply to legwear too.”

High-flying financier Amanda Staveley has more than halved her claim for damages against Barclays as her High Court battle with the British bank enters its final week.

The 47-year-old sued Barclays for £1.6billion on claims she was edged out of a lucrative deal at the height of the financial crisis.

But Barclays' lawyers, which returned to court on Monday to begin making final legal submissions, told the judge overseeing the fight that Staveley's firm PCP is now making a 'maximum claim' for £771million.

High Court battle: Staveley's firm PCP is now making a 'maximum claim' for £771million

Jeffery Onions QC, who leads Barclays' legal team, told the judge in a written submission: 'When the trial started, the quantum of the claim, as widely reported in the press, was for £1.6billion.

'No attempt was made to justify that claim. It was not until a letter dated 19 August 2020, after the evidence was concluded, that PCP acknowledged that the maximum claim for which it was now contending was less than half that amount (£771 million).'

Barclays say PCP's claim should be dismissed.

Barclays turned to investors in Qatar and Abu Dhabi in 2008 to raise more than £7billion and maintain its independence from the UK government and state ownership.

Staveley, who was representing Abu Dhabi, claimed Barclays offered her firm PCP the 'same deal' as other investors only to instead funnel an extra £346million in secret fees to Qatar.

She also claimed that a £2billion loan from Barclays to Qatari investors was 'concealed' from the market, shareholders and her private equity firm.

And Staveley made complaints about the behaviour of Barclays' bosses when negotiating investment deals during the 2008 financial crisis.

Barclays dealmaker Roger Jenkins called Staveley a 'dolly bird' and a 'tart' in phone calls as he fought for a £7billion investment in autumn 2008 during the financial crash. He apologised for that in July.

Another banker, Stephen Jones, resigned as boss of lobby group UK Finance in June over 'deeply unpleasant and personal' comments made about Staveley in 2008.

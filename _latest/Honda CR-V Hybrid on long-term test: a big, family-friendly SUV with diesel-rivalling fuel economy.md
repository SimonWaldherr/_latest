Families place a high demand on their transport, needing the fun as well as the functional. Now that diesel is out of favour, how does a hybrid stack up?

Our car: Honda CR-V 2.0i-MMD Hybrid EX

I’d fallen into the trap. I started a family, and I rushed out and got myself a massive SUV. I’d always promised myself I wouldn’t – after all, does one very small addition to the clan really mean you need a vast off-road appliance to clump around in? And yet, here I was, standing on the driveway, strapping my three-month-old daughter into a Honda CR-V. Sigh.

In my defence, there were good reasons for the CR-V’s presence on the Telegraph Cars fleet, and not all of them involve a sudden urge to protect a tiny human being by surrounding them with the biggest metal cage you can find.

I’d just given back our Passat GTE – a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) – and having been able to charge it regularly, I’d found it pretty useful. But I’d also become painfully aware of how much less useful it would have been had I not had a place to plug it in. Could I achieve the same sort of fuel efficiency from a regular hybrid?

And is it really true, as so many car buyers seem to believe these days, that an SUV does a better job as a family car than a conventional estate?

Which Honda CR-V to buy

The CR-V, in this form at least, joined the fleet for three months to answer both of those questions. It’s one of only two large SUVs to be available with a traditional hybrid powertrain – i.e. one you don’t have to plug in. You can also get it with a 1.5-litre petrol turbo instead, which is cheaper to buy, but uses more fuel as a trade-off.

He can say that again. The Yankees sure did hit a lot of home runs the past couple of weeks. Stanton hit them and Judge hit three, even if he didn’t do much else, and Luke Voit kept hitting them. But you saw what happened when they stopped. They struck out 18 times as a team in Game 2. They struck out 12 more times on Friday night. They got one run in Game 5. They got a total of one run against the Astros in Games 6 and 7 three years ago. It’s big fun to watch all the big flies. The Yankees won 100 games twice, in 2018 and ’19, hitting so many balls out of sight you lost count. They’re still one of the best teams in baseball. Just not the best, and not for a long time.

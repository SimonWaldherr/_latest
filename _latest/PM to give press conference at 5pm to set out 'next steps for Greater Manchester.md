 <p>     </p> <p>Last night Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick wrote to local leaders in the region giving them until midday today to reach a deal - or have Tier 3 imposed upon them.</p> <p>It comes as a Downing Street spokesman said that talks with council chiefs in the North East, North West and parts of Yorkshire ere ongoing.</p> <p>But there is no expected announcement on if they will be put into the highest level of restrictions today.</p> <p>The figures suggesting that the R rate in the North East "has begun to fall slightly" may change talks, a spokesman for the PM suggested.</p> <p>Downing Street also tried to downplay reports that the UK could be headed for a last-minute circuit breaker lockdown before half term.</p> <p>Last night the Telegraph reported that a so-called 'gold meeting' on Wednesday would be held to recommend circuit break for England to start on Friday, in line with Wales and in time for half-term holidays.</p> <p>But a spokesman for the PM said: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure where that one&#8217;s come from. Gold meetings take place on a weekly basis but that&#8217;s to look at the latest data on local infection rates.</p> <p>"And I think you&#8217;ve heard me and the Prime Minister say on a number of occasions that we believe the localised tier approach is the right one. Of course, we keep all measures under review.&#8221;</p> <p>Asked directly about&#160; planning for circuit break, he said: &#8220;Our planning is on having discussions with local leaders [on] level 3 measures."</p> <p>He said: "The deteriorating public health situation in Greater Manchester means that we need to take action urgently."</p> <p>Last night, Mr Jenrick claimed the Government had held discussions "in good faith" for 10 days with local leaders - despite turning down pleas for more financial support&#160;for jobs and businesses.</p> <p>But a letter, seen by the Mirror, shows the government was offering the region just &#163;22m of confirmed funds - &#163;8 per head - and still only "looking at" additional funding to help businesses.</p> <p>Mr Burnham branded the letter "provocative", saying the "late-night ultimatum" was "a bit odd" when the government hadn't yet concluded talks over funds.</p> <p>The metro mayor told Sky News businesses are &#8220;on the brink&#8221; and &#8220;close to collapse&#8221; while the government is "trying to penny pinch on Tier 3".</p>

 <p>     </p> <p>Mr Burnham said he would be meeting Greater Manchester leaders this morning "quite early" and would write to the government before noon setting out a "fair figure".</p> <p>He refused to say what the figure would be, but said it must reflect the fact Greater Manchester has effectively been under Tier 2 restrictions for three months.</p> <p>&#8220;Health is about more than simply controlling the virus," he said, and if the government doesn't step in we&#8217;ll see a &#8220;mental health crisis on top of a pandemic&#8221;.</p> <p>He added: "I will make no apology at all for sticking up for people whose lives will be harmed by this. I don&#8217;t think they are getting sufficient support at the moment.&#8221;</p> <p>But Mr Burnham said if Tier 3 was imposed against his will, "we won't break the law".</p> <p>Merseyside received &#163;44m while Lancs got &#163;42m in their Tier 3 deals with Government - they both have populations of 1.5m. It suggests that Greater Manchester could qualify for a total support package of around &#163;75m.</p>

   <p>Andy Burnham yesterday said he still hoped to reach agreement with the Government.</p> <p>He also complained the Government had today sought to raise public concern about the NHS in Greater Manchester with the release of "selective statistics" about the occupancy rates in intensive care.</p> <p>A statement from Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester and Sir Richard Leese, Leader of Manchester City Council and Greater Manchester Health Lead said: &#8220;We went into today&#8217;s meeting with the Government with a positive and unanimous view amongst Greater Manchester Leaders that we should seek a resolution as soon as possible.</p> <p>&#8220;We had been encouraged by earlier discussions at an official level where the idea of a Hardship Fund, to top up furlough payments and support the self-employed, had been tabled by the Government.</p> <p>"It was both surprising and disappointing when this idea was taken off the table by the Secretary of State.</p> <p>&#8220;We are appreciative of discussions resuming later this afternoon at officials level and very much hope this will lead to a positive outcome."</p>

<p>They said being in Tier-2 style restrictions for almost three months had taken a toll on people and businesses.</p> <p>The statement added: "With this in mind, we do not believe it is in any way unreasonable for us to require better protection for our lowest-paid residents.</p> <p>&#8220;Finally, we are disappointed that the Government has today sought to raise public concern about the NHS in Greater Manchester with selective statistics.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>&#8220;Greater Manchester&#8217;s ICU occupancy rate is not abnormal for this time of year and is comparable to the occupancy rate in October 2019.</p> <p>"Also, providing information about individual hospitals does not reflect that our hospitals work as a system to manage demand.</p> <p>&#8220;We are not complacent about the position in our hospitals and are monitoring the situation closely.</p> <p>"But in the current situation, we believe it is essential that our residents are given clear, accurate information about the state of the NHS in Greater Manchester and that public fears are not raised unnecessarily.&#8221;</p> <p>Local leaders in Greater Manchester were furious after receiving the Jenrick letter almost an hour after it was briefed to the press.</p> <p>A second Greater Manchester politician said: "They're completely contemptuous of us with their spin, threats and demands when all we want are workable measures and proper protections for our businesses and residents after three months of failed local lockdowns".</p></div>

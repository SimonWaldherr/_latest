Several types of fresh cut fruit sold at Walmart stores in nine states are being recalled for possible listeria contamination.

In a recall notice posted on the Food and Drug Administration website Saturday, Country Fresh said expanded its voluntary recall issued the day before to include various containers of Freshness Guaranteed-brand cut or sliced apples, grapes, mangos, pineapples and cantaloupe distributed by Walmart.

"The recall is a precautionary measure due to a possible health risk from Listeria monocytogenes detected on equipment used in an area near where these products are packed," Country Fresh said in the recall notice. "FDA discovered these findings during a recent inspection."

The “best if used by” dates between Oct. 3 and 11, the notice says, noting there have been no reported illnesses from the products to date.

According to the notice, Walmart stores removed the recalled product from store shelves and inventories immediately and consumers who "have any recalled product on the list should not consume it and discard it immediately."

The fruit was shipped to Walmart retail distribution centers and sent to select stores in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Lousiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. See the full list of recalled items and UPC numbers on the recall notice.

The initial Country Fresh voluntary recall was for cut watermelon shipped directly to Walmart and RaceTrac’s retail distribution centers stores in select stores located in Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas.

The items, which include a melon trio at RaceTrac, had "best-if-used by" dates of Oct. 2, 3 and 4.

Consumers with questions about the recalls can call Country Fresh at 1-877-251-8300 weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST.

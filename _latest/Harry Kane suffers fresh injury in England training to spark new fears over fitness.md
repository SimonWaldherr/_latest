Harry Kane has given England a major injury scare ahead of Sunday's Wembley clash with Belgium.

The Tottenham striker is doubtful for the Nations League meeting with the world's top-ranked team after complaining of muscle tightness at the end of Saturday's training session.

It is understood that the England skipper has remained with Gareth Southgate's squad - despite a request from Spurs to return to the club for treatment.

Kane, 27, suffered a serious hamstring tear in January that would have put his participation at Euro 2020 in doubt had the coronavirus crisis not forced UEFA to postpone the tournament for 12 months.

But Southgate wanted his No 1 striker to lead his attack against the high-flying Belgians and in Wednesday night's clash against Denmark.

Kane has scored 32 goals in just 47 games for his country.

Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin marked his debut with a goal against the Welsh and is expected to replace Kane if he fails to make it.

Southgate was full of praise for the former Sheffield United man after he took his excellent Premier League form onto the international stage on Thursday.

"[He was] really good, he had excellent presence, his runs are a threat, he presses well and he took his goal well," the Three Lions boss told ITV

"I thought he could be really pleased. I think he is in a really good vein of form. He's an all-round centre forward.

"I've always liked his general play but it's the goals that are making him another level of player."

<div><p>NASA scientists will announce an &#8220;exciting new discovery&#8221; about the moon in a virtual press conference on Monday, the agency said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The news will be announced by NASA in a 12 p.m. teleconference that will also stream on the its website, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-announce-new-science-results-about-moon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement said</a>.</p>
<p>Further details about what the announcement will include were not released &#8212; but NASA teased that the discovery will contribute to &#8220;efforts to learn about the moon in support of deep space exploration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding the science of the moon also helps piece together the broader history of the inner solar system,&#8221; NASA added.</p>
<p>The agency <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/22/first-woman-to-land-on-the-moon-in-2024-nasa-confirms/">intends to send</a> the first woman and another man to the lunar surface in 2024, a landing it says will prepare it for a Mars exploration by the 2030s.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, NASA said it had awarded a number of US companies $370 million in contracts to help ensure the space exploration plans move forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;NASA&#8217;s significant investment in innovative technology demonstrations, led by small and large US businesses across nine states, will expand what is possible in space and on the lunar surface,&#8221; NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/nasa-awards-14-us-companies-with-370m-to-transform-space/">said in a statement</a> when the contracts were announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, NASA and industry are building up an array of mission-ready capabilities to support a sustainable presence on the moon and future human missions to Mars,&#8221; he added.</p>

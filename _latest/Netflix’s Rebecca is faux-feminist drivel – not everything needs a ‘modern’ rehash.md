  Netflix’s Rebecca is faux-feminist drivel – not everything needs a ‘modern’ rehash 
description: > 
  I could even see a case for arguing that Pride and Prejudice, which let’s face it, doesn’t pass the Bechdel Test, is feminist.To upholster these classics for modern audiences and our modern values therefore adds an edge that is at once interesting, relevant and compelling.But there are also plenty of books and films that aren’t feminist and really shouldn’t be, no matter how woke the remake.It’s a cruel story which treats Tess as a punching bag, and there’s absolutely no way to retell it in a feminist light.If you wanted to do so, you’d have to completely rewrite the story to make it Tess of the Respectable Single Parenthood.

<div><p>Aside from killing the power dynamic and resultant sexual tension which exists in the book, the real problem with this punchier, more feminist second Mrs de Winter is that it has the same effect you get when you put fresh paint on the walls and it makes the carpet looks shabbier by contrast.</p>
<p>If you watch the director of any recent period drama being interviewed, the chances are that someone will look down the camera, take a pause and then say: &#8220;When you really think about it, this is a truly&#160;feminist&#160;story&#8221; &#8211; and then they&#8217;ll go on to describe how they wanted to &#8220;bring that out&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>And in some cases, it&#8217;s true. Vanity Fair is a feminist story. Jane Eyre is a feminist story. I could even see a case for arguing that Pride and Prejudice, which let&#8217;s face it, doesn&#8217;t pass the Bechdel Test, is feminist. To upholster these classics for modern audiences and our modern values therefore adds an edge that is at once interesting, relevant and compelling.</p>
<p>But there are also plenty of books and films that&#160;aren&#8217;t feminist and really shouldn&#8217;t be, no matter how woke the remake. Tess of the D&#8217;Urbervilles, for instance,&#160;is a story of woman who is punished for her entire life because she once enjoyed sex with someone she really fancied. It&#8217;s a cruel story which treats Tess as a punching bag, and there&#8217;s absolutely no way to retell it in a feminist light. If you wanted to do so, you&#8217;d have to completely rewrite the story to make it Tess of the Respectable Single Parenthood.</p>

<div><p id="speakable-summary">A new report <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/app-annie-releases-new-gen-z-report-with-insights-on-winning-over-the-mobile-generation-301156764.html">released</a> today by App Annie digs into how Gen Z consumers engage with their smartphones and mobile apps. According to data collected in Q3 2020, Gen Z users spend an average of 4.1+ hours per month in non-gaming apps, or 10% longer than older demographics. They also engage with apps more often, with 20% more sessions per user in non-gaming apps at 120 sessions per month per app, compared with older groups.</p>
<p>This app engagement data is only a view into Gen Z trends but is an incomplete analysis as it only focuses on select markets, including the U.S., U.K., Brazil, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. It also included only data collected from Android devices, which doesn&#8217;t provide as full a picture.</p>
<p>App Annie found that Gen Z is more likely to use games than older users, but they don&#8217;t access them as often or use them as long. Those ages 25 and older actually spent nearly 20% longer in their most-used games and accessed them 10% more frequently. Both demographics spent more total time gaming than using non-game apps, on a monthly basis.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>

When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/aocs-among-us-stream-topped-435000-concurrent-viewers/">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez played the game on Twitch last night</a>, it became one of the biggest-ever Twitch streams, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">peaking</a> at 435,000 concurrent viewers.</p>
<p>Other popular Gen Z games include Match-3 games like Candy Crush Saga and Toon Blast, action games like PUBG Mobile and Free Fire, and casual simulation games like Minecraft Pocket Edition and Roblox.</p>

<p>TikTok and Snapchat, in particular, stood out as the top over-indexed social and communication apps among Gen Z in 9 out of the 10 markets analyzed for this report. This comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/snap-shares-explode-after-blowing-past-earnings-expectations/">Snap&#8217;s blowout earnings yesterday</a>, where the social app topped analyst expectations and saw daily user growth climb 4% to 238M.</p>
<p>Discord is also seeing strong growth, particularly in France, as mobile and remote gaming has become an epicenter of social interactions during the pandemic.</p>

In South Korea, a top app was peer-to-peer payments app Toss, which also offers loans, insurance and credit.</p>
<p>Top Gen Z fashion apps, meanwhile, included Shein, ASOS, Shopee and Mercari.</p>

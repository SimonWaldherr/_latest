The Scouts are embroiled in a bitter fight with the SNP over a "dishonest" party political broadcast featuring a woman dressed in their uniform backing Scottish independence.

Scouts Scotland hit out at the SNP over the broadcast, which featured a cross-section of voters who claimed to have changed their minds since the 2014 referendum and would now back separation from the UK.

They included a woman, named as Helene from Kirkhill, who was in a Scout's uniform. She told viewers: "For my children, I feel that an independent Scotland is going to offer them the opportunity to be part of something bigger."

But the youth charity has strict rules on political neutrality, including forbidding people wearing its uniform taking part in party political activities.

Scouts Scotland yesterday took to social media to register their displeasure, saying they had spoken to the SNP and reported the situation to the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR).

It is understood the complaint was lodged in February after the broadcast was originally shown and talks with the Nationalists failed to resolve the issue.

However, the Scouts went public with their fury after the advert was shown on TV again on Monday evening.

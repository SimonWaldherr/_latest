Democrats had opted to boycott the hearing, leaving no one to oppose the nomination.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called it &#8220;surreal&#8221; for the panel to vote on Barrett&#8217;s nomination without Democrats there. He criticized the Democrats&#8217; placement of pictures on their chairs as theater.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Democrats had said they would boycott Thursday's hearing and vote, hoping to prevent the committee from establishing a quorum. Instead, Democrats plan to hold a press conference Thursday morning during the hearing. The boycott effort appeared to be a longshot&#160;attempt at stalling&#160;the federal judge's&#160;confirmation to the high court but Republicans moved forward without Democrats.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Judge Barrett deserves a vote and she will receive a vote," Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said Wednesday, adding, "As to my Democratic colleagues&#8217; refusal to attend the markup, that is a choice they are making. I believe it does a disservice to Judge Barrett who deserves a vote, up or down."</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Democratic Senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee boycott the committee vote on Amy Coney Barrett to serve as an associate justice on the Supreme Court of the United States during a Senate Judiciary Committee Executive Business meeting on October 22, 2020, in Washington, DC."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Senate Judiciary Committee's rules outline that at least nine members of the majority (Republicans) and at least two members of the minority (Democrats) need to be present to conduct business.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While Democrats boycotting the hearing would technically mean the committee's rules would bar Republicans from moving forward on Barrett's nomination, it wasn't expected&#160;to stop the process.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">The path forward:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/15/amy-coney-barrett-what-happens-next-her-confirmation-process/3664102001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Amy Coney Barrett hearings conclude: Here's what happens next in Supreme Court confirmation</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">No drama?:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/17/amy-coney-barrett-civil-hearings-were-contrast-brett-kavanaugh/3677741001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court hearings lacked the drama that Brett Kavanaugh's proceedings had.

While liberals have harshly criticized the process and Barrett's appointment in the midst of Americans voting in a presidential election, Democrats have acknowledged they don't have the power to halt her confirmation.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Only two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, have voiced opposition to filling the vacancy on the court left by Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death before the election. Two other Republicans would have to join with Democrats in order to halt what appears to be Barrett's inevitable confirmation to the Supreme Court.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While Democrats cannot stop her nomination, they have employed a host of procedural maneuvers to attempt to slow it down.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The vote Thursday follows four days of hearings last week, where senators peppered Barrett with questions for hours about a host of issues that could&#160;come before the high court, including the Affordable Care Act, abortion, voting rights and climate change.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/politics/2020/10/13/amy-coney-barrett-testifies-during-senate-confirmation-hearings/5978414002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">During the hearings:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/13/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-nominee-strives-show-independence/3638652001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett strives to show independence from White House, Republicans</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">How Barrett could shift the court:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/27/amy-coney-barrett-how-supreme-court-could-change-6-conservatives/3536634001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Six conservative justices? 10 ways the Supreme Court could change</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Barrett&#160;dodged answering many inquiries that dealt with contentious issues, frustrating Democrats who were eager to derail her confirmation, while vowing to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/13/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-nominee-strives-show-independence/3638652001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">keep an open mind </a>on any issue that comes before her on the court.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Since Ginsburg died in September, both sides have fought over how to go about replacing her on the court.

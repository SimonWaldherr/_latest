A CNN reporter has been caught on camera telling a raccoon to “get lost” on the lawn outside the White House in the latest confrontation between journalists and the gang of furry foes.

The reporter Joe Johns was only seconds before updating the nation on the president’s condition on Wednesday when his attention was turned to something approaching behind him.

“Get”, he shouts at the offscreen adversary before exclaiming: “there he is.”

He then bends down to find something to ward off the raccoon, throwing what looks like a cardboard box to deter it and roaring comically before turning his attention back to the bulletin.

“Damn… frickin raccoons man,” he says following the segment. “God, again. That’s the second time…it only comes around right about when I’m going to go on TV.”

In a tweet following the encounter Mr Johns confirmed that “No animals were harmed” during the scuffle.

“So it’s the 2d time in two weeks a raccoon has shown up shortly after the @NewDay open,” he said. “I think they’re attracted to the lights. No animals were harmed. I threw something to scare it off. #CrazyOuttake.”

The incident is just one in a spate of incidents involving the mischievous raccoons that have been harassing reporters outside the white house in recent weeks.

Earlier on Wednesday, Elyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner, a White House producer for NBC News, shared footage showing Secret Service agents trying to “wrangle” one of the raccons from beneath a tree.

“Good morning from the White House, where Secret Service is trying to wrangle a raccoon,” she posted.

Last week, four of the furry pests “attacked multiple news crews on North Lawn” with one photographer and a reporter having their clothes grabbed as they worked.

"Strong Pawnee vibes at White House this morning as a raccoon attacked multiple news crews on North Lawn. allegedly grabbed pant leg of a photographer & then a corespondent before being fended off," tweeted Paula Reid of CBS News.

Pawnee is the fictional Indiana town from NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation, which is overrun by raccoons in the show.

Social media users were quick to make fun of the ongoing tirade with some Twitter users joking they had been sent by Donald Trump to exact revenge.

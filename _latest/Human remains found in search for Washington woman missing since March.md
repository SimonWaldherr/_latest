The remains of a Washington state woman who disappeared in late March have been found in a secluded wooded area, her family said.

The grim discovery was made Saturday during a search for Kenna Harris, 25, and the remains have not yet been positively identified, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office.

But on Facebook, Harris’s family — who were notified of the find — confirmed they were hers.

“With very heavy hearts and lots of tears, we share with you all that Kenna’s body has been found,” the post said on Saturday. “As a family, we take comfort in the fact that Kenna is with God and we know we will be with her again one day. Kenna was the sparkle in our family and our own personal rainbow. We will always miss her.”

Harris, who suffered a traumatic brain injury during a car accident six years ago, had been missing since March 31 when she took a backpack and left her family’s home. She then took a bus from Monroe to Snohomish, where relatives have said it was possible she got into someone’s car at Snohomish Station, a shopping center where she was last seen.

“They may have been someone she recognized or someone friendly,” according to the Facebook page. “We have evidence that she did not have a plan for her day. Kenna is friendly, beautiful and impulsive.”

Prior to her disappearance, Harris took her yoga mat and her daily medications along with $230 she withdrew from her account at Chase Bank, the Everett Herald reported. She then stopped into a Subway sandwich shop in Snohomish to ask if they had any gluten-free bread. An employee there was the last person who reported seeing Harris alive, according to the newspaper.

Harris, who worked as a cashier at Walmart at the time of disappearance, had issues with her memory and decision-making in the aftermath of the car accident, her mother previously told KING-TV.

“She’s up and down,” Kelli Harris said in May. “So, she didn’t want to go to work, she got mad, she left. She’s impulsive. Impulsivity comes along with [traumatic brain injury] … We just keep praying that she told somebody she needed a place to stay maybe? And they took her in.”

Authorities did not specify exactly where the body was found Saturday but said the location was not included in previous ground searches for Harris. A medical examiner will formally identify the remains and determine a cause of death, sheriff officials said.

The statement did not indicate whether any evidence of foul play was found.

 <p>     </p> <p>And with Britain facing a second wave and another potential national lockdown while China is returning to normal, he has put the stark outcomes down to significant cultural differences.</p> <p> "In China if there is a rule, we follow the rule," he told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12959089/china-london-wuhan-coronavirus-obey-rules/" rel="nofollow">The Sun.</a></p> <p>"If we see somebody not following the rules, we don't need to punish them, we need to make sure they are aware of their violations against the rules."</p> <p>He said the majority of the population have been through 15 years of intensive education, meaning people of all ages "believe in the science".</p>

 <p>This contrasts to movements in the likes of Britain and the US where surges are continuing, in which people are questioning the validity of masks and even the virus itself.</p> <p>"We wouldn't say 'let's take the mask off because I can't breathe right', because we know this virus is there," Mr Lu added.</p> <p>He also admitted to reporting his neighbours to the authorities for violating the restrictions - something he said many in China were happy to do.</p> <p>In contrast, the UK's National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) chairman Martin Hewitt had to move to deny that enforcement of the rule of six relied on people "grassing up" their neighbours.</p> <p>"It relies on all of us being responsible," he told BBC Breakfast in September.</p> <p>While the weekend saw British Tier 2 lockdown towns and cities packed with people going to pubs and bars, including Leeds, London and Manchester as cases climb.</p>

 <p>Mr Lu admitted while following restrictions does get in the way of living a normal life, but by going out to bars with friends people are "stealing months of freedom".</p> <p>"If there is no one left, there are no human rights," he added.</p> <p>Across all of China there have been 90,955 official coronavirus cases and 4,739 deaths since December last year.</p> <p>While the latest UK figures show a far higher 705,428 cases since March, with 43,579 fatalities.</p> <p> It comes as the head of the Oxford vaccine Professor Andrew Pollard <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-boss-warns-22841596">warned Britain will be having to wear masks and social distance until July.</a></p> <p>He said strict rules will remain in place even if one the trials proves successful.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>Britain has stockpiled 340 million doses from six prototype vaccines, including from Oxford - the most of any country.</p> <p>"Life won&#8217;t be back to normal until summer at the earliest. We may need masks until July," he said last week.</p> <p>"Until we&#8217;ve got a high level of immunity in the population so that we can stop the virus so most vulnerable people are immune, there is going to be a risk."</p></div>

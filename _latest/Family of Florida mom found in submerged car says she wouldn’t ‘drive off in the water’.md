The family of a missing Florida mom found dead in a submerged car said she wouldn’t “drive off in the water” as they wait for answers from the investigation into her death.

The body of Tracey Lynn Rieker, a 44-year-old mom of four, was discovered in her husband’s green Nissan X-Terra Saturday at the bottom of a pond in Venice after she vanished last month, according to local police.

“I want to know what happened, you know? Obviously she’s not just going to drive off in the water like people are saying,” her sister, Vicky Rios, told news station WBBH.

Rieker had been reported missing from her home Sept. 30 when she left without her wallet and phone, cops said.

“We couldn’t imagine why she wasn’t where she belonged,” her foster sister, Beth Spurry, told the outlet.

Her husband, Christian, immediately alerted authorities since she’d recently undergone a change in behavior and he feared she was suffering a mental breakdown, the Venice Gondolier reported.

She had become more interested in spirituality and was fasting for religious purposes, WTVT reported.

“She was having trouble sleeping and wasn’t eating a whole lot. [She was] really focused on her religious outreach, and so when we woke up [and] the car was gone and she was gone … we just called the authorities,” Christian told the news station.

Police said they ordered an autopsy Monday in the case — which they are treating as a traffic homicide, a standard investigation when a death involves a vehicle.

“Investigators hope to know more about Ms. Rieker’s cause of death following the results, as well as a toxicity screening that could take 6 to 8 weeks,” police said.

<div><p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">In 2012, he and his family were inspired to build and donate a bunk bed after learning there were local children who slept on the floor.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">"This little girl had a nest of clothes, it looked like a little bird's nest. And that's what she slept on, that's what her bed was," Mickelson said. "When we delivered the bed, she hugged it and just couldn't let go."</p><p>Shocked to discover how widespread this need was in his close-knit community, Mickelson founded Sleep in Heavenly Peace , a nonprofit that builds and delivers beds to children in need.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"It was such an eye-opener to me," he recalled. "I sat there in silence thinking, 'Is that really what's going on?'"</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Born and raised in Idaho, Mickelson, now 41, was a high school quarterback-turned-family-man. A churchgoer with a thriving career, he coached his kids' sports teams and fished in the nearby river. But when he met children who were sleeping on the floor, his idyllic life changed course. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"I had no clue about what the need was," Mickelson said. "There's kids next door whose parents are struggling just to put food on the table, clothes on their back, a roof over their head. A bed was just a luxury."</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Using safety guidelines and his daughter's bunk bed as a template, Mickelson started buying wood and supplies to build beds with his own money. He recruited friends and family members to help around the holidays. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">As word spread, interest and involvement from his and other communities surged -- along with Mickelson's bunk bed output.</p><img class="media__image media__image--responsive media__image--cut-format" alt="The &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/01/world/cnnheroes-top-ten-2018/index.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;top 10 CNN Heroes of 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; show that passion + action = change. &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/us/cnnheroes-florence-phillips-esl-in-home-program-of-northern-nevada/index.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Florence Phillips&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, 87, is the founder and director of the ESL In-Home Program in Carson City, Nevada.

Right now, we average over 25 applications a day, nationwide. We don't have any paid staff right now and we're growing like a weed. We're keeping up with that the best we can.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>CNN:</strong> You quit your job and take no salary from the nonprofit. How do you make ends meet?</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>Mickelson:</strong> I quit my job of 18 years because I wanted to do this full-time, or at least as much as I possibly could, because I knew the need was big. It just came to a point where I could see that my passion really is helping these kids. It was gratifying to see my kids and my family be involved with it and help them learn the value of service, but also seeing everybody else feel and see that joy from helping kids get off the floor. It's contagious.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">I was very fortunate to have another company offer me a job. Granted, I took a huge pay cut, but it helps me get by and helps me do what I need to do with Sleep in Heavenly Peace. They're very understanding of what my passion is.  </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>CNN:</strong> How do the children react to their new beds?</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>Mickelson:</strong> When we deliver a bed, that's where the rubber meets the road. We make sure that they understand that, "This is your bed. This is yours. This is a possession of yours," you know? </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The underlying tone is, "We're here for the child." You walk in and these kids are just so excited. They want to help build it. They want to run the drills. They want to bring in wood. Just giving a kid a sense of ownership, a sense of responsibility, as well as a good night's sleep, is tremendous for them. They learn how to take care of things. They learn value. They get confidence -- and they get a good night's sleep. </p><p></p><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-32 cn-zoneAdContainer"></ul><a></a><p>Want to get involved?

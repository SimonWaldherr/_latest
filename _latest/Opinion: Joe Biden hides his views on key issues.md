(CNN) There's some comfort after watching former Vice President Joe Biden's Town Hall on ABC: The 17 million Americans who have already voted didn't miss a thing. It was 90 minutes of nothing new, nothing eventful, nothing earth-shattering. The truth is, no news is just fine when you are the frontrunner. When you're leading key polls by double digits with less than three weeks until the election, you don't run your mouth, you let the clock run out.

I'll lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly from the night.

The good point for Biden is that he managed to often make this a referendum on President Donald Trump. Democrats have to think this is their best strategy. Try and convince the American people that the current President has failed on key issues such as Covid-19, the economy and race relations.

Biden said if he were president, he would lean on governors to mandate mask use.

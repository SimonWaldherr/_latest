Amazon is discounting many of its own devices during Prime Day, including Fire TV streaming players.

The best Fire TV deal today is $40 off the Fire TV Cube (now at an all-time low price of $80).

This streaming box lets you control your TV with just your voice, provides access to 4K ultra-HD content, and is compatible with cable or satellite boxes so you can watch live TV, too.

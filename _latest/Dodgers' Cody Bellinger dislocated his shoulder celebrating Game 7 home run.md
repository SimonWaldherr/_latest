But after the biggest home run of his life, he'd just as soon avoid the pop that followed.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Bellinger made history Sunday night, becoming the first player to hit homers in two Game 7s of the National League Championship Series. And after he ripped a 2-2 pitch from Chris Martin into the right field stands at Globe Life Field, strutted down the first base line and exhorted his Los Angeles Dodgers teammates as he <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/playoffs/2020/10/18/dodgers-braves-nlcs-game-7-mlb-playoffs/3707698001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">tallied the final run in a 4-3 victory</a>, Bellinger got a little too exuberant.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He swung his right arm wide for a powerful forearm bash with teammate Kik&#233; Hernandez.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A bit too powerful.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Bellinger dislocated his shoulder in the celebration, he told MLB Network, and retreated to the training room so it could be popped back into place.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I hit Kik&#233;&#8217;s shoulder a little too hard and my shoulder popped out," Bellinger said. "They had to pop it back in so I could play defense. It kinda hurt.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I&#8217;m going to maybe use my left arm (next time). I&#8217;ve never dislocated that one."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Hernandez had a better explanation in a TV interview: &#8220;Now Belli knows not to mess with people who are way stronger than him."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Bellinger won the 2018 NLCS MVP award and his Game 7 homer was a key in vanquishing the Milwaukee Brewers. This NLCS didn't go quite so well - Bellinger finished it 5-for-24 (.208) with two home runs and nine strikeouts.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Bellinger celebrates his go-ahead home run with Kik&#233; Hernandez in the seventh inning."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But he drew six walks, impressing his teammates with his plate discipline. His career has moved in decidedly non-linear fashion - from 2017 Rookie of the Year, to falling into a platoon role in 2018, to NL MVP in 2019 and then an uneven performance in this pandemic-shortened season - career lows in batting average (.239) and on-base percentage (.333).</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Perhaps his Game 7 home run will signal another upward tick - with a championship on the line, no less.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Cody&#8217;s as talented as any player in baseball," manager Dave Roberts said, "but I think this postseason is showing him the value of controlling the strike zone, winning the pitches, taking the walk and if they make a mistake, you can still slug."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Just be careful when you try to slug one of your teammates.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/mlb/2020/10/11/mlb-playoffs-photos-best-shots-conference-series/5963628002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

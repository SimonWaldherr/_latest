<div><p>A businesswoman from Cheltenham has been forced to sell her home, car and family jewellery, and take on thousands of pounds worth of debt after her income was ravaged by the pandemic, leaving her with suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Nic Mitchell, 53, who runs a property business and media consultancy in the city, says she has been left struggling with her mental health because <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/chancellor-turns-back-millions-excluded-coronavirus-support/">she did not qualify</a> for any forms of government support.</p>
<p>&#8220;I earn about &#163;40,000 a year usually from rental income, but <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy-to-let/landlords-guide-coronavirus-questions-answered/">as a landlord</a> you don&#8217;t qualify for any help from the Government. Only about 10pc of my income comes from my media business, so I wasn&#8217;t eligible for a self-employed grant either.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Ms Mitchell said she was forced to sell old watches and other heirlooms that she treasured to get by.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost everything. I sold my car, borrowed &#163;8,000 and my house is up for sale. I have been incredibly depressed and struggled to find reasons to carry on, especially as my divorce was finalised just before Christmas 2019. I&#8217;m lucky I don&#8217;t have children or anyone who relies on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Senate Democrats blocked a $500 billion slim coronavirus relief bill from Republicans on Wednesday, blasting it as inadequate to address the twin economic and public health crises. Democrats <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-stimulus-plan-senate-fails-move-ahead-vote-against-democrats-2020-9">had dismissed</a> a similar plan over a month ago.</p><p>The vote was along party lines, 51-44.&#160; It fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a speech on the floor the plan was not completely ideal for both sides.</p><p>"The legislation before us is neither Republicans' nor Democrats' idea of a perfect bill. I think we're all clear on that," the Kentucky senator said.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/read-senate-republican-coronavirus-stimulus-2020-10">285-page legislation</a> would implement a $300 weekly federal unemployment benefit through the end of December and provide more forgivable federal loans to small businesses. It would also provide $105 billion to help schools reopen.</p>

<p>"I'm optimistic. There will be a bill," she <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/pelosi-is-optimistic-about-reaching-agreement-on-coronavirus-relief-94315077574?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma">said in an MSNBC interview</a>. "The question is, is it in time to pay the November rent &#8212; which is my goal &#8212; or is it going to be shortly thereafter and retroactive."</p><p>But any bipartisan deal faces significant obstacles, particularly from Senate Republicans. In addition, stimulus talks have progressed erratically for several weeks.</p><p>McConnell has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-white-house-stimulus-deal-republicans-democrats-before-election-2020-10">warned the White House</a> against striking a deal before the election, saying it could complicate their speedy timeline to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court next week.</p><p>A sizable minority of GOP senators have raised concerns against further deficit spending. Many economists, though, are urging Congress to authorize more federal relief to prop up an economy that's showing signs of weakening. Job growth slowed considerably last month and weekly unemployment claims remain far above pre-pandemic levels.</p>

For the first time since their humble beginnings in 2014, the trio of <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/kofi-kingston">Kofi Kingston</a>, Big E and Xavier Woods will compete on different brands.&#160;</p><p class="">Over the last six years, they became one of the greatest tag teams in WWE history as they subversively bucked stereotypes, set new records, and defied established wrestling tropes. </p><p class="">They also achieved one of the most memorable and rewarding WrestleMania moments ever when Kingston fulfilled his dream to become WWE champion in front of the MetLife Stadium crowd in 2019.</p><p class="">These real-life friends overcame the initial pitch to become preachers and morphed into one of the most popular stables in the company. Their unapologetic and unconventional character work made them much more than a comedy act as they stayed true to themselves in an industry full of dated racial gimmicks.</p><p class="">Above all, the true magic of this three-man tandem is their legitimate camaraderie and love for one another. Fans rarely see this type of selflessness in wrestling, and it's evident that The New Day believed a win for one member meant success for the unit. So, it would be totally out of character for the group to implode or turn on one another as other factions do.&#160;</p><p class="">Yes, the way WWE split them didn't make much sense. In fact, it felt entirely unnecessary, but this was probably the best way for the trio to momentarily go their separate ways without a contrived breakup angle. There are interesting stories to tell over the next year as Woods and Kingston remain a tag team on Raw and Big E treks a new path as a singles competitor on SmackDown.&#160;</p><p class="">So, what's next for these three men who came together to change the trajectories of their careers? They've already attained so much, but there's still more they can do if given the chance.&#160;</p></ol>

For most of her professional life, Dr Hannah Fry has dreamt of a day when mathematics hits the front pages. A day when scientists are treated like the public figures they should be; when Britain really cares about numbers; when the streets are abuzz with chatter about not just lies and damned lies, but also statistics…

Well, be careful what you wish for.

“It has been a strange year, in a lot of ways,” says Fry, 36, after a slightly despairing laugh. “All I do is try to get people to pay attention to numbers, now they’re paying attention for the most horrible reason ever.”

I tell her, quite truthfully, that Covid-19 has made me think about stats in more detail than any year since my GCSEs. Probably quite a bit more than that year, actually. Fry – who is quickly becoming the David Attenborough of maths, thanks to a slew of BBC programmes, as well as books, TED Talks and public lectures alongside academic work at University College, London – is sympathetic. “I think that’s the case for everyone.”

We meet outside a plush shopping complex in central London, and shiver in our coats. The arranged indoor option requires we wear masks. Based on all the available evidence, Fry reckons we’re probably better off out here without them.

So then, as the nation’s foremost communicator of impenetrable concepts, does she think Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance have done a good job in their near-daily efforts to explain complex graphs and stats to us laypeople?

“Broadly, yes. It wasn’t an easy job. A good description of those press conferences was ‘number theatre’, because there are subtleties that require nuance to communicate, like false positives and herd immunity. Sometimes, the communication has been blunter than it should have been.”

She gives an example in the daily death toll. A lot of people assume that is the number of people who have died in the last 24 hours, “but it’s the number of deaths reported, so someone could have died months ago. Calling them ‘daily deaths’ masks an important nuance.”

The Bank of England has paved the way for negative interest rates in the face of a looming unemployment crisis, which means the prospect of banks paying you to borrow and charging you to save is moving closer to reality.

The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee announced in September that interest rates would stay at the record low level of 0.1pc.

However, it added that it was exploring how a negative rate could be “implemented effectively, should the outlook for inflation and output warrant it”.

It has now written to banks and lenders to ask about their “readiness to deal” with this eventuality in an indication it could come sooner than expected.

The idea of the drastic move would be to encourage firms to borrow, invest and grow, providing a boost to an economy gripped by one of the worst recessions in history. This would hopefully reduce unemployment and fight off the bleak prospect of deflation – where prices start falling and the economy enters a vicious downward spiral.

But what would negative interest rates actually mean for your personal finances? Will your mortgage lender be sending you a monthly cheque? Will you have to write one for your savings provider? And what will the impact be on markets and our investments?

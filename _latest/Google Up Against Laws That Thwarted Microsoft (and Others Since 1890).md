  Google Up Against Laws That Thwarted Microsoft (and Others Since 1890) 
description: > 
  After a lengthy trial, Microsoft was found to have repeatedly violated the nationâ€™s antitrust laws.The Microsoft case also helps the government make an argument for consumer harm in the Google case.In antitrust, consumer welfare is often associated with a monopolist demonstrating its power by raising product prices to maximize profit.Yet the Microsoft case is also a cautionary example.Without the suit and years of scrutiny, some observers said, Microsoft could have throttled the rise of Google.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">And it worked. After a lengthy trial, Microsoft was found to have repeatedly violated the nation&#8217;s antitrust laws.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;That was the last big win for the government, so it makes sense to map a similar path,&#8221; said Sam Weinstein, a former official in the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division and a professor at the Cardozo School of Law.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Microsoft case also helps the government make an argument for consumer harm in the Google case. In antitrust, consumer welfare is often associated with a monopolist demonstrating its power by raising product prices to maximize profit.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Google&#8217;s search service is free to consumers, which means the government cannot point to rising prices. But prices didn&#8217;t really figure into the Microsoft case, either. The software giant bundled its web browser for free into its dominant Windows operating system.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Consumer harm, the government argued, can result in several ways. Less competition in a market means less innovation and less consumer choice in the long run. That, in theory, could close the market to rivals that collect less data for targeted advertising than Google does. Enhanced privacy, for example, would be a consumer benefit.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;The harm is to competition, and the consumer loses as a result,&#8221; said Tim Wu, a professor at the Columbia Law School (and a contributing New York Times opinion writer).</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Yet the Microsoft case is also a cautionary example. It took years, with a settlement eventually approved in 2002. Its <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/technology/antitrust-tech-microsoft-lessons.html" title="">impact is debated to this day</a>.

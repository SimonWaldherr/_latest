Converse and GOLF le FLEUR* have returned with new colorways of the Gianno. Following their “Parfait Pink” and “Skylight” iterations, the two labels have offered suede-tinged versions this time — coming in “Green” and “Violet.”

The Gianno riffs off Converse’s sportswear heritage and Tyler, the Creator‘s love for ’90s styles, BMX biking and hiking. Majority of its uppers are covered in premium suede, accented by contrasting textures like rubber and ripstop. GOLF le FLEUR*’s floral motif is stamped at the tongue, followed by a set of round laces, ripstop eyelets and thin reflective stripes that frame all of these details. Subtleties like a floral motif and a rubber panel at the rear quarter, petal-shaped heel pulls and small cutouts at the sidewalls round up the uppers’ design. The boisterous ’90s-inspired look is finished off by a chunky cream-colored midsole that offers optimal traction and support.

The Converse x GOLF le FLEUR* Gianno Suede will be available on HBX’s website on Oct 15, 9 a.m. EDT for $128 USD.

In case you missed it, Tyler, the Creator and Jeni’s Splendid Ice Cream have concocted a new “Pluto Bleu” flavor.

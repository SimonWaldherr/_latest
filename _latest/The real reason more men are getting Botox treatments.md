<div><p>Taylor-Brown admits he is something of an outlier. The first time he got&#160;Botox and dermal fillers, in 2018, &#8220;I probably was hoping to look 10 years younger,&#8221; he says. But the results were more subtle:&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s not like you suddenly end up with things I dislike intensely, like duck lips,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People know that something is different without ever realising.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>When Taylor-Brown returned for a follow-up treatment in 2019, his mindset was different. &#8220;The second time I just wanted to look the best version of myself. So I do understand that it isn&#8217;t about looking younger;&#160;it&#8217;s about looking great at your age.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says he&#8217;s noticed a change in how people respond to him.&#160;&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t really name it &#8211; it just felt like I was getting a positive reaction. People would generally go, &#8216;Hey! You&#8217;re looking good&#8217;. It made me feel really good.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t just at work that he noticed the attention.&#160;&#8220;I was getting women smiling at me in the street or in the supermarket for no reason when I was walking along &#8211; and I was thinking, &#8216;That hasn&#8217;t happened for a little while!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor-Brown is hoping to get treatment once a year (although his 2020 treatment has been put on hold due to Covid-19). Even though he hasn&#8217;t had it done in a year, he has noticed his face hasn&#8217;t gone back to how it was before; indeed, on our call, I would have guessed he was in his early 40s, given his smooth forehead and coiffed hair, as opposed to 53.</p>
<p>Men now feel they are able to look after their appearances &#8211; thanks, in part, to social media influencers who are, according to MacGregor, normalising treatment for men. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a mass effect,&#8221; she says. &#8220;As soon as there&#8217;s enough people, it becomes acceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patel, too, believes Botox is starting to lose its taboo for men. &#8220;In the old days, we&#8217;d often see men almost being dragged in and the partner saying &#8216;what can you do with him?&#8217;&#8221; he laughs. &#8220;But nowadays we&#8217;re seeing more [men] taking charge.&#8221; Men are more &#8220;active&#8221; in the consultation, he finds, and seem more comfortable doing their homework and seeking advice.</p>
<p>This boom in male grooming has been liberating, Taylor-Brown says. &#8220;It&#8217;s always been the domain of the woman to look as good as possible, and that&#8217;s fine, but for men it was never considered to be a thing you should even think about &#8211; you just looked how you looked. I don&#8217;t think that has made many men feel happy.&#8221; Now, with men increasingly investing in skincare, hair treatments and non-surgical procedures, Taylor-Brown feels they are more empowered.&#160;</p>

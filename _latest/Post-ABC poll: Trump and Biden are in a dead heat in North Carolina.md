(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p> <p>With the number of coronavirus cases rising across the country, however, the pandemic continues to shadow the president&#8217;s election efforts. Trump has said in recent campaign stops that the nation is &#8220;rounding the corner&#8221; in containing the virus, but the numbers tell the opposite story. A majority of states are seeing increases in cases and hospitalizations are rising in many places.</p> <p>Registered voters in North Carolina disapprove of the way the president has dealt with the crisis, by 53 percent to 45 percent, with 47 percent saying they strongly disapprove. But overall, they are notably less critical of the president on this issue than the country as a whole. Among likely voters in North Carolina who approve of how Trump is handling the coronavirus outbreak, 95 percent support Trump; among those who disapprove, the same percentage support Biden.</p> <p>When asked which of the candidates would best handle the two major issues, Trump is slightly more trusted than Biden to deal with the economy, by 51 percent to 45 percent. Biden is narrowly more trusted to handle the coronavirus pandemic, by 51 percent to 43 percent. Biden&#8217;s margin on trust on the pandemic is smaller than nationally, while Trump&#8217;s margin on the economy is better than his national number.</p> <p>Biden&#8217;s standing is boosted by his support among women, 54 percent of whom support him to Trump&#8217;s 43 percent, though that is smaller than his 23-point advantage among women nationally in a recent Post-ABC poll. Men in North Carolina prefer Trump by a 10-point margin; that group splits evenly between the candidates nationwide.</p> <p>About 9 in 10 supporters of Trump and 9 in 10 supporters of Biden say they are enthusiastic about that support, but there is greater intensity among the president&#8217;s backers. Nearly 3 in 4 Trump supporters say they are very enthusiastic compared with about 6 in 10 of Biden supporters.</p> <p>Interest in the races in North Carolina is extremely high, with 92 percent of registered voters saying they are following the election very or somewhat closely. The same holds for intentions to vote, with 82 percent saying they are certain to vote, 4 percent saying they will probably vote and 9 percent saying they have already voted. Republicans are more likely to say they&#8217;re following the campaign &#8220;very&#8221; closely, 71 percent, compared to 63 percent of Democrats.</p> <p>According to election statistics, more than 1.5 million voters in North Carolina have already cast their ballots, with far more Democrats than Republicans having done so. The Post-ABC poll shows that 16 percent of Democratic registered voters say they have already voted compared with 3 percent of Republican voters, more of whom are expected to cast ballots on Election Day.</p> <a name="ER6KHVQPEUI6XNAERUPGOXWHAE"></a> <img class="unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder " src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif"><br> <p class="pb-caption">President Trump speaks at a rally on Thursday in Greenville, N.C. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)</p> <p>Biden holds a big lead among those who have or plan to vote early, with 6 in 10 saying they support him. Among those who plan to vote on Election Day, over 7 in 10 say they back the president.</p> <p>The poll finds that nearly 2 in 3 likely voters say they plan to vote before Nov. 3. Compared with the country overall, North Carolina&#8217;s early voters heavily prefer in-person early voting over a mail option. Among likely voters who plan to vote early, 74 percent say they plan to vote in person, far higher than the 37 percent of likely voters who planned to vote that way nationwide in a recent Post-ABC poll.</p> <p>Trump holds a clear lead among White voters in North Carolina by a margin of 58 percent to 39 percent. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls/north-carolina/president" target="_blank">Exit polls in 2016 </a>showed Trump winning 63 percent of White voters compared with 32 percent for Hillary Clinton.</p> <img id="g-2-NorthCarolina-keygroups-xxsmall-img" class="g-aiImg g-aiAbs" alt="" src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/graphics/ai2html/keygroups-northcarolina/UUHKNUZMPVHYLCBNGLBC2EMW3U/2-NorthCarolina-keygroups-xxsmall.jpg?v=4"> <p class="g-pstyle0">N.C.</p> <p class="g-pstyle0">Washington Post-ABC News Poll</p> <p class="g-pstyle1">Whom key groups of voters in North Carolina are supporting for president</p> <p class="g-pstyle2">Among likely voters</p> <p class="g-pstyle3">Support</p> <p class="g-pstyle3">Biden</p> <p class="g-pstyle4">Support</p> <p class="g-pstyle4">Trump</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">Likely voters overall</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">49%</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">48%</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">Men</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">43</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">53</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">Women</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">54</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">43</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">White</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">39</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">58</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">Black</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">84</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">14</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">East Carolina</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">46</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">51</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">Raleigh/Durham Triangle</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">68</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">30</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">Charlotte area</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">50</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">47</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">Piedmont/Central</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">44</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">51</p> <p class="g-pstyle5">West Carolina</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">35</p> <p class="g-pstyle6">63</p> <p class="g-pstyle7">Note: Support for Jorgensen, Hawkins, &#8220;Other,&#8221; &#8220;None,&#8221; &#8220;Would not vote&#8221; and &#8220;No opinion&#8221; not shown. </p> <p class="g-pstyle7">Source: Oct. 12-17, 2020, Washington Post-ABC News poll among 646 North Carolina likely voters with an error margin of +/- 4.5 percentage points.

  Like the August story, this story is inaccurate.De Blasio, in reality, is not expected to “torpedo” Cohen’s plans before his approval reaches an owners' vote.De Blasio has enough problems (controlling the COVID-19 shutdown in New York City and avoiding confrontations with Orthodox Jewish leaders) without jeopardizing the lease over a non-issue and enraging the vast majority of Mets fans who want Cohen to own the club.The mayor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although de Blasio did say in August that A-Rod owning the Mets “would be very good for baseball and very good for this country.”

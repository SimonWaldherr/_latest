Ed Woodward is prepared to sack Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer if the club's poor results continue, The Mirror reports.

United have struggled for form in their opening three games of the Premier League campaign, with last Sunday's shock 6-1 defeat to Spurs at Old Trafford piling more pressure on Solskjaer.

And Woodward is reportedly prepared to put sentiment aside to sack the Norwegian, a fan-favourite owing to his heroics as a player under Sir Alex Ferguson.

The United chief is prepared to put sentiments aside to dismiss the popular Norwegian boss

United's chief executive has come under fire for the club's disappointing transfer window, in which they failed in their pursuit for Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho.

Late swoops for Edinson Cavani and Alex Telles did little to ease criticism from United fans, with supporters bemoaning the club's transfer failings while their rivals strengthened their squads.

Yet Solskjaer is expected to bear the brunt of bad performances, should they continue, and the club are still interested in bringing in former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, who is yet to take charge of a side since leaving north London last term.

United have started the season poorly, falling to an astonishing 6-1 defeat to Spurs last week

The Argentine has reportedly rejected jobs elsewhere during his hiatus, with the 48-year-old prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arise.

Solskjaer was appointed as permanent manager in March 2018 after a positive tenure as temporary boss, providing the club a much needed boost following the negativity onset by the Jose Mourinho era.

The Norwegian guided the Red Devils into the top four last campaign, and the club reached three semi finals, but the side's form in the opening stages of this season has provided cause for concern among chiefs.

It doesn't get easier for Solskjaer's side who face a tough run of fixtures later this month

United lost their opening game 3-1 to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford, before scraping past Brighton in a dramatic clash on the south coast which saw the Seagulls strike the woodwork no less than five times.

Sunday's astonishing defeat to Spurs, though, sent shockwaves through the club to the extent that Woodward is reportedly undeterred by Solskjaer's legendary status when it comes to assessing his position as manager.

The United chief is said to have singled out Liverpool's decision to sack icon Kenny Dalglish in 2012 as justification to part ways with the popular Norwegian.

United have a tough run of fixtures coming up after the international break. They first take on Newcastle before facing Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton in the league, as well as Paris Saint-Germain and RB Leipzig in Europe.

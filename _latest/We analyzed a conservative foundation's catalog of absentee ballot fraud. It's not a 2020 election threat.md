<div><p class="dropcap">Leila and Gary Blake didn&#8217;t want to miss elk hunting season.&#160;</p><p>It was 2000, and the <a href="https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/wyoming/pair-admits-guilt-to-voting-fraud/article_3bf66f52-a167-522b-83fc-5797314a3e11.html" target="_blank">election conflicted with their plans</a>, so the Wyoming couple requested absentee ballots.&#160;</p><p>But the Blakes had moved from 372 Curtis Street five miles down the road to 1372 Curtis Street, crossing a town line. When they mailed their votes using the old address, they were criminally charged. The misdemeanor case was settled with $700 in fines and a few months' probation, but two decades later, the Blakes are still listed as absentee ballot fraudsters in the Heritage Foundation&#8217;s Election Fraud Database.</p><p>Far from being proof of organized, large-scale vote-by-mail fraud, the Heritage database presents misleading and incomplete information that overstates the number of alleged fraud instances and includes cases where no crime was committed, an investigation by USA TODAY, Columbia Journalism Investigations and the PBS&#160;series, FRONTLINE found.&#160;</p><p>Although the list has been used to warn against a major threat of fraud, a deep look at the cases in the list shows that the vast majority put just a few votes at stake.</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/05/29/USAT/12e8290d-df00-4e48-b8e4-a7e9f0c0d444-AP_Election_2020_De_Blasio.JPG?width=7" alt="Fox News host Sean Hannity has repeatedly touted the Heritage Foundation's database of election fraud cases."><p class="image-zoom__modal-trigger"></p><p class="in-depth-image-caption-container">Fox News host Sean Hannity has repeatedly touted the Heritage Foundation's database of election fraud cases.<p class="in-depth-image-credit">Frank Franklin II, AP</p></p><p>The database is the result of a years-long passion project by Hans von Spakovsky, a former member of the U.S. Department of Justice during the George W. Bush administration and a senior legal fellow with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The entire Election Fraud Database contains 1,298 entries of what the think tank describes as &#8220;proven instances of voter fraud.&#8221; It has been amplified by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=2EuhJ3L_VT4" target="_blank">conservative media stars</a> and was submitted to the White House document archives as part of a failed effort to prove that voter fraud ran rampant during the 2016 election.</p><p class="full-width-container"></p><p>But the Blakes' address violation is typical of the kind of absentee ballot cases&#160;in the database. It appears along with widows and widowers who voted for a deceased loved one, voters confused by recent changes to the law and people never convicted of a crime.</p><p>The Heritage database does not include a single example of a concerted effort to use absentee ballot fraud to steal a major election, much less a presidential election, as <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-joe-biden-can-only-win-rigged-el/" target="_blank">President Donald Trump has suggested</a> could happen this year. Though Trump has repeatedly claimed that absentee ballot fraud is widespread, only 207 of the entries in the Heritage database are listed under the fraudulent absentee ballot category. Not only is that a small slice of the overall Heritage database, it represents an even smaller portion of the number of local, state and national elections held since 1979, which is as far back as the database goes.</p><p>To examine the facts behind the rhetoric, reporters looked at each case in Heritage's online category of "Fraudulent use of absentee ballots,&#8221; comparing them with state investigations,&#160;court documents and news clips. Roughly one in 10 cases involves a civil penalty and no criminal charge. Some of the cases, such as the one involving the Blakes, <a href="https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search/#key" target="_blank">do not match the online definition</a> of absentee fraud as stated by the Heritage Foundation itself. Four cases did not involve absentee ballots at all, including a 1996 murder-for-hire case that included a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7244840-Oliveros-PC-Affidavit-1.html#document/p1/a585977" target="_blank">person persuaded to illegally vote using</a> a wrong address.</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/19/USAT/5569b0bd-fabe-491e-80e8-6300d107e735-AP_Election_2020_Early_Voting_Georgia.jpg?width=7" alt="A voter drops their ballot off during early voting, Monday, Oct. 19, 2020, in Athens, Ga."><p class="image-zoom__modal-trigger"></p><p class="in-depth-image-caption-container">A voter drops their ballot off during early voting, Monday, Oct. 19, 2020, in Athens, Ga.<p class="in-depth-image-credit">John Bazemore, AP</p></p><p>In recent months, von Spakovsky has cited the database to warn about the dangers of voting by mail, including during podcast interviews with U.S. Rep.

It did conclude the cases added up to "a molecular fraction" of votes cast nationwide. Von Spakovsky has countered that the database is a sampling of cases that have publicly surfaced.</p><p>"We simply report cases of which we become aware," he said.</p><p>But if the Heritage database is a sample, it points to a larger universe of cases that are just as underwhelming.</p><p>&#8220;It illustrates that almost all of the voting fraud allegations tend to be small scale, individual acts that are not calculated to change election outcomes," said Rick Hasen, election law author and professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine.</p><p>To be sure, there are exceptions. In North Carolina, a Republican political consultant was indicted and the results of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/30/746800630/north-carolina-gop-operative-faces-new-felony-charges-that-allege-ballot-fraud" target="_blank">2018 congressional race overturned</a> based on an absentee ballot operation.</p><p>&#8220;But by and large the allegations are penny-ante," Hasen said.

Trump established a commission to investigate, but ultimately disbanded it without any substantiated findings of widespread voter fraud.</p><p class="in-depth-image-credit">Carolyn Kaster, AP</p></p><p>A review of the absentee cases in the Heritage Foundation database helps explain why the panel came up short, and why such fraud is not a reasonable threat to undermine the 2020 general election.</p><p>In multiple instances, only one or two votes were involved. In other cases, no fraudulent votes were involved but are still included in the database because people ran afoul of rules on helping others fill out ballots or ballot requests. For example, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7037975-Peeps-Corrigan-Eva-CT-2002-Commission-Summary.html" target="_blank">a nursing home worker</a> was civilly fined $100 because she did not sign her name and address as an "assistor" on ballots she helped four elderly patients fill out. In another case, a mother was fined $200 because she signed her sons' <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7037973-Peeps-Stevenson-Lillian-CT-Commission-Findings.html" target="_blank">requests for absentee ballots</a>.</p><p>Events in the database also can be older than they seem&#160;because Heritage frequently categorizes entries by dates of an indictment, report or conviction, which may come years after the fraud. Using the year of the incident, 137 of 207 cases occurred before 2012.</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/19/USAT/22a7afbb-3156-4e0a-be14-02aa9d91b017-GTY_1228946453.jpg?width=7" alt="Working in bipartisan pairs, canvassers process mail-in ballots in a warehouse at the Anne Arundel County Board of Elections headquarters on October 7, 2020 in Glen Burnie, Maryland.

Of those cases, 39 of them &#8212; involving 66 people &#8212; represent cases in which there seemed to be an organized attempt to tip an election, based on reporting and the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search/#key" target="_blank">group&#8217;s own description</a>.</p><p>Further, the database describes &#8220;cases,&#8221; not individuals charged. However, the total number of cases became inflated after Heritage began counting every person involved in a criminal ring as a separate case.</p><p class="full-width-container"></p><p>&#8220;Each individual is a separate case and involved different &amp;mldr; acts of voter fraud,&#8221; even if the parties conspired, von Spakovsky said. The Heritage Foundation may reconsider how groups of defendants are counted, but if anything, he said, the number of cases is undercounted, not overcounted.</p><p>But the details of the cases compiled in the database undermine the claim that voter fraud is a threat to election integrity.</p><p>In Seattle, an elderly widow and a widower appeared in court the same day, having voted for their recently deceased spouses &#8212; two of 15 in the database where an individual&#160;cast the ballot of a recently deceased parent, wife or husband. "The motivation in these cases was not to throw an election," the prosecutor of the Seattle case <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Two-who-voted-for-dead-spouses-are-fined-250-1175087.php" target="_blank">told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>.

Ben Cooper and 13 other individuals faced 243 felony charges in 2006 in what was described as Virginia's worst election fraud in half a century. The mayor of tiny Appalachia, Cooper and his associates stole absentee ballots and bribed voters with booze, cigarettes and pork rinds so that they could repeatedly vote for themselves.</p><p>But the case is an example of just how difficult it is to organize and execute absentee fraud on a scale significant enough to swing an election while also avoiding detection. Heritage's compilation of known absentee cases show the schemes repeatedly occurred in local races, frequently in smaller towns where political infighting can be fierce and fraudsters easily identified. Just one voter who told her story to The Roanoke Times unraveled Cooper's ring.&#160;</p><h1 class="cta-headline">Help support quality journalism like this.</h1><a class="uw-btn" href="https://offers.usatoday.com/specialoffer?gps-source=INDEPTHCUSTOMCTA&amp;itm_medium=onsite&amp;itm_source=storytellingStudio&amp;itm_campaign=CAMPAIGN_NAME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subscribe!</a><h1 class="cta-headline">Get news and insights sent to your inbox.

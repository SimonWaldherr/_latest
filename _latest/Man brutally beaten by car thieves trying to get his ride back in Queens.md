<div><p>Car thieves beat and bloodied a 33-year-old man who tried to run them down after they boosted his ride in Queens, police said.</p>
<p>The theft happened around 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, when the 33-year-old left his car running to talk to his co-worker at 98th Street and Jamaica Avenue, according to police and the victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;m having that discussion with him, out of my periphery&#8230; I see my car&#8230; reversing and I realized someone was stealing my car,&#8221; the 33-year-old told The Post.</p>
<p>The man followed his car to 102nd Street, where the duo pulled over and was rummaging through his stuff, he said.</p>
<p>The victim opened a car door, and one of the thieves reversed the car &#8212; slamming into another vehicle and sending the victim flying, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They crashed my car with me in it just trying to get the keys out,&#8221; the bloodied victim said, stanching a gash on his head with a towel.</p>
<p>He tried again to snatch the keys back but the thieves started attacking him.</p>

 
	<p>&#8220;They hooked up with a third guy who came out, chased me and tried to assault me and these two were already assaulting me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little bit sore,&#8221; he added.</p>

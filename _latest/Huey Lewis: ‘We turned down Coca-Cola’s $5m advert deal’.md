Does money make you happy?

Not really. It’s security which is very important, especially if you’re a bit of a celebrity: to ensure privacy, be secure and have a bit of a cushion if you need to get away from a situation. But I believe that money has very little to do with happiness.

What have been your best and worst financial decisions?

Best was a lot of stuff I didn’t do. Worst was back in 1990 or so when Coca-Cola came to us after Michael Jackson had done his highly controversial Pepsi ad. We were the bee’s knees at the time and they wanted to do an ad with The Heart of Rock & Roll.

Coca-Cola offered us at least $5m and I turned it down. Our record was selling, the touring was going well and we were obviously going to have a career, which was all we wanted.

I didn’t want to be tainted with a corporate brush. In those days nobody else had really done it so I said no and six months later the whole corporate/rock’n’roll tie-in thing became the rage and I regretted it.

In the 1980s and 1990s you toured with 14 top 20 hits. How much did you make per show?

We had quite a few shows for 15,000 people that were sold out so the gross was close to £1m over three nights.

Can you remember unusual money-related incidents?

I once stowed away on a plane to London after somebody who picked me up hitchhiking across the country told me how to do it.

Also when I was 16 or 17 I was hitchhiking in Spain, trying to get to Portugal, and lost my passport. I had to go back to Seville to the embassy and get one but I didn’t have $20. So I had to busk with my harmonica and got discovered by students. I was from San Francisco, had long hair, the Summer of Love thing had exploded and they liked my stories.

When they heard I needed money to get a passport they threw a concert for me. Not only did I get the $20 and some but a bell went off in my head. I thought, if I can make money doing this, this is what I want to do.

I went back to study electrical engineering at Cornell, but changed my mind, went back to school, joined bands and two years later dropped out and became a musician.

When Fore! reached the Top 10 in 13 countries, did you capitalise on the success?

I’d toured in a band called Clover with Thin Lizzy and also Graham Parker and got booed off pretty much every stage in Britain.

So when our record went to number one in America my manager asked what next. I said Europe. You could almost hear record companies gasp because we’d sold zero records.

The Marquee Club was our first gig. We got a good review and the next day the Dominion Theatre, which later we held for a month, sold out.

In European countries we sold only a few hundred records, but when we arrived the record company would wine and dine us because we were selling 200,000 records a week in America – in many cases spending more on the dinner than they’d made on all their record sales. But we ended up with gold records in most of them.

Have you saved for your retirement?

Yeah. Good thing because I lost my hearing two years or so ago and I can’t perform. So it’s a good thing I’m frugal and an investor because I’m living off my savings.

How much did you make from The Power of Love?

I don’t know. The Power of Love was written for Back to the Future and was owned by MCA Records who put it on their soundtrack album, which was a terrible record. It sold under 500,000, compared to the next soundtrack records, Flashdance and Dirty Dancing, which both sold in the tens of millions.

We were only allowed to put The Power of Love on our records internationally, so we put it on Fore! and it was an international hit. Thanks to the movie as well we toured the world and it propelled sales of Fore! extensively and we were multi-platinum in Britain.

What were you paid for your cameo role in Back to the Future?

I think $430. I was reluctant because I’m not an actor but we thought it’d be fun if they disguised me and didn’t credit me.

How much have lawsuits cost you?

A bit. We had a dispute with Ghostbusters which I’m not allowed to talk about because of a gag clause and last time I did I got sued.

What are the best and worst things you’ve ever bought?

Best, my cell phone. I’m old enough to remember when there were no cell phones or computers. Not only do they do amazing stuff, they’re so durable. Worst, a cute little horse trailer my horse couldn’t fit into.

Weather, the latest album by Huey Lewis and the News, is out now. The musical Back to the Future is booking tickets for 2021

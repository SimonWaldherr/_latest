  US workers file 787,000 new jobless claims amid COVID crisis 
description: > 
  The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to 787,000 last week despite continued pressure on the labor market from the coronavirus pandemic, the feds said Thursday.Last week’s initial jobless claims nevertheless brought the total filed during the COVID-19 crisis to more than 65.1 million — a number equivalent to nearly 41 percent of the nation’s total workforce.The latest filings marked a surprise decrease from the prior week’s revised total of 842,000 and came in below economists’ expectations for 860,000 new claims, the US Department of Labor figures show.The feds recorded 158,877 new filings from California last week, a significant decrease from the placeholder figure of 226,179 that was reported last week.But last week’s total was still well above the pre-pandemic record of 695,000 claims in a single week as well as the Great Recession’s peak of 665,000.

<p>Last week&#8217;s initial jobless claims nevertheless brought the total filed during the COVID-19 crisis to more than 65.1 million &#8212; a number equivalent to nearly 41 percent of the nation&#8217;s total workforce.</p>

<p>California likely played a large role in the drop, as the state finally updated figures after pausing its data for a few weeks to work through a backlog in claims and implement fraud prevention technology. The feds recorded 158,877 new filings from California last week, a significant decrease from the placeholder figure of 226,179 that was reported last week.</p>

  This could be the Duchess of Cornwall's chicest look yet 
description: > 
  The mask was sent to the senior royal by a member of the public, but Topshop has a similar leopard print style on sale for £6 – and in a year without much to dress up for, it is a great way of adding some fun to any ensemble.Even without such an eye-catching mask, the Duchess would have looked particularly on trend.She has worn the pinafore dress by couturier Fiona Clare before, and yesterday paired it with a white silk balloon-sleeve blouse and a cape from the same brand, and finished the look with below-the-knee suede boots.The whole outfit wouldn't look out of place on the pages of a fashion magazine.Added to the look was a diamond, ruby and sapphire horseshoe, which she pinned to her dress and which is an homage to one of King Edward VII's racehorses.

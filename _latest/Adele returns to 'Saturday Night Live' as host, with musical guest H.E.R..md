<div><p>British singer and number one breakup songwriter of the century Adele will return to the Saturday Night Live stage on Oct. 24. Not as a musical guest, but as the episode's host.&#160;</p>
<p>A tweet from her Twitter account confirmed her hosting duties and announced that the musical guest for the episode will be R&amp;B singer H.E.R.</p>
<p>Adele was a musical guest on SNL for the first time in 2008, when she was promoting her debut album 19. She was also a musical guest in 2015, one day after the release of her second album, 25. This will be her first time appearing on the show without being invited as a musical guest.&#160;</p>
<p>Despite only having guested on the show twice before, Adele's music has influenced some of SNL's more popular sketches.&#160;</p>
<p>The Nov. 12, 2011 episode used her song "Someone Like You" in an Emma Stone sketch that quickly became a meme for its way too relatable visual of Stone crying into a tub of ice cream. Several cast members also impersonated the British singer in a 2015 Thanksgiving sketch that used the song, "Hello."</p>
<p></p><p class="vplayer"></p><p>Given her history on the show (and her golden pipes), it's possible that Adele may grace the SNL stage with singing at some point in her episode. Hosting the show will also certainly fuel speculation that her long-awaited third album may be just around the corner.</p>
<p>Fans will have to tune in to Saturday Night Live on Oct. 24 to find out.&#160;</p>

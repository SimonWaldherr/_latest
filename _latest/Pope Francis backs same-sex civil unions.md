<div><p class="css-38z03z">Pope Francis has backed same-sex civil unions in a move that is likely to further enrage his conservative opponents in the Catholic church.</p><p class="css-38z03z">His endorsement came in an interview in a documentary film, Francesco, which premiered at the Rome film festival on Wednesday.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">He said: &#8220;Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God. What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.&#8221;</p><p class="css-38z03z">The feature-length film, directed by Evgeny Afineevsky, tells the story of Francis&#8217;s papacy over the past seven and a half years, covering many of the trips he made before the Covid-19 pandemic and his handling of the sexual abuse scandals that have engulfed the church.</p><p class="css-38z03z">It also focuses on issues that Francis has made the hallmarks of his papacy, including the environment, poverty, migration, and inequality.</p><p class="css-38z03z">As pope, Francis has never previously publicly backed civil unions for same-sex couples, although as he endorsed such legal arrangements when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires.</p><p class="css-38z03z">&#8220;This is the first time as pope he&#8217;s making such a clear statement,&#8221; Father James Martin, a prominent Jesuit who has argued that the church should be more welcoming to LGBT people, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/pope-francis-civil-unions/2020/10/21/805a601c-139e-11eb-a258-614acf2b906d_story.html">told the Washington Post</a>.</p><p class="css-38z03z">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a big step forward. In the past, even civil unions were frowned upon in many quarters of the church. He is putting his weight behind legal recognition of same-sex civil unions.&#8221;</p><p class="css-38z03z">Since he was elected pope in March 2013, Francis has sought to adopt a more inclusive tone towards LGBT people in his public statements.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Soon after becoming pope, he said in response to a question about gay priests: &#8220;Who am I to judge?&#8221;</p><p class="css-38z03z">Last month, he <a href="https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/13387/gay-children-are-children-of-god-pope-tells-parents">reportedly told a group representing the parents of LGBT children</a> that &#8220;God loves your children as they are&#8221; and &#8220;the pope loves your children as they are, because they are children of God&#8221;.</p><p class="css-38z03z">In 2018, Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse who met the pope &#8211; and who features in the documentary &#8211; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/20/pope-juan-carlos-cruz">said</a>: &#8220;He told me: &#8216;Juan Carlos, that you are gay does not matter. God made you like this and loves you like this and I don&#8217;t care. The pope loves you like this. You have to be happy with who you are.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p class="css-38z03z">According to traditional church teaching, marriage can only be between a man and a woman, and the church has opposed legal recognition of same-sex unions.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Pope Francis&#8217;s conservative opponents have been infuriated by statements that they regard as part of an effort to shift the the church towards progressive values. Some have publicly attacked him, even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis">accusing him of heresy</a>,</p><p class="css-38z03z">Afineevsky, an award-winning Russian-born director, said he hoped the film would be released for home streaming.</p><p class="css-38z03z">&#8220;If before he was able to travel to every periphery in the world, right now, only his words can travel. That&#8217;s why for me releasing the movie right now was so important &#8211; so that his words and his actions can travel around the world,&#8221; he said.</p></div>

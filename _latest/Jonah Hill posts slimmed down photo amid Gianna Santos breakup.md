A post shared by Jonah Hill (@jonahhill) on Oct 10, 2020 at 12:00pm PDT

Amid his breakup from fiancée Gianna Santos, Jonah Hill posted a slimmed down photo of himself rocking a bushy beard to Instagram on Sunday.

Posing in a bucket hat in front of a table full of food, the 36-year-old “Wolf of Wall Street” star captioned the snap, “I always feel very vulnerable when I shave my beard.” Swiping on the photo revealed a closeup photo of a wizened tortoise.

The actor also ended his note with a reminder to vote in the upcoming election.

“I’m more interested in that delicious take out but you look great either way (I’m hungry),” Rashida Jones commented, while pal Seth Rogen wrote, “I feel like a baby seal.”

News broke on Tuesday that Hill and Santos split a year after getting engaged. The split is said to be amicable.

Page Six exclusively revealed in September 2019 that the “Maniac” star had proposed to Santos, who works as a content manager at a beauty startup.

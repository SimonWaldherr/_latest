  Yannick Ngakoue Reportedly Traded to Ravens from Vikings for Draft Picks 
description: > 
  The Minnesota Vikings announced Thursday they traded Ngakoue to the Baltimore Ravens.ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the Vikings sent a 2021 third-round pick and a conditional fifth-rounder in 2022 to Baltimore.Minnesota acquired Ngakoue from the Jacksonville Jaguars in August, giving up a 2021 second-rounder and a conditional fifth-round pick in 2022.Still, that raised the risk of Ngakoue becoming a one-year rental for the Vikings, which is what happened with Jadeveon Clowney and the Seattle Seahawks in 2019.The Ravens will now have Ngakoue at one end and five-time Pro Bowler Calais Campbell on the opposite side.

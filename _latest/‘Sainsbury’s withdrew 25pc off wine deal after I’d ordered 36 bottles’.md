<div><p>I&#8217;m afraid that even after I raised this point, Sainsbury&#8217;s is still satisfied that it made the terms of the deal sufficiently clear. As such, it is not willing to honour the discount. You say it would be relatively easy for it to build a warning into its website about the possibility of deals expiring in between ordering and delivery. I think you raise a very good point, which I have asked Sainsbury&#8217;s to consider for the future.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the issue of supermarket deals may appear trivial for inclusion in this column, but in fact they are used by millions of shoppers, who could all see their bills affected. As and when I see an opportunity for improvement I will push for it. In the meantime, my advice to Sainsbury&#8217;s shoppers is to pay special attention to the small print, to avoid falling into similar traps.</p>
<p>A Sainsbury&#8217;s spokesperson said, &#8220;Unfortunately, Miss S placed her order while the promotion was live but arranged for her shopping to be delivered a week after it ended. We have apologised for the disappointment this may have caused.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know Sainsbury&#8217;s apology will not make up for the &#163;45.98 refund you feel you are owed. What a shame, as this deal was designed to please you, but has had the opposite effect. Still, if you want to take the edge off your disappointment tonight by cracking open some plonk, at least you will be spoiled for choice.</p>

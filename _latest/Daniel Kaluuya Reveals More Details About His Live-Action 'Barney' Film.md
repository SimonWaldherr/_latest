<div><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>In what seems like an April Fool&#8217;s Day prank spun wildly out of control, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/53jbkn/daniel-kaluuya-early-works-interview">Daniel Kaluuya</a> (star of Get Out, Queen &amp; Slim and, of course, Skins) is co-producing a gritty reimagining of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmzgbw/the-guy-who-played-barney-the-dinosaur-now-runs-a-tantric-sex-business">Barney and Friends</a>, the 1990s TV show about a purple T-Rex who teaches children life lessons about friendship &#8211;rather than attacking and eating them, as would be realistic. In a <a href="https://ew.com/movies/daniel-kaluuya-judas-and-black-messiah/">recent interview </a>with Entertainment Weekly, Kaluuya revealed more details about what we can expect.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Kaluuya said: &#8220;Barney taught us, &#8216;I love you, you love me. Won&#8217;t you say you love me too?&#8217; That&#8217;s one of the first songs I remember, and what happens when that isn&#8217;t true? I thought that was really heartbreaking. I have no idea why, but it feels like that makes sense. It feels like there&#8217;s something unexpected that can be poignant but optimistic. Especially at this time now, I think that&#8217;s really, really needed.&#8221;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>The film, which will be a co-production between Kaluuya&#8217;s own company 59% and Mattel Films (the cinema division of the world&#8217;s second largest toy brand after Lego), was first announced last October. Back then, Kaluuya <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/barney-movie-works-mattel-daniel-kaluuya-1248599">told</a> Hollywood Reporter, "Barney was a ubiquitous figure in many of our childhoods, then he disappeared into the shadows, left misunderstood. We're excited to explore this compelling modern-day hero and see if his message of 'I love you, you love me' can stand the test of time."</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>As unusual as this idea might seem, it&#8217;s not an outlier. In good news for children &#8211; along with adults who want the cultural landscape to resemble a &#8220;Things You Only Remember If You&#8217;re A Nineties Kid&#8221; listicle &#8211; there are a whole host of toy-related films in the pipeline. Indie darlings Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig are collaborating on a film version of <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en/article/3k3gn3/greta-gerwig-and-noah-baumbach-are-co-writing-margot-robbies-barbie-movie">Barbie</a>, with Margot Robbie playing the titular doll. I look forward to seeing Quirky-Ennui Barbie tackle an existential crisis at an elite liberal arts college. There are also going to be<a href="https://filmdaily.co/news/hot-wheels-movie/"> films </a>based on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/mattel-partners-with-blumhouse-to-bring-magic-8-ball-movie-to-theaters.html#:~:text=Mattel's%20Magic%208%2DBall%20toy,has%20announced%20in%20recent%20years.">Magic 8 Ball</a>, <a href="https://filmdaily.co/news/hot-wheels-movie/">Hot Wheels</a> (which seems redundant when The Fast and the Furious franchise already exists), Beyblade, Monopoly (would love to see Ken Loach take a stab at this one) and Furbie (which would only really work as as an A24-style psychological horror).</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>If you like Daniel Kaluuya but consider films about toys beneath you, another upcoming project of his might be more up your street: <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/jgxa9k/daniel-kaluuya-black-panther-judas-and-the-black-messiah-movie-trailer">Judas and The Black Messiah</a> tells the story of Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton and his assassination at the hands of the police. It looks good.</p>

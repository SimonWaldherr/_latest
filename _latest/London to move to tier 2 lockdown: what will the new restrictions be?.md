New restrictions banning different households from mixing indoors will be imposed on London from midnight on Friday to prevent rising coronavirus levels.

The city is currently rated "medium" (tier 1) in the new three-tier system of local alerts for England. This puts London with most of the country at the lowest end of the scale, meaning no new restrictions beyond the rule of six and the 10pm curfew.

However, with infection rates rising towards the 100 per 100,000 trigger point, the capital will be placed in tier 2 -- meaning a ban on different households meeting indoors.

London MPs took part in a phone call with care minister Helen Whately at 9:30am on Thursday Oct 15, where they were told of the plans, which were then confirmed by London's Mayor Sadiq Khan.

LAFAYETTE, La. — Hotels here were at capacity as of Friday afternoon, said Craig Stansbury, the director of the parish’s Office of Homeland Security, as many rooms were already occupied with people who had lost their homes during Hurricane Laura.

“That’s why we stressed earlier to evacuate,” he said Friday. “Unless you have family or friends, you’re probably going have to travel out of state to be able to do that.”

That wasn’t possible for Lake Charles resident Stephanie Celestine, who could not drive a far distance for health reasons. Celestine, her daughter and three granddaughters safely made it to shelter at a Holiday Inn in Lafayette. The 55-year-old said most of her neighbors left amid a mandatory evacuation.

“I’m glad they did,” she said, “and I’m praying for the ones that didn’t.”

Celestine worries that the debris remaining in her neighborhood after Hurricane Laura swept through six weeks ago could become perilous if thrown around during Hurricane Delta. She is especially anxious about a tree branch that Laura’s winds launched into the roof of one of her family’s homes. The branch is precariously pinned against an electrical wire. Her family’s other home flooded and is uninhabitable.

Lake Charles resident Adrien Houff has been displaced since Laura tore apart the roof of his three-story apartment building, dumping enough water to seep into his second-floor unit. Mold made his apartment unlivable.

Houff, 42, has spent the past few weeks on the move, first sleeping in a camper and then a hotel here in Lafayette. On Friday, he packed up his remaining belongings to go to Mississippi to stay with family.

Houff wonders what will be left to return to after Delta passes through. A district manager for meter readers, Houff is not sure how many energy jobs there will be left.

Lyon Gardiner Tyler, who has died aged 95, was an American lawyer and historian, but perhaps more of note for being the grandson of the nation’s 10th President, John Tyler, who occupied the White House between 1841 and 1845 – and was born in 1790.

Moreover, Lyon’s father, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Sr, was born some 170 years ago, in 1853. Accordingly, he well remembered the outbreak of America’s Civil War when he was seven. Remarkably, therefore, in just three generations the Tylers spanned almost the whole history of the United States as an independent republic.

The family had a tradition of reproducing late in life. Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Jr, was born in Richmond, Virginia, on January 3 1925. His father was then 72 and two years before had married, as his second wife, his first having died, Sue Ruffin, some 35 years his junior. No doubt bucked by his son’s arrival, Lyon Sr went on to sire Harrison, when he was 75, and then Henry, who died in infancy.

Lyon Sr’s father, the President, had himself been 63 when his son was born, as the fifth of his seven children by his second wife, Julia Gardiner. John Tyler had 15 offspring in all, the most of any President.

His own father, also John, had been born in 1747, in the reign of George II. He became Governor of Virginia, and was a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson, his roommate at the College of William & Mary, Virginia, with which the Tylers were to have a long association.

The younger John Tyler became Vice-President in 1840 as the running mate of William Harrison. He had been put on the Whig ticket, as a slave-owning Southerner, to attract voters who feared that Harrison, and the incumbent President, Martin Van Buren, favoured the rights of central government over those of the individual states.

But Harrison died from pneumonia just a month after his inauguration, at which he had insisted on making a two-hour long speech in the rain to prove his health was strong. Tyler was unexpectedly thrust into office.

Barrett sidesteps question about abortion

It didn’t take long Tuesday for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to be questioned about abortion. And it didn’t take long for her to sidestep the question.

As she did on other hot-button issues, Barrett explained it would be wrong for her to express her view on Roe v Wade or a later abortion case decided by the Supreme Court because a similar case could come before the high court.

“It would actually be wrong and a violation of the canons for me to do that,” Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “It signals to litigants that I might tilt one way or another on a pending case.”

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the panel, called Barrett’s answer “distressing,” and Barrett acknowledged she understood why the question was asked.

But the nominee told the panel, “I don’t have any agenda” to try to overrule Roe or its successor, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, both of which were decided in the 20th century. What she promised to do is to “follow the rules of stare decisis,” or Supreme Court precedent.

Barrett says ‘rule of law’, not her faith, would drive her judgment

Barrett told the committee that while her faith “was important to us,” she would only apply the law to the cases that would come before her as a Supreme Court justice should she be confirmed.

Barrett, whose devout Catholic faith has been the subject of criticism by opponents who say she’s too religiously conservative to serve on the nation’s highest court, said she realized that her private life would be under a microscope by accepting the nomination.

“We knew that our lives would be combed over for any negative detail. We knew that our faith would be caricatured. We knew our family would be attacked,” she said as her husband Jesse, and seven children sat behind her. “And so we had to decide whether those difficulties would be worth it, because what sane person would go through that if there wasn't a benefit on the other side.?”

She continued: “And the benefit I think is I'm committed to the rule of law and the role of the Supreme Court and dispensing equal justice for all."

Graham tries to turn Obamacare arguments against Democrats

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., started Tuesday’s hearing by launching an attack on Obamacare, the issue Democrats fixated on during Monday’s hearing as they laid out their primary reason why they oppose Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court.

Democrats have concerns Barrett will be a – if not the – deciding vote next month on the Supreme Court in a case that could end the Affordable Care Act.

“From my point of view Obamacare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina,” said Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee holding the confirmation hearings. “We want something better. We want something different.”

Graham complained that three states – California, New York and Massachusetts – have received a disproportionately high amount of health care assistance through the decade-old law, while smaller states like his have been shortchanged.

Democratic senators Monday spent most of their time saying that if Barrett was confirmed, millions of Americans would lose not only their insurance through the health exchange and expanded Medicare, but many more would also lose coverage through the law’s requirement that insurance firms cannot deny coverage to people based on a pre-existing medical condition.

Graham said Tuesday he wants a health care plan that gives states like his more of a share of the federal money (like a “block grant”) that also includes the pre-existing condition mandate.

Sen. Thom Tillis, who tested positive for COVID, appears in-person at Tuesday's hearing

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who announced a positive COVID-19 result on Oct. 2, attended in-person Tuesday's confirmation hearing of Amy Coney Barrett after receiving a letter from his doctor clearing him to participate. He wore a mask during the hearing.

“I feel very fortunate that I had a mild case with few symptoms, and I want to thank North Carolinians for their prayers and well-wishes,” Tillis said in a statement, adding that he would take part in antibody studies to promote research on the virus.

His office released a letter dated Oct. 12 from his personal physician Dr. Jack Faircloth telling Tillis he would fulfill the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for ending quarantine of “at 4 pm today.”

The CDC says people who tested positive for COVID-19 are cleared to interact with others after quarantining for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms, remaining fever-free for at least a day, and remaining free of other symptoms.

It is unclear if Tillis tested negative for COVID-19. He is one of two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. The other lawmaker, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, came back to the hearings on Monday. His office released a letter from the Office of the Attending Physician clearing him to attend.

Biden says he's 'not a fan of court packing'

Former Vice President Joe Biden told Cincinnati television station WKRC-TV on Monday he was “not a fan of court packing.”

Biden said in the television interview he did not want to focus too much on the issue, though, added, “the president would love nothing better than to fight about whether or not I would in fact pack the court or not pack the court.”

The potential expansion of the Supreme Court has become a flashpoint on the campaign trail. Some progressives suggested adding seats to the court if they win the presidency and Senate in November in response to Republicans’ nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat. Conservatives hammered Biden over his evasion of questions on the topic.

Biden had said he opposed expanding the size of the Supreme Court during the primary campaign but had evaded the question as the Democratic presidential nominee, saying last Friday voters “don’t deserve” to know his position on court expansion before the election.

Congress can change the size of the Supreme Court if it passes legislation to do so and a president signs it into law. It has not changed the size of the Supreme Court since 1869, when the Judiciary Act of 1869 set the number of justices at nine.

Senators to question Amy Coney Barrett at Day 2 of hearings

WASHINGTON – Senators are set to question President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the second day of the planned four days of confirmation hearings take place on Capitol Hill.

Every senator will get to question Barrett for a half-hour, and the nominee is sure to face tough questions as she moves through the process to succeed Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham warned Monday of a "long, contentious week" ahead of the lawmakers.

Democrats are likely to ask Barrett about health care, having settled on the topic as the focal point of their message as they oppose her nomination.

Following Monday's hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, told reporters, "we believe the Affordable Care Act is hanging in the balance on this decision of filling this vacancy on the Supreme Court. We're going to drive that issue home to our colleagues on the other side."

Republicans aim to confirm Barrett to the Court before Election Day, but The Senate Judiciary Committee will not vote on Barrett's confirmation this week. The committee won’t vote until after it holds her nomination for one week, a common practice by the panel. The committee vote is expected around Oct. 22 and is likely to split along party lines, 12-10. Then her nomination will go to the full Senate, where she will need at least a majority to be confirmed to the high court.

Democrats acknowledge they lack the votes to block her confirmation. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told reporters no matter what obstacles Democrats threw up against the nomination process, "to be honest, as good as we are, it's probably not going to change the trajectory of this nomination."

Republicans, on the other hand, bat aside the criticism on health care, arguing the court makes decisions based on the law, not policy.

"It's pretty clear they want to talk about the Affordable Health Care Act in terms of policy. The judge will decide the merits based on the law," Graham told reporters.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in an online news conference after the hearing that Democrats opposed Barrett because "they're worried about is that having a constitutional jurist as the next justice on the Supreme Court" who "would block them from implementing Medicaid for all that is their goal they started out with Obamacare."

The first day of hearings finished without many fireworks as Barrett gave her opening statement and senators spoke one-by-one.

Republican senators and conservative activists said the Barrett hearings went well and said things appear to be on track for confirmation later this month.

"Judge Barrett did remarkably well," said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, during a Zoom call with conservative organizations that are sponsoring ads and promoting Barrett's nomination.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., said Senate Democrats spent most of their time attacking President Donald Trump's desire to fill the court slot, saying little about Barrett's qualifications or record.

"They barely mentioned her name," Cruz said.

Cruz and others on the call predicted to supporters that Barrett would soon become Justice Barrett.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said her organization and others are appealing up persuadable voters about the Barrett nomination.

"This will be an important piece on Election Day," she said.

Democrats eschewed any attacks on Barrett's personal background, despite accusations from Republicans they were assailing the nominee's faith and background.

"We have taken an oath to a constitution that says no religious test," said Durbin. "Enough said."

She took the music world by storm last year with the release of her debut studio album When We all Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?

And Billie Eilish traded in her signature oversized threads for an uncharacteristically casual fashion statement on Sunday in Los Angeles.

The 18-year-old musician rocked a tan monochrome ensemble while running errands with friends in Southern California.

Billie kept things simple wearing a strappy nude tank top with a pair of comfortable sweat shorts.

She managed to add just a touch of her funky style to an otherwise muted outfit with a pair of Gucci logo socks.

Eilish — who's full name is Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell — rocked a pair of brown Adidas YEEZY Slides which retail for $55, but can sell upwards of $400 from second-hand retailers.

Her electric green hair was tied back into a messy bun and she appeared to be relatively makeup-free.

Her first studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? was released in March 2019 and earned the top spot across global music charts, with idol Justin Bieber even collaborating on a remix of her popular hit Bad Guy.

She received five Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards and One Brit Award for the album which included six top hits.

She released her debut single Ocean Eyes in 2016 and an EP the following year, and has earned seven gold and two platinum singles through the Recording Industry Association of America.

Eilish sang the James Bond theme for No Time To Die, which also became her first No. 1 single in the UK.

Billie was born and raised in the Highland Park area of Los Angeles and began singing at a young age thanks in part to her parents Maggie Baird and Patrick O'Connell, both of which supported her interest in the entertainment industry.

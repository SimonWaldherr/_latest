The largest World War II bomb ever found in Poland exploded underwater as specialists attempted a delicate operation to defuse it.

An earth-shaking blast from the 5.4-ton “Tallboy” bomb was unleashed by Polish naval demolition experts Tuesday near the country’s Port of Szczecin, where it was discovered last year, the Evening Standard reported.

More than 700 people were evacuated from the area for the operation, which aimed to “neutralize” the explosive remotely using a technique called deflagration — which involves heating the bomb until it burns rather than detonating it.

But the bomb exploded anyway, with dramatic video footage showing water shooting into the air in the Baltic Sea shipping canal.

Nobody was injured and a Polish navy spokesman ultimately said the mission was a success.

“The operation was carried out perfectly and safely and the bomb is safe now,” Lt. Col. Grzegorz Lewandowski said.

The 19-foot-long bomb — also known as an earthquake bomb — was spotted poking out of the waterway in September 2019 as a construction crew worked to deepen the passage.

Designed by British aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis, the explosive was made to wipe out big swaths of Nazi-controlled property via underground explosions.

It was likely meant to be used in April 1945 to destroy the German battleship Luetzow, but experts don’t know why it failed to go off.

The Port of Szczecin is near the resort of Swinoujscie, a popular hub for Nazis during the war.

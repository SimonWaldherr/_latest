<div><p>New York (CNN Business) Apple's new iPhone 12 lineup has some strong selling points &#8212; 5G connectivity, dual cameras (three on the Pro versions), a powerful processor and a thinner, lighter design than the iPhone 11.</p><p>But the reality is that, despite discounts from mobile carriers , not everyone will be able to shell out $700 or more on a new smartphone (the devices start at $699 for the iPhone 12 mini ). That's perhaps more true right now than ever, as the world grapples with an economic recession caused by a global pandemic.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph speakable">If that's you, and you're still in need of an upgrade &#8212; whether to another iPhone or a different 5G device &#8212; here are some options that will be easier on your wallet. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>If you still want 5G.... </h3></p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>Google Pixel 4a 5G</strong></p><a></a><a></a><p>For most people, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/business/what-is-5g/index.html" target="_blank">5G</a> won't be enough of a reason on its own to be worth upgrading for.

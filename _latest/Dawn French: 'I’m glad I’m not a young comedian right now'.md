Now 62, what sets her apart is the way she has chosen to handle those challenges – from her father’s suicide when she was 19, to racist abuse when she married fellow comedian Lenny Henry in 1984, a series of miscarriages and failed IVF treatments, her divorce from Henry in 2010, and a very public court case earlier this year when their daughter, Billie, was given an eight-month suspended sentence for harassing a former boyfriend.

Guided by her beloved mother, Roma, whom she lost to lung cancer in 2012, she has always chosen to push forward, be compassionate and ‘to listen and to learn from every single thing’. As a woman, a performer and particularly as a writer, it gives her a warmth, humanity and relatability that in part explains her huge popularity. Last year, a YouGov survey placed French as the most popular comedian in Britain.

When she married Henry, who was born in Dudley, West Midlands to Jamaican immigrant parents, the couple became a target for racists, with excrement being smeared on their doorstep and an attempt to burn down their house. ‘It was shocking, but you have to get past that,’ she has said.

I ask her how she feels – in the light of the Black Lives Matter movement – about comedians from John Cleese to David Walliams and Matt Lucas having shows and sketches removed from UK streaming platforms for blackface and racial slurs.

‘I said to Jennifer, “We are lucky we didn’t do that.” And her response was, “But we would not have done that.” And she’s right. I played Samuel L Jackson and Missy Elliott and neither of us even thought to put on a black face. We were awake as opposed to “woke”.

‘Lenny actually started out in The Black and White Minstrel Show as the only black person in it. At the time he didn’t think how terrible it was and I remember watching it with my parents and just seeing it as an entertainment show. But then you become aware. Lenny was completely traumatised by having been a part of that.’

She pauses and says, ‘But I do feel conflicted. I remember enjoying those shows [Fawlty Towers and Little Britain] and not being offended by them, but now it makes you think, “Should I have been?” I don’t know the answer. Comedy is meant to be on the edge. I’m just glad I’m not a young comedian right now.’

She adds: ‘I think we have to learn from this, but in my book I have written black characters – women and a man. And I feel very strongly that as a writer I should be able to do that. They are part of my life, part of me. And I also feel a black writer should be able to write white characters.’

Getting to talk to French today has not been without its difficulties. We try – and I fail – to connect by Zoom. After 10 minutes of attempting to fix technical issues I’m relieved to hear her chuckle and shout cheerily, ‘I’ll call you on your mobile.’

As a woman who has written every one of her five bestselling books (two memoirs, three novels) by hand, she has every sympathy with a fellow Luddite.

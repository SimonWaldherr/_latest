The OnePlus 8T costs $750 and is available to preorder from the OnePlus website now.

It'll be available to preorder from T-Mobile on October 16, and the phone will be released and available to buy on October 23.

The OnePlus 8T comes with high-end specs, features, and design for a price that seems affordable in comparison with other phones with similar specs that sell for $1,000.

With that in mind, the $700 smartphone category is growing, and OnePlus has some serious competition, especially from Samsung.

OnePlus launched its latest phone on October 14. It's called the OnePlus 8T, it starts at $750, and comes with high-end specs, features, and design.

The OnePlus 8T is available for preorder now from the OnePlus website and on October 16 from T-Mobile. It'll become available to buy from the OnePlus website and T-Mobile starting on its October 23 release date.

With a powerful processor, multiple cameras, a large screen with a high refresh rate, a big battery, 5G connectivity, and a premium design, the OnePlus 8T's specs and pricing places it in direct competition with Samsung's $700 Galaxy S20 FE, Motorola's $700 Edge, Google's $700 Pixel 5, and Apple's $600 iPhone 11 and $700 iPhone 12.

More specifically, the Galaxy S20 FE offers very similar specs and a lower price tag. For the first time in recent memory, a Samsung phone may have a OnePlus phone beat for price and value relative to specs and features.

16-megapixel standard wide Battery: 4,500Ah with insanely fast 65W charger included

4,500Ah with insanely fast 65W charger included Water resistance: Not standard, only available on $750 Plus model sold by T-Mobile

Not standard, only available on $750 Plus model sold by T-Mobile 5G: T-Mobile sub-6GHz only

The absurdly fast charger that comes with the phone is worthy of note because it easily outperforms anything that comes with any other smartphone.

While the phone has specs that make it a strong competitor with other phones in the $700 range, there are some things about the OnePlus 8T buyers should know. For one, official water resistance is exclusive to the OnePlus 8T "Plus" model that's being sold by T-Mobile.

And while it touts 5G connectivity, it only does so with T-Mobile's 5G network. AT&T and Verizon users will be stuck with 4G LTE. To be honest, at this stage, that's perfectly fine. 5G — and T-Mobile's 5G network specifically — hasn't delivered the crazy speeds the telecoms industry has promised, and it's largely underwhelming in reality. 5G networks, including T-Mobile's, are bound to improve over time, but that could take some time.

OnePlus' choice to add a 5-megapixel macro lens that's designed to take up-close photos of objects instead of a zoom lens that takes photos of objects far away may be questionable — it's the complete opposite direction that Samsung is going with its impressive zooming capability on the Galaxy S20 and Note 20 series. Some may like macro lenses, but it might seem like a placeholder excuse that enables OnePlus to say its phone has a third camera lens.

Either way, I've had a few days with the OnePlus 8T so far, and the overall experience has been excellent. Expect a full review soon.

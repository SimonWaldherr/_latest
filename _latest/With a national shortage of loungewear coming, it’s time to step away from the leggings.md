<div><p>John Lewis&#8217;s party season product edit was unveiled last week, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/brands/john-lewiss-2020-party-dressing-collection-has-lockdown-twist/">a &#8216;12 Days of Christmas Dressing&#8217; campaign,</a> which last year featured 10 glittery dresses and&#160;two sharply cut jumpsuits. This year&#8217;s version includes&#160;three loungewear outfits, and a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/brands/john-lewiss-2020-party-dressing-collection-has-lockdown-twist/">sequinned 'kitchen disco tracksuit'. </a></p>
<p>There are plenty of options for those who are not prepared to give up the elasticated comfort they have come to rely on, but who are equally determined to not succumb to a life in greige. You can buy dresses with smocked bodices, which stretch without looking slobbish. Wear them with knitted tights when it's freezing outside. Or try a smart jumper, with a pair of trousers that look like they&#8217;re tailored, but still have a stretch at the waistband.</p>
<p>The late Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld once said that: &#8220;sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants&#8221;. In this strangest of years, I&#8217;ll admit defeat. But is it really a look we want to carry over into 2021?</p>

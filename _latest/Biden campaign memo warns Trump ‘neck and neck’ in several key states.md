The Biden campaign released a memo warning that President Trump can “still win the race” and is “neck and neck” in several battleground states.

“Even the best polling can be wrong and that variables like turnout mean that in a number of critical swing states we are fundamentally tied,” Jen O’Malley Dillon wrote in a three-page message released on Saturday.

Dillon raised Trump’s surprising win over Hillary Clinton in 2016 even as polls showed the former first lady leading in the polls in the run up to the election.

“If we learned anything from 2016, it’s that we cannot underestimate Donald Trump or his ability to claw his way back into contention in the final days of a campaign, through whatever smears or underhanded tactics he has at his disposal,” she wrote.

Dillon urged Biden supporters not to “become complacent” because Trump can still win and “every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire.”

The race is closer than the polls indicate, she said.

The dire memo comes as Biden’s lead in the polls appears to be ebbing following The Post’s report from last Wednesday about the Democratic presidential candidate’s son Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine.

The IBD/TIPP pool, out on Saturday, found that Biden still leads the president 50 percent to 43 percent — but that support fell by 2 percentage points since Monday.

The survey also noted the possibility of “shy Trump” voters among Americans – much like the unexpected turnout in 2016.

On Saturday, the former vice president huddled with advisers at his home in Delaware as Trump held back-to-back rallies in the battleground states of Wisconsin and Michigan, states crucial to his win against Clinton.

The president raised The Post’s report about Hunter Biden during his visit to Michigan.

“Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. He makes Hillary Clinton look like amateur hour,” he said.

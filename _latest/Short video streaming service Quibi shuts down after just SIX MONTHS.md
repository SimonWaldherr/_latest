  Short video streaming service Quibi shuts down after just SIX MONTHS 
description: > 
  Quibi, the short video streaming service launched with great fanfare in April, is shutting down just six months later, according to multiple reports.Quibi founder and former Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg told investors in a call on Wednesday that the entertainment startup that raised $1.75 billion in capital is shutting itself down, the Wall Street Journal reported.The name 'Quibi' was an abbreviation of 'quick bites,' highlighting its video content designed to be viewed on-the-go from a mobile device.Targeted strongly at Millennials and Gen Z, Quibi hoped to position itself as a hip, mobile-first alternative to established streaming giants Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+.Seeking to attract more customers, Quibi increased its trial offer from two weeks to 90 days, while the subscription price - $5 per month with advertising or $8 without -- was comparable to the Disney+ service.

<p>&#8220;This year there were just more sharks around,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the question is why.&#8221;</p><p>Lowe sent fewer staff members to tag sharks this year because of social distancing and limited lab time and said he was amazed they found so many.</p><p>&#8220;Normally in our fall, when our water temperature gets to the low 60s, that seems to be a cue that drives them to migrate south to Baja,&#8221; Lowe said. &#8220;And so far, here we are mid-October, and the sharks are still sticking around. Maybe 2020 is going to be a year-round shark season.&#8221;</p></div>

It seems that Jon Courtenay's Britain's Got Talent win has come at the perfect time for him - as he admits to struggling financially during 2020.

The comedy singer, 47, won the show's whopping £250,000 prize fund on Saturday after beating off the nine other acts in the live final.

Prior to the COVID-19, he was a cruise ship singer - with the cruise industry majorly disadvantaged due to the pandemic's travel restrictions.

A sigh of relief: It seems that Jon Courtenay's Britain's Got Talent win has come at the perfect time for him - as he admits to struggling financially during 2020

On Sunday, he told The Sun: 'I haven’t worked since March. We have no savings. My wife has been a stay-at-home mum. This money has really got us out of a tough situation.'

Of what he'll be spending the money on, Jon said: 'Short of paying off our overdraft, I’ve got friends and family that I can help out. I’m also going to give a lot of money to needy children because I’ve got children.'

Had he not won, Jon said: 'I’d have had to get a normal job outside of the entertainment business as I wouldn’t have known where my next pay packet was coming from.'

Jon is married to wife Emma, 44, and shares with her two sons, Nathan, 15, and Alfie, nine.

He also said he'll be buying son Nathan the Millennium Falcon Star Wars Lego kit he's had his eye on - which retails at a whopping £649.99.

Following musical his Saturday night win, the BGT voting figures have been released, with Jon being revealed to have scooped 33.7 per cent of the public vote.

This smashed third and second place acts Steve Royle and Sign Along With Us out of the water, with Sign Along With Us receiving 15.33 per cent of the votes and Steve Royle garnering 14.1 per cent.

Next was fourth-placing Nabil Abdulrashid. The irreverent comedian received 13.9 per cent of the vote.

Some viewers weren't happy that Sign Along With Us didn't scoop the win, however.

The choir is fronted by leader Jade and her brother Christian who has a type of brain injury called HIE, caused by him being still born for 24 minutes. The choir sings as they use sign language.

One person took to Twitter to complain: 'I’m sorry but Jon Courtenay winning over Sign Along With Us is a tragedy. That money would have gone to all those BEAUTIFUL children & done SO much more than Jon who’s destined for holiday camps. I’m actually really upset about this... Terrible!' [sic]

'Sign Along With Us were the most heartwarming group from this year’s Britain’s Got Talent, I would have loved to have seen them win!' [sic] another wrote.

A third posted: 'I think that the poor mans Victoria Wood went on last so he would be fresh in everyone’s mind. Sign along with us should have won. They would have put the money to good use . He’ll spend it on holidays!' [sic]

When he was announced as the winner, Jon was left speechless, eventually saying: 'I've tried not to think about it because I'm really bad at hiding disappointment.

'A couple of mornings I've woken up - and actually this morning, for the first time - this sounds really dramatic - but I woke up and had an idea for a song for the Royal Variety Performance. I wrote it down and I tried not to think about it as a sign...' he said, referencing the prize of performing at the prestigious event.

He went on: 'Just amazing, I can't believe it. Listen, thank you. You don't know how much this means. You have changed my life, my family's life. My mum, I can't imagine how you're coping right now. I hope you're still alive!'

He added: 'Thank you, this has changed my life, my family's life. My mum - I can't imagine how you're coping right now, I hope you're still alive!'

Jon has not only bagged himself a slot at the coveted Royal Variety Performance but will also receive a whopping £250,000.

He was in fact that final act to perform on the show, singing a humourous-yet-poignant song reflecting on the year's events.

This left judge Alesha Dixon in tears, commenting afterwards that it was a 'perfect' way to sum up a year that everyone has found difficult.

BGT 2020 came to a close having battled through a year that has seen many shows, such as The X Factor and Love Island, sit production out entirely.

The series was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the spring, when it usually broadcasts auditions and the live finals prior to the summer. But ITV made sure it returned this autumn to complete the contest.

The judges (including Ashley sitting in for an injured Simon Cowell) have been sitting at a social distance for the finals, after the contestants patiently waited all summer long to complete the competition.

The audience was replaced with a virtual audience, allowing the arena atmosphere to be prominent in line with the strict COVID-19 rules that continue to be in place.

Viewers were also wowed by performances from the brilliant combined companies of Les Misérables – The Staged Concert, The Phantom Of The Opera and Mary Poppins.

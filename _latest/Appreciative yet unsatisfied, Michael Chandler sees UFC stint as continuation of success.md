<div><p>ABU DHABI &#8211; <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/michael-chandler">Michael Chandler</a>, one of the longtime faces of Bellator, tried on his UFC fight kit for the first time Tuesday.</p>
<p>The feeling wasn&#8217;t of relief or excitement &#8211; but rather conflicted emotions and dissatisfaction. Putting on the uniform is one thing. Walking the walk by proving your worth is another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today it was kind of an interesting feeling,&#8221; Chandler said at a UFC 254 pre-fight news conference. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t always looking forward to it like I was for sure going to be here, but I wondered what it was going to be like to put on the UFC fight kit. Here we are &#8211; and I&#8217;m not just satisfied with putting it on. I&#8217;m not going to be satisfied until I put that UFC gold around my waist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UFC generally viewed as the highest stomping ground in mixed martial arts &#8211; the pinnacle organization of the sport. But for Chandler, simply wearing a UFC logo doesn&#8217;t provide an added sense of accomplishment. An accomplished fighter and multiple-time Bellator lightweight champion, Chandler has accumulated numerous accolades over his 11-year professional MMA career.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an &#8216;I made it&#8217; (moment),&#8221; Chandler said. &#8220;That was one of the most frustrating things, and that&#8217;s not to say anything to downplay the UFC at all or me sitting here right now or what the men and women here at the UFC have done. This is the ultimate proving grounds for mixed martial arts. This is the biggest and most highly regarded, highest-ranking mixed martial arts platform on the planet. To be sitting right here is definitely an honor. I&#8217;m so not satisfied with putting on the gloves. I&#8217;m not satisfied with putting on the fight kit. Honestly, I&#8217;m not satisfied sitting here if I don&#8217;t get the fight. This was not my first choice.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Chandler, 34, would&#8217;ve preferred a more orthodox first UFC opportunity. Instead, he&#8217;ll weigh in Friday as a backup for the lightweight title fight between champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and Justin Gaethje.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not my No. 1 choice, but you make the best decision you can with the opportunities you have in front of you and the information that you have,&#8221; Chandler said. &#8220;Here we are, and I think I&#8217;m going to be UFC lightweight champion in the next 12 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Chandler, UFC fighter&#8221; is not a title that has sunk in quite yet. With all of the media opportunities and a dry-run of his first promotional fight week, Chandler is finally starting to approach a sense of normalcy as he slowly introduces himself to the UFC audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really won&#8217;t set in until the cage door closes &#8211; the octagon door closes and Bruce Buffer starts announcing my name,&#8221; Chandler said. &#8220;&#8230; If I come in here, whether I fight or not, this is a great dress rehearsal &#8211; a great dry run, rubbing elbows with all my new colleagues, all my new co-workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>First impressions are important, and whether he fights or simply weighs in, Chandler hopes his professionalism will gain the respect and admiration of unfamiliar UFC fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m introducing all the UFC fans to who Michael Chandler is,&#8221; Chandler said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never pulled out of a fight. I&#8217;ve never said no to a fight. I&#8217;ve never missed weight. I&#8217;m the perfect guy, especially in 2020, the year of all kinds of craziness. Have a backup fighter for the biggest lightweight fight possibly of the year, for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>UFC 254 takes place Saturday at Flash Forum on Yas Island, Abu Dhabi. The main card streams on pay-per-view after prelims on ESPN 2/ESPN+.</p>

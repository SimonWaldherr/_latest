  NASA prepares to touch down and take a rock sample from the asteroid Bennu TOMORROW 
description: > 
  NASA is preparing for touch down on asteroid Bennu tomorrow where it will take samples from the boulder-strewn space rock and bring them back to Earth by 2023.The space agency announced its OSIRIS-REx craft will touch down for a handful of seconds on asteroid Bennu following a carefully orchestrated 4.5 hour descent.OSIRIS-REx will touch down for a handful of seconds on asteroid Bennu following a carefully orchestrated 4.5 hour descent.NASA's OSIRIS-Rex mission will land on Bennu on October 20 to collect samples of the space rock.NASA images of asteroid Bennu reveal 'extremely bright' chunks of another asteroid on the surface NASA spotted pieces of asteroid Vesta ranging in size from five to 14 feet scattered across Bennu's southern hemisphere and near its center.

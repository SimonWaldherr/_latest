It’s finally here.

Amazon Prime Day has arrived. The annual two-day bargain bonanza starts at 12 a.m. PT on Tuesday and ends at 11:59 p.m. PT Wednesday.

The members-only discounts span tens of thousands of items from electronics to clothes to groceries. Big ticket items such as Smart TVs, headphones and baby gear will see steep markdowns, some for only a couple hours (the adrenaline-pumping flash sales).

If you’ve got a lot of items on your wish list (or, for overachievers, your holiday shopping list), it might be wise to take a personal day — there are more discounts available than the average person can comb through on a lunch break.

Here’s a look at the hottest deals that just dropped.

TVs

Televisions just keep getting smarter. Among the steepest discounts is the Toshiba 32-inch Fire TV Edition, which comes in the Amazon-brand Fire TV edition. It was $179.99, now it’s just $199.99.

<div><p>For the lucky few selected to experience "Full Self-Driving" (or FSD) on their Tesla vehicle, Tuesday night is the night.&#160;</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday afternoon that the <a href="https://me.mashable.com/tech/2773/teslas-full-self-driving-feature-is-back-on-autopilot">autonomous mode</a> was "happening tonight" after promising the feature would make it onto cars last week.</p>
<p>FSD has been a long time coming. It's been available as a future-ready option on the electric cars for a while, even if you couldn't actually use it.</p>
<p>Musk warned that the car's autonomous abilities will be "extremely slow &amp; cautious." Last week he explained that only "a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers" would get the update.&#160;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should.</p>

<p>Musk has been promising self-driving Teslas for years. He's previously said they'd be on the road by the end of 2019, but that obviously didn't happen.&#160;</p>

But it requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. There's also <a href="https://me.mashable.com/mobility/7233/tesla-owners-immediately-tested-the-new-smart-summon-in-parking-lots">Smart Summon</a>, which lets drivers use the Tesla app to drive over a car from a parking space.&#160;</p>

Media and advertising companies are increasingly going public via special-purpose acquisition companies as a way to get around the process of a traditional initial public offering.

While the process used to be viewed negatively by investors, the pandemic has changed that, and experts say SPACs can help ad and media companies that are building, or already have, strong recurring-revenue models.

Traditional investment is also getting harder for advertising and media companies to come by.

Experts say SPACs still have reputational challenges, though.

Special-purpose acquisition companies are the hottest area in investing.

SPACs, also referred to as "blank-check companies," are shell companies set up to raise money for the sole reason of acquiring companies. When a company merges with the shell, the publicly traded SPAC quietly takes a formerly private business public — avoiding some of the scrutiny, cost, and time involved in an initial public offering.

Some investors have looked askance at a company that goes public through the back door of a SPAC instead of going the traditional IPO route. Critics have also said SPACs lend themselves to companies that failed to find buyers.

But as the recession has changed how SPACs are viewed, a growing list of media and advertising companies are going public this way.

For example:

Playboy Enterprises is going public via a merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition, giving Playboy $100 million in cash toward growth plans.

The former Hearst executive Joanna Coles is leading a SPAC company called Northern Star Acquisition Corp. that is looking to raise $300 million and focus on beauty, digital media, wellness, fashion, subscription, e-commerce, and self-care businesses.

The streaming service CuriosityStream is merging with Software Acquisition Group, which will inject about $180 million in cash into CuriosityStream, including a $25 million private investment in public equity.

The adtech firm Digital Media Solutions merged with a SPAC, Leo Holdings, in July in a deal valued at $757 million.

A group of former Disney employees, Shaquille O'Neal, and one of Martin Luther King Jr.'s sons created a SPAC called Forest Road Acquisition Corp. with the goal of raising $250 million for deals like streaming platforms and intellectual property.

"The public markets have gotten harder to enter," said Corey Ferengul, who has led multiple advertising and media deals as a buyer and seller over the years and is a board member for several companies. "Media and adtech companies don't have easily definable recurring revenue like a SaaS company and are dealing with a very volatile market. There is so much unpredictability that it makes it hard for companies to go through the big spectacle and process of a public company."

Over the past few years, investors have significantly pulled back on advertising and media companies as they've lost billions in value. The landscape of mergers and acquisitions has also become more competitive with media and advertising companies as more of them focus on getting profitable before pursuing big acquisitions.

For that reason, David Steinberg, the CEO of the marketing-tech firm Zeta Global who has made a number of acquisitions, said SPACs were increasingly looking attractive to advertising and media companies as a way to raise funds. SPAC companies can also provide longer windows of financial guidance for investors.

"The advertising-technology space has been so decimated — you have to do a better job of explaining your business and getting investors on board," he said. "There used to be a negative connotation with SPACs; that's gone away."

SPACs can also avoid pricing difficulties that come about when two private companies merge, Ferengul said.

"If I'm a private company wanting to buy another private company, both companies have to agree on the value of both stocks," he said. "That's an art, not a science. When you're public, the market tells you the value."

According to John Hendricks, the founder and chairman of CuriosityStream, a SPAC favors companies with recurring revenue, an aspect that benefited his company, a streaming service that focuses on documentaries and features. CuriosityStream makes money from about 20 distribution partners and annual subscription plans from 13 million customers. Subscription packages range from $3 a month to $70 a year, and 80% of new subscribers opt for an annual subscription, Hendricks said.

"When we start the year, we have a significant portion of our revenue that's already booked," he said.

SPACs also open up more M&A for companies

Joe Marinucci, the CEO and cofounder of Digital Media Solutions, said the company merged with a SPAC as it considered acquiring more companies. The firm has already made 11 acquisitions, including the performance-marketing agency SmarterChaos in July.

SPACs have their limits

SPACs still face reputational challenges because they let companies skip the traditional IPO process, which could lead to a flood of companies going public through a backdoor.

"The risk is that less-than-exceptional companies might go public through a SPAC," said Jacob Donnelly, the managing director of digital revenue at CoinDesk and founder of the media newsletter A Media Operator. "It's unfair to say that if you go public via a SPAC that you're a bad business, but it's potentially easier than the traditional IPO route. When things are easier, less quality things happen."

And SPACs aren't necessarily a panacea for big digital-media companies like Vox Media, BuzzFeed, and Vice Media that have raised billions in venture-capital money but have been challenged to fulfill investors' expectations. They could go public via SPACs but would face challenges reaching the sky-high valuations they hit several years ago, as their growth has stalled and they've struggled to diversify their revenue beyond advertising, he said.

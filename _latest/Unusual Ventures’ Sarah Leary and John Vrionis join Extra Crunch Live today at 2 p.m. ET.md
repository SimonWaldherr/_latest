<div><p id="speakable-summary">Today at 2 p.m. ET/11 a.m. PT, Unusual Ventures&#8217; Sarah Leary and John Vrionis are joining us over at the Extra Crunch Live stage!</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unusual-ventures" target="_blank">Unusual Ventures </a> team has investments spanning the consumer and enterprise space, including Robinhood, AppDynamics, Mulesoft, Winnie and more. That short list could be the basis for a fascinating chat, but I also want to hear their thoughts on the democratization of venture capital, their appetite ahead of the election and the future of remote work. A big goal of mine is to squash some of the buzzwords we hear on tech Twitter so we can get an honest take on where one VC firm is sitting right now in a chaotic year.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/discuss-the-unbundling-of-early-stage-vc-with-unusual-ventures-sarah-leary-john-vrionis/">As we wrote last week</a>, this year has been everything but business as usual for the venture and tech community. And we still have an election ahead of us! I&#8217;ll ask Leary and Vrionis to share their framework for working through a looming event such as a presidential election and get their ideas on how early-stage is working more broadly.</p>

<div><p id="HTMMsT">As Vasiliy Lomachenko nears his Oct. 17 date to unify lightweight titles against Teofimo Lopez, <a href="https://www.ringtv.com/611545-vasiliy-lomachenko-doesnt-hold-back-on-teofimo-lopez-i-want-to-beat-him-very-badly/">Lomachenko explains to RingTV</a> just how badly he wants to shut up the rising star in the sport.</p>
<blockquote><p id="Y4N4w3">&#8220;I want to beat him very badly, very, very badly. I want to really beat him badly,&#8221; Lomachenko told The Ring in a recent interview. &#8220;(Lopez&#8217;s father) thinks (Lopez is) a big superstar like Tyson Fury. That&#8217;s why they do the trash talk. They act like they&#8217;re a big superstar, but they&#8217;re not.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p id="71tEMy">Lomachenko would continue by acknowledging that he has a genuine disdain for Lopez and his father, saying that all their trash talk about him has gotten him to a point where he wants to prove a point. </p>
<p id="y6zA8h">Top Rank promoter Bob Arum would double down on Lomachenko&#8217;s sentiment, saying that no one has really trash talked Lomachenko the way Lopez has and that it&#8217;s rubbed Lomachenko the wrong way. That said, Arum says Lomachenko&#8217;s training has been as intense as ever. </p>
<p id="4kduPJ">For Lopez&#8217;s part, he says he&#8217;s not intentionally trying to get under his skin, but if it&#8217;s had that effect then all the better. But for whatever either fight has to say about their opinion on the other, they&#8217;ll both have the opportunity to impose their physical will on one another this weekend on ESPN. </p>

<div><p>A Delta passenger wearing her mask incorrectly was kicked off a plane after punching a flight attendant in the face, video shows.</p>
<p>BBC journalist Suzanne Kianpour said the unidentified passenger got into a heated argument on the flight Monday evening to Atlanta from Miami.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/KianpourWorld/status/1318395019145990145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">footage reposted</a> by Kianpour, the raging traveler could be seen getting closer to the flight attendant before lunging forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in her face. Oh lord, oh lord&#8221; said a woman behind the camera before the passenger strikes the employee.</p>
<p>The woman watching the scene unfold then exclaimed, &#8220;You can&#8217;t be hitting a flight attendant!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another passenger, Lauryn England, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGjHzJxHExJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">captured another video</a> of the unruly passenger, who was wearing her mask around her neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have touched me. You pushed me,&#8221; the woman could be heard saying as a male travel companion stuck his finger in the employee&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>BBC reporter Katty Kay, who was also on the plane, said cops boarded the plane to remove them, but then another hold-up on the tarmac involving the passengers delayed the flight even longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delta handling this very responsibly,&#8221; she <a href="https://twitter.com/KattyKay_/status/1318371138527965185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Twitter</a>. &#8220;Why get on the plane in the first place if you&#8217;re going to refuse to follow the safety rules?&#8221;</p>
<p>Delta said in a statement that the passengers were booted off the plane for not complying with safety instructions.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade Police said no arrests have been made in connection to the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing more important than the safety of our people and customers,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why two customers who did not comply with crew safety instructions were asked to deplane Flight 1997 this evening [sic]. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not tolerate violence of any kind and this situation is currently under investigation. We apologize to customers for the flight delay this caused.&#8221;</p>

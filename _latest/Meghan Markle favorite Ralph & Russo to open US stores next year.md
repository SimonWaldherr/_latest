<div><p>Combining old-school glamour with modern swag, <a href="https://usd.ralphandrusso.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ralph &amp; Russo</a> reigns supreme. The British couture house dresses Hollywood royalty &#8212; as well as the tiara-wearing kind &#8212; for life&#8217;s biggest events, IRL or virtual.</p>
<p>Runway princess Hailey Bieber <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/14/hailey-baldwin-wore-three-wedding-dresses-to-marry-justin-bieber/?_ga=2.168938657.1423610077.1602691526-1237792657.1602691526" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">danced in its thigh-baring ivory silk slither</a> at her wedding reception last year. Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle<a href="https://pagesix.com/2017/12/21/see-prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-official-engagement-photos/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> wore the label&#8217;s black bespoke gown with a sheer beaded bodice</a> for her 2017 engagement photo shoot with Prince Harry. And to crown it all, Queen B (aka Beyonc&#233;) <a href="https://nypost.com/2013/08/01/beyonce-hits-it-out-of-the-park-in-her-home-stretch/?_ga=2.168961825.1423610077.1602691526-1237792657.1602691526" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened her 2013 &#8220;Mrs. Carter Show World Tour&#8221; in the brand&#8217;s pearl-studded bodysuit</a>.</p>
 
<p>In just 10 years, the maison has built a global business based on friendships with celebrities and flattering fairytale gowns. &#8220;It&#8217;s very encouraging to have achieved what we&#8217;ve done in such a short period of time, so we&#8217;re looking forward to the future,&#8221; co-founder and creative director Tamara Ralph tells Alexa over tea at her airy London atelier.</p>
<p>With a loyal American clientele &#8212; Kylie Jenner, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie are repeat customers &#8212; it was only a matter of time before R&amp;R expanded stateside. Next year will see the opening of a boutique in NYC, with Miami to follow.</p>
<p>Ralph, who earned a fashion degree at the Whitehouse Institute of Design in Melbourne, launched the label in 2010 with former banker Michael Russo, her business and then-romantic partner (the couple recently separated). In 2014, the house became the first British firm in almost a century to be accredited by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, and has shown on the official Paris couture calendar ever since.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;It was quite momentous at the time,&#8221; says Ralph, who like Russo is Australian. &#8220;We had a brand and a very big clientele base, but we hadn&#8217;t done a collection or shows before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each couture piece is handmade with the finest fabrics, fitted to a client&#8217;s measurements and often adorned with opulent embellishments like beading, embroidery and feathers. The custom dress that British singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding wore to last weekend&#8217;s digital Green Carpet Fashion Awards in London was festooned with more than 150 Zambian emeralds from Gemfields. Since the pandemic began, Ralph has been conducting e-fittings and, whenever possible, meeting with her billionaire customers one-on-one at a 19th-century townhouse in London&#8217;s Mayfair district (while following strict Covid protocol). A gleaming new workshop in London&#8217;s White City district operates with a very reduced and socially distanced staff, as most of her artisans have been working from home.</p>
<p>While Ralph says that couture remains &#8220;the heart and soul of the house,&#8221; it has now expanded into ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories, three categories that will be sold at the new stores.</p>
 
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/10/the-best-fashions-from-the-first-ever-digital-couture-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The spring 2021 digital ready-to-wear show</a>, unveiled on Oct. 2, was filmed on a set with live models but no audience. Called La Futura, the brilliantly colored line features lots of zig-zag, jungle and abstract tile prints, along with laser-cut leather pieces and double-satin cocktail dresses.</p>
<p>Ralph sent several new collabs down her virtual runway: a sunglass capsule with Linda Farrow (out in November); a co-designed La Perla beachwear and swimwear collection (the first drop hits stores in April); and a watch partnership with Audemars Piguet.</p>
<p>The designer says none of the success would be possible without the help of her creative family. &#8220;My grandmother was a couturi&#232;re, and she worked for several different designers over her lifetime. I used to create a lot of things in my bedroom, just for fun, and she would critique them, take them apart, check the quality and make me do them again if they weren&#8217;t correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was really integral to the development of the brand and my career,&#8221; continues Ralph. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m so happy that she was hard on me.&#8221;</p>

2. U.S. virus cases are climbing in 41 states, creating a third rise in the national curve. More than eight million Americans have been infected.

Seventeen states — mostly in the Midwest or in the Mountain West — are seeing surges unlike anything they experienced earlier in the pandemic. Many had relatively few cases until recently. These charts offer a snapshot of how this surge compares with the highs in April and July. Above, a field hospital in Milwaukee this week.

Europe is also grappling with an increase in infections: Weekly new cases have reached their highest point since the start of the pandemic, rising to seven million from six million in just 10 days, according to the World Health Organization. London will join other big cities in Europe, including Paris and Berlin, in tightening restrictions.

Americans are reeling from the most extraordinary set of crises to beset us since World War II: the pandemic that continues to affect every aspect of our lives, the extraordinary national angst and anger over the reckoning with racial injustice and inequality, and the massive dislocations of people in our economy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the racial injustice that infects our national institutions like nothing else in recent history. From racially motivated voter suppression laws at the state level, to police brutality and misconduct, to the persistent and corrosive legacy of discriminatory lending and hiring practices, inequality in all its forms has been laid bare.

We can and will overcome these challenges if we as a nation face them head-on with shared values and a commitment to helping each other in our role as fully committed citizens.

This year, we have proven how it can be done. America united in a truly memorable and wonderful moment behind the decisions to close schools, large portions of the economy and much of the interactions of daily life to defend ourselves against the assault by COVID-19.

As just one great example, the New York City area where I live has demonstrated how a large number of diverse people can come together behind the commitment to shelter in place, social distance and make life work in ways never before contemplated.

At the center of this response were shared values around the importance of defeating the enemy and protecting each other, especially the most vulnerable.

Education about democracy is vital

But we have overlooked a fundamental resource against the triple threats we face today and those that lie ahead: a new commitment to civics and democracy education at true scale across the nation.

Such a commitment will help us build an even better America by renewing our vows to each other to achieve a new level of genuine democracy and effective self-governance.

I serve on the Board of Counselors of Arizona State University’s School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership, which is focused on renewing American civics and democracy education. The school is working with a broad range of organizations to build a national campaign for improved U.S. history and civic education.

This includes a roadmap of options to educate and engage youth and adults in a deeper appreciation of our constitutional democracy — particularly the ways in which it has evolved over the centuries to extend and affirm basic rights and protections to women, African Americans and communities of color, and other historically marginalized citizens.

Reflecting a bipartisan commitment to restoring the foundations for informed public debate and civil disagreement, our Board of Counselors is led by Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl — two names not often seen together until joining forces for this project.

Survey after survey has demonstrated a stunning lack of knowledge of the nation’s crucial institutions or of the roles and responsibilities of citizenship. Few Americans can name their local, state or even national representatives who we select to carry out the daily work of our system of self-government.

America, we have a serious problem. One that goes to the heart of the many ways we are divided.

From my years as mayor of the extraordinarily diverse and boisterous good people of New Orleans; as president and CEO of the National Urban League, which has been committed to civil rights for more than 100 years; and my days as a legislator in Louisiana, I know that our political system is designed for constant debate.

But we have lost the tolerance for diverse views that is grounded in knowledge of America’s ideals, institutions and history.

Justice depends on rebuilding values

I also am convinced that one of the most powerful means of assuring genuine racial and social justice and equality lies in building a truly shared sense of American values and commitment to each other, to making our constitutional democracy work.

The national study on renewed history and civics education that the School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership is co-leading will propel efforts to engage directly with governors, state legislatures, state Departments of Education and a broad range of community organizations to revitalize a core mission of our public schools.

The school also is helping the Arizona Department of Education prepare for the first-ever Sandra Day O’Connor Civics Celebration Day in all of Arizona’s public schools this month. The school also has assembled an extraordinary array of free online content organized around these crucial themes.

This is our call to action: Find ways to help your family, schools, religious communities, clubs and organizations invest serious time in learning or re-learning the critical tenets of our constitutional democracy and informed citizenship.

Join in creating the biggest turnout in American history on Nov. 3 to demonstrate our shared commitment to self-government across the thousands of local, state and national elected positions.

Let’s make real in 21st century America that great phrase from Alexander Hamilton, when defending our new Constitution: “Here, sir, the people govern.”

Marc Morial is president and CEO of the National Urban League.

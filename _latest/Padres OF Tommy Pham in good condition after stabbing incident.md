San Diego Padres outfielder Tommy Pham is recovering from surgery after suffering a stab wound in his lower back on Sunday night.

The team said the stabbing cut through three layers of skin, but did not cause damage to any internal organs.

"While it was a very traumatic and eye-opening experience for me, I’m on the road to recovery and I know I’ll be back to my offseason training routine in no time,” Pham said in a statement released by the team.

The San Diego Union-Tribune cites two people who spoke to Pham as saying the incident occurred as the outfielder was leaving an establishment and walking back to his car. There, he found people arguing, and the stabbing occurred after he asked the people to get away from his car.

“We are aware of the incident last night involving Tommy Pham,” the Padres said in a statement. “He was treated at UC San Diego Health and is currently in good condition. He is expected to make a full recovery.

Pham, 32, just completed his first season with the Padres after playing the six previous seasons with the Tampa Bay Rays and St. Louis Cardinals. He hit .211 this year with three home runs, 12 RBI and six stolen bases in 31 games.

In the postseason, he hit .375 with one RBI and three stolen bases as the Padres defeated the Cardinals in the wild-card round, but were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL division series.

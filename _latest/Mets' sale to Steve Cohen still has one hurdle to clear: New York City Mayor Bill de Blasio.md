  Mets' sale to Steve Cohen still has one hurdle to clear: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio 
description: > 
  It’s New York City.While MLB owners are scheduled to vote Nov. 17 on whether to approve Cohen at their owners’ meetings in Dallas, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio could torpedo Cohen’s plans before it even reaches a vote.In the 2006 stadium lease agreement between the Mets and New York City, there’s a provision in which the mayor can prohibit the sale of the team to a “prohibited person,’’ since Citi Field is on New York City owned park land.The New York City Mayor’s office has a 30-day window, which was triggered last week, to complete their vetting process.MLB owners are scheduled to make the official decision in three weeks whether to welcome Cohen into their fraternity, but if New York City rejects the Cohen sale, the call will be made for them.

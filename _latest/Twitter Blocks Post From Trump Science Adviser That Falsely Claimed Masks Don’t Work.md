<div><p>(NEW YORK) &#8212; Twitter blocked a post Sunday from an adviser to President Donald Trump who suggested that masks do not work to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
                  <p>Scott Atlas, who joined the White House in August as a science adviser, had tweeted &#8220;Masks work? NO,&#8221; and said widespread use of masks is not supported.</p>
                  <p>The tweet violated a Twitter policy that prohibits sharing false or misleading misinformation about COVID-19 that could lead to harm, a company spokesperson said. The policy bans statements that have been confirmed to be false or misleading by experts such as public health authorities.</p>
                  <p>In such cases, Twitter disables the account until its owner deletes the post in question.</p>
                  <p>Trump has downplayed the importance of masks in reducing the spread of the virus, even after he contracted the disease, which has killed more than 215,000 Americans.</p>
                  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why the tweets were deleted,&#8221; Atlas said in an email, calling Twitter&#8217;s actions censorship. He said his tweet was intended to show that &#8220;general population masks and mask mandates do not work,&#8221; and he clarified that the correct policy is to use masks when one cannot socially distance. Atlas added that infections exploded even with mandates in Los Angeles County, Miami-Dade County, Hawaii, Alabama, the Philippines, Japan and other places.</p>
                  <p>Researchers have concluded that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/a87da6ce7831863152f0d904b9d1abe1" target="_blank">masks can control the spread</a> of the virus, and public health experts have urged the public to wear them. But Trump and his team often <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-fort-myers-media-florida-0a05d69faf3228057c7c95d188065a2d" target="_blank">go without masks while campaigning.</a></p>
                  <p>Atlas, the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center and a fellow at Stanford&#8217;s conservative Hoover Institution, has no expertise in public health or infectious diseases. He has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-health-politics-infectious-diseases-pandemics-886b59d445a3d20739e2f77600976ea0" target="_blank">criticized the coronavirus lockdowns</a> and campaigned for children to return to classrooms. Some scientists view Atlas as promoting dangerous theories around &#8220;herd immunity.&#8221;</p>

                  <p>Last week, Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-media-misinformation-social-media-elections-b7a4551572d3893ec0785df22c0f41a8" target="_blank">moved quickly to limit the spread</a> of an unverified political story published by the conservative-leaning New York Post. The story cited unverified emails from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden&#8217;s son, and it has not been confirmed by other publications. There have been no new tweets from the Post since Oct. 14, indicating Twitter may still be blocking the newspaper&#8217;s tweets.</p>

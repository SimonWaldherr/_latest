description: > 
  WASHINGTON – An independent government watchdog agency has agreed to investigate alleged political influence from the Trump administration over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.President Donald Trump and others in the administration have publicly contradicted health experts at both agencies on such issues, hurting the agencies' credibility."The CDC and FDA’s independence as scientific agencies is crucial to safeguarding the public health and saving lives.In early October, a House Oversight subcommittee also opened its own investigation into potential political interference around coronavirus messaging.Since the start of the pandemic, the CDC and FDA have been under fire for purportedly mixed messaging on social distancing, mask-wearing and reported COVID-19 statistics.

Twitter locked the Trump campaign’s account on Thursday for trying to share a video accusing Joe Biden of being a “liar” related to The Post’s report on Hunter Biden’s emails, according to the campaign’s social media manager.

From his own personal account, Mike Hahn tweeted a screenshot of the message from Twitter, reading, “Your account has been locked” and showing the post @TeamTrump tried to send to its 2.2 million followers on Wednesday afternoon.

“Joe Biden is a liar who has been ripping off our country for years,” the would-be tweet said, with an apparent link to a video.

Twitter accused the Trump campaign of “violating our rules against posting private information.”

“Twitter has suspended ⁦@TeamTrump⁩ for posting a video calling Joe Biden a liar who has been ripping off our country for years, as it relates to the ⁦@nypost⁩ article,” Hahn wrote. “19 days out from the election.”

The suspension comes the same day the social media platform blocked numerous accounts for tweeting links to The Post’s exclusive story, claiming it contained “hacked material.”

Facebook also moved to limit the spread of the story.

On Wednesday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted “our communication around our actions on the @nypost article was not great. And blocking URL sharing via tweet or DM with zero context as to why we’re blocking: unacceptable.”

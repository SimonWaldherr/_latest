Kingston, Woods and Big E came out and delivered an emotional promo about how they won't be a trio anymore after the draft split the group.

Cesaro, Sheamus and Shinsuke Nakamura gave a quick interview backstage about how they are looking forward to ruining The New Day's farewell match.

We returned from a break to see Woods and Nakamura already fighting in the ring. Kingston came in and hit a double stomp for a near-fall.

The next several minutes were a series of tags and double teams by the heel team. They kept Kingston isolated until he was able to break free and make the tag to Big E.

Cesaro was able to take the big man down but a tag to Woods allowed The New Day to hit a double team for a two-count. The next few minutes saw both team trade big moves back and forth.

Woods and E hit Midnight Hour for the pin and the win. They embraced in the middle of the ring to celebrate their win.

Grade: A-

Analysis

The promo before this match was a real and genuine as it gets in pro wrestling. These are three guys who were floundering when they formed a group six years ago and elevated each other to the top of the tag team division.

It's unlikely they will be apart forever but the emotion was still real as they talked about their love for each other. As far as the match that followed is concerned, it was a standard six-man bout designed to give The New Day a nice sendoff.

Cesaro, Sheamus and Nakamura are all great at what they do, so they were able to play the part of the heels who put the good guys over as well as anyone.

A lot of fans are upset WWE is breaking up the group but giving them one last match together was a nice gesture. Let's hope this leads to a lot of success for everyone involved.

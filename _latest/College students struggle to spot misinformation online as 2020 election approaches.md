  College students struggle to spot misinformation online as 2020 election approaches 
description: > 
  That's the message from Stanford University researchers who say their new research provides further evidence that college students are prone to being deceived online.The new study from the Stanford History Education Group shows that 2020's first-time voters often struggle to sort fact from fiction despite their technical prowess on smartphones and social media.The study adds to "a mountain of evidence that students struggle to evaluate the content that streams across their devices," said Joel Breakstone, director of the Stanford History Education Group and co-author of the study.The Stanford researchers advocated for incorporating lessons on source validation and basic fact-checking skills into regular coursework.Nadav Ziv, co-author of the study, said students are too trusting of the information they scroll through on their smartphones.

Nightingale hospitals in the North have been put on standby to take patients amid warnings that the UK's coronavirus death toll is set to rise.

It comes as health officials announced plans for the regular testing of healthcare staff, whether or not they have symptoms, in the worst-hit areas.

On Monday, Professor Jonathan Van Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said Covid infections were spreading across the country.

Nightingale hospitals in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate are now being prepared to accept patients.

Seven of the temporary hospitals were opened across the country during the first wave of the pandemic, but only the sites in Manchester and London were used. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said on Monday that the placing of the three sites on standby was "sobering but necessary".

It comes as health chiefs warned that four in 10 of all coronavirus cases are occurring in the North-West. They said that, unless infections are curbed, some hospitals could end up treating more patients than during the first peak within a month.

5 Stocks Under $49

Are you a HENRY? If you’re not sure, HENRY stands for High Earner, Not Rich Yet. It means that despite earning a six-figure income, you’re struggling to amass a meaningful nest egg.

Here at The Motley Fool, we’ve been providing investment guidance to help our members build the financial futures they’ve envisioned since 1993. In that time, our members have had the opportunity to access hundreds of generational investing recommendations, including top picks like AOL in 1994, Amazon in 1997, and Netflix in 2004.

Realizing you might be a HENRY? Remember the “not rich yet” part…

We believe you can do it, and we hope The Motley Fool can help.

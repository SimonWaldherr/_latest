"To be able to have a friend who changed my life and help me understand what greatness was about and what sacrifice was about, there's not many greater gifts," Pelinka said. "To be able to share this moment right now, knowing he and Gianna are looking down from heaven, and I know he's a proud friend."

The championship is the Lakers' first title since Kobe won one with the team in 2010. Throughout the season, many players on the Lakers voiced their motivation to claim the title in his name.

Following the game, Lakers superstar LeBron James said the death of Kobe brought the team "even closer."

"Our ball club, we got as close as you can possibly be when that moment happened... When you're internal and it hits home, it just means that much more," he said. "We locked in from that very moment and said, 'This is bigger than us. This is bigger than us.'"

"He was a big brother to all of us. We did this for him," he added.

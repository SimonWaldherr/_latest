More than 100 Hollywood stars and producers have signed a letter protesting NBC's decision to schedule a town hall with President Trump Thursday night, directly opposite Democratic candidate Joe Biden's town hall on ABC.

Stars including Ava DuVernay, Billy Porter, Amy Schumer, Julianne Moore and Seth Rogen – and NBC talent such as the cast of "This is Us" and "Law & Order: SVU" actress Mariska Hargitay – said they were "devastated" over the decision. The letter, sent to top NBC Universal executives and obtained by USA TODAY, was also signed by top producers including J.J. Abrams, Greg Berlanti, Damon Lindelof and Dan Fogelman, creator of "This is Us."

"This is not a partisan issue. This is about the political health of our democracy," the letter reads. "President Trump refused to participate in the virtual debate scheduled for Thursday night by the Presidential Debate Commission. By agreeing to air his town hall as counterprogramming opposite Vice President Biden’s town hall on ABC, you are enabling the President’s bad behavior while undercutting the Presidential Debate Commission and doing a disservice to the American public.

"We believe this kind of indifference to the norms and rules of our democracy are what have brought our country to this perilous state," it continues. "We are simply asking that NBC air the President’s town hall either before or after Vice President Biden’s so that American voters can have the opportunity to watch both."

In response, NBC says it understands the outcry, but claims its decision was motivated by equity, and the network signaled no plans to back down.

"We share in the frustration that our event will initially air alongside the first half of ABC’s broadcast with Vice President Biden," Cesar Conde, Chairman, NBCU News Group, said in a statement Thursday. "Our decision is motivated only by fairness, not business considerations."

Mentioning NBC's Biden town hall of last week, Conde continued: "If we were to move our town hall with President Trump to a later time slot we would be violating our commitment to offer both campaigns access to the same audience and the same forum. We hope voters will watch both discussions – ours will be available at any time, free and on-demand on YouTube, Peacock and all our digital news platforms."

The president and Biden were supposed to meet Thursday for their second debate hosted by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Following the president’s COVID-19 diagnosis, the commission switched it to a virtual meeting, but Trump declined to participate. Biden then agreed to appear on ABC.

Both town halls will begin at 8 EDT/5 PDT, but Biden will have the last word. The ABC event, moderated by George Stephanopoulos, will last 90 minutes with an additional half hour of analysis. Trump’s town hall on NBC is scheduled for an hour.

An unexpected star of President Trump’s Thursday night town hall event was a woman seated behind him in the audience — wearing a red mask and nodding along in agreement to most everything the president said.

The unidentified spectator could be seen on the left-hand side of Trump, seemingly praising the president as he sparred with NBC News’ Savannah Guthrie.

“I don’t know who the woman with the red mask is behind @realDonaldTrump but I’m becoming a huge fan of her agreement head shakes when the president answers questions,” tweeted former Navy SEAL and FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam.

The woman also gave a thumbs-up as Trump discussed the economy in his closing statement and loudly cheered while clapping over her head as the event concluded.

“I wish I had someone who believed me the way that woman with red mask believes Trump. We could all be so lucky,” one Twitter user wrote.

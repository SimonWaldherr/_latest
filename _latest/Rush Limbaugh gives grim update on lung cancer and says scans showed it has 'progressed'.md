I&#8217;m not there yet&#8230;It&#8217;s tough to realize that the days where I do not think I&#8217;m under a death sentence are over,' he added.&#160;</p><p class="vjs-video-container vjs-fixed vjs-span-two-col news" id="v-15910614267181050">    </p> <img id="i-64de34130d990b26" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="353" width="634" alt="American radio legend Rush Limbaugh gave a somber update on his lung cancer diagnosis&#160; on his show Monday saying he can no longer deny he&#191;s under a 'death sentence' and his cancer has shown signs of progression" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-64de34130d990b26" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/00/34591556-8857349-image-a-22_1603150440759.jpg" height="353" width="634" alt="American radio legend Rush Limbaugh gave a somber update on his lung cancer diagnosis&#160; on his show Monday saying he can no longer deny he&#191;s under a 'death sentence' and his cancer has shown signs of progression" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">American radio legend Rush Limbaugh gave a somber update on his lung cancer diagnosis&#160; on his show Monday saying he can no longer deny he&#8217;s under a 'death sentence' and his cancer has shown signs of progression</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We all know that we&#8217;re going to die at some point, but when you have a terminal disease diagnosis that has a time frame to it, then that puts a different psychological and even physical awareness to it,' he said.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Limbaugh said he had treatment earlier this month and was devastated when scans showed the cancer had progressed.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Now, prior to that, the scans had shown that we had rendered the cancer dormant.

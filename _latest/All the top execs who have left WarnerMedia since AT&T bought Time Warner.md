<p>After <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/att-acquires-time-warner-2018-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&amp;T bought Time Warner in 2018 for a massive $85 billion,</a> taking control of Time Warner's many assets including Warner Bros. and HBO, then-AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson sent a memo to employees.</p><p>"It's been a long time coming, but well worth the effort: AT&amp;T and Time Warner are now one company," <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/at-t-ceo-promises-creative-freedom-as-time-warner-deal-closes-1120433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephenson told employees</a> in the June memo.</p><p>But the acquisition, which formed the new WarnerMedia, brought with it a new set of complications. All of Time Warner's top executives were out less than a year after the deal finally closed after a months-long legal battle with the Justice Department, which sued AT&amp;T in November 2017 in an effort to block the merger.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hbo-ceo-richard-plepler-poised-to-step-down-2019-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise resignations like HBO's Richard Plepler</a> to a sex scandal that forced <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warner-bros-ceo-kevin-tsujihara-steps-down-after-scandal-2019-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara to resign</a>, Time Warner's leadership was completely remade.</p><p>And now WarnerMedia is undergoing another huge shakeup under new CEO Jason Kilar, who was named as the company's chief executive in April. He took over from John Stankey, who is now CEO of AT&amp;T after Stephenson exited the role. The restructuring also comes after the company launched its flagship product, the HBO Max streaming service, in May.</p><p>In August, WarnerMedia <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/business-insiders-biggest-advertising-and-media-stories-for-august-10-2020-8">announced the high-profile exits</a> of WarnerMedia Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt, HBO Max content chief Kevin Reilly, and head of corporate marketing Keith Cocozza.</p><p>The new Warner Bros. CEO, Ann Sarnoff, was put in charge of all film, TV, and streaming assets, while HBO's head of programming, Casey Bloys, will also oversee original content for Max.</p><p>"In looking at where we'd like to go and how the company was organized, we had two content organizations, and they both worked on HBO Max," Kilar told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-10/what-s-the-best-streaming-service-jason-kilar-wants-hbo-max-to-defeat-netflix">Bloomberg</a>. "The tough decision I made was to go from having two to one."</p>

Television Group chairman Peter Roth, who said on Friday he would step down early next year after more than 20 years. A successor has not been named, but Channing Dungey, who stepped down from her role as Netflix's VP of original content last week, is the top candidate, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-roth-to-step-down-as-warner-bros-tv-chief-11602871201">The Wall Street Journal.</a></p><p><strong>Here are major leadership changes that have happened at WarnerMedia:</strong></p>

The CAA said on Friday: “While [Heathrow] has raised important issues that result from the Covid-19 pandemic, we do not currently consider that [the airport] has demonstrated that its request is a proportionate response.”

A spokesman for Heathrow said: “We are disappointed with the CAA’s initial assessment and believe that it is not the right outcome for passengers. It risks further job losses at Heathrow and will make future improvements for passengers much more expensive. We intend to respond robustly to the CAA.”

IAG, the FTSE 100 owner of BA and Heathrow’s biggest customer, has previously criticised the current mechanism that allows the airport to bill carriers for costs it incurs.

A spokesman for IAG said: "We welcome the CAA's decision not to allow Heathrow to recharge its losses for this year and next onto airlines and their customers. We're staggered that Heathrow thought it appropriate to pass its Covid losses onto us.

“Heathrow is a wealthy, privately owned company which should seek funds from its shareholders as many other businesses in our industry have done to weather this pandemic. We look forward to participating in the CAA's consultation process."

The Supreme Court this week considered an appeal by Heathrow after the Court of Appeal blocked the building of a third runway on environmental grounds earlier this year.

A ruling is expected in the coming weeks.

Gatwick

Norwegian, which had been the third-biggest airline at Gatwick before the pandemic, will consult on plans to cut up to 259 jobs after deciding to close short-haul operations at the airport.

The airline, which is in talks with government officials over a state bailout in return for Oslo taking a stake, employs more than 1,100 pilots and cabin crew at Gatwick.

A spokesman for Norwegian said: “The Covid-19 pandemic continues to severely impact our business and this prolonged crisis is far from over. These unprecedented circumstances that we now find ourselves in require us to review the London Gatwick crew base in line with current business needs and the associated costs going forward.

“We have entered into consultation with our crew colleagues and unions based in the in UK and will look to find common solutions and mitigate redundancies.”

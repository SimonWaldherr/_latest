GCSEs and A-levels will be delayed by three weeks, the Education Secretary has confirmed.

Gavin Williamson said that contingency plans are being drawn up for students who are unable to take exams next summer due to illness, self-isolation or a local lockdown.

In a written ministerial statement, he said that exams will go ahead because they are the “fairest way of judging a student’s performance”, but added that they will be “underpinned by contingency measures”.

Downing Street officials are keen to avoid a repeat of this summer’s chaos, which saw a controversial algorithm ditched in favour of teachers' predicted grades following a national outcry.

The majority of exams will take place between June 7 and July 2, and results days will be pushed back to August 24 for A-levels and August 27 for GCSEs.

The Department for Education (DfE) said officials will announce additional measures to address “potential disruption” later this autumn.

“This could be a student unable to sit exams due to illness or self-isolation, or schools affected by a local outbreak during the examination season meaning centres cannot open,” they said.

One English and one Maths GCSE paper will be held before the May half-term, to ensure that students who may be in self-isolation or areas of local lockdown during June at least have the opportunity to sit part of the exam.

Mr Williamson said that no further changes to the content of courses will be made other than those announced by Ofqual, the exam regulator which include scrapping oral exams from French, German and Spanish GCSEs and axing parts of the history course.

Headteachers said they are "dismayed" by the announcement, adding that delaying exams by three weeks does not go far enough to compensate for the amount of school teenagers have missed during lockdown.

Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, said: “This step does not address the disparity between different student’s different levels of disruption to learning.

“Much more needs to be done to ensure that the qualification system takes account of this so that students can have confidence that the grades they are awarded in 2021 are fair.”

He welcomed the discussions around contingency planning but said it is frustrating that it has taken ministers so long to initiate this.

“Having started this discussion in July, it is disappointing it has taken this long to get to this point when there are so many more decisions to be made,” Mr Whiteman said.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are dismayed by this announcement. It has taken the government an eternity to reach a very inadequate response to the scale of the challenge which lies ahead for students who are taking GCSEs and A-levels next year.

“Delaying the start of exams by three weeks is of marginal benefit when compared to the loss of learning from the national lockdown and ongoing disruption. There isn’t enough being done to make the exams themselves fairer."

Mr Barton said the contingency planning for next summer's exams should have begun much earlier, adding: “The government has not moved quickly enough on this issue, and its response is so weak that it is inevitably storing up problems for the future.”

Last week the Scottish Government announced that National 5 exams – equivalent to GCSEs – will not go ahead next spring but Traditional Higher and Advanced Higher examinations - which are equivalent to AS and A levels - would take place as long as public health advice states that it is safe.

For next year’s National 5s, grades will be awarded based on two to four pieces of coursework per subject, to be marked by teachers.

In England, the vast majority of coursework for GCSEs and A-levels was axed under Michael Gove’s reforms, meaning that there is little formal assessment other than final exams.

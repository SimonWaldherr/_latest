The reigning Stanley Cup champions quickly made some moves as the free agency window opened Friday afternoon.

The Tampa Bay Lightning got their day started by placing center Tyler Johnson on waivers. Johnson, who recorded seven points (four goals, three assists) in 25 playoff games as the Lightning won the Stanley Cup this year, has a full no-trade clause, but that doesnâ€™t hold the Lightning back from placing him on waivers. Only a no-move-clause can prevent that.

The 30-year-old Johnson has been with the Lightning his entire NHL career, signing a three-year, entry-level deal in March 2011 after going undrafted. In 2019-20, Johnston posted 14 goals and 17 assists in 65 games.

Since 2012, Johnson has accumulated 153 goals and 186 assists in 534 games with Tampa Bay. He still has four years remaining on the seven-year, $35 million deal he signed in 2017 that carries a $5 million cap hit.

Additionally, left winger Pat Maroon and defenseman Luke Schenn both agreed to deals to return to Tampa Bay. Maroon, who collected 23 points in 64 games in 2019-20, reportedly signed a two-year deal with a $900,000 cap hit, according to TSN. Schenn reportedly agreed to a one-year contract at $800,000. The Lightning also added defenseman Andreas Borgman and former Islanders goalie Chris Gibson on one-year, two-way contracts.

TSN also reported Friday that the Lightning were actively working to move defenseman Braydon Coburn, who has one year left at $1.7 million on a deal that has a no-trade clause.

One player Tampa Bay did lose was defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk. He signed with the Ducks on a three-year, $11.7 million contract after winning the Cup with the Lightning. The 31-year-old signed the one-year, $1.75 million deal with Tampa Bay after the Rangers bought him out following a disappointing 2018-19 season when he registered just two goals and 26 assists in 73 games.

<p>He also tweeted: "Wearing masks, of all things, is the most obvious thing we can do to help decrease the spread of the virus and the smallest of all the sacrifices.</p> <p>"No brainer."</p> <p> Lineker had even posted a photo to his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page outside the same branch of Marks and Spencer in Barnes, south-west London, captioned: "I'm taking no chances." </p> <p>A fellow shopper who saw Lineker browsing without wearing a face covering on Sunday said: "It's just hypocrisy on another level.</p> <p class="html-embed-tweet"></p>   <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

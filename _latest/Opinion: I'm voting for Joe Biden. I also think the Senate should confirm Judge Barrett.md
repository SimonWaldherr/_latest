(CNN) The coming weeks may be brutal: The level of partisan rancor and performative outrage that we've seen over the timing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination may intensify during the confirmation hearings. And if that's the case, the hearings will be more than just terrible TV. They will underscore the fact that the American people -- and their senators -- are sorely lacking in basic civic knowledge. There may be protesters from the gallery shouting, for example, that Judge Barrett hates women's uteruses, and senators will likely be pandering to such unfounded criticism.

This melee of shouting extremes will crowd out nuanced positions, so let me offer one here: Joe Biden should be elected president, and Judge Barrett should be confirmed as a Supreme Court justice.

Young voters like myself are coming of age within a political culture teeming with binaries. We're constantly confronted with "either-or" choices, and we're told that our position on one issue should dictate our position on another. Nuanced judgments are discredited; passionate team players are celebrated. I'm tired of it. It doesn't have to be this way. We can think through distinct political questions and consider them separately on their own merits. We can be critical political thinkers, reaching positions that don't fit snugly into today's overly simplistic, binary politics.

One can be a principled supporter of both Biden and Barrett by accepting two important premises, one rooted in common sense, the other born of knowledge of our constitutional structure.

The US is a gigantic, immensely diverse nation comprised of millions of people of differing races, religions and worldviews. American democracy is not built on especially solid ground. Most other nations enjoy thick ties of shared ethnicity or religious views that hold the ship of state together even in the most difficult of times, while America is home to deep divisions along the lines of race, religion and worldview. Although our diversity is of course an immense source of strength, there are times when our differences push us into dangerous territory, as civic bonds fray under the duress of distrust and dislike. As summers like this last one and campaign seasons like the current one remind us, there are plenty of deep-seated prejudices, grievances and hatreds in our nation that can easily be exploited.

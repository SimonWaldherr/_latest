  Hong Kong Americans are voting for Trump — even though they don’t share most of his values

</p><p>Trump&#8217;s cold war with China has invigorated one unlikely group of voters: Hong Kong Americans.&#160;</p><p>Asian American voters generally <a rel="nofollow" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-asian-americans-are-thinking-about-the-2020-election/">lean Democratic</a>, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.aaldef.org/uploads/TheAsianAmericanVote2016-AALDEF.pdf">79 percent</a> voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016. But Matthew Li, a 44-year-old actuary living in Virginia, will be voting for a Republican president for the first time since arriving in the US over 20 years ago.</p><p></p><p>&#8220;Trump has been hard on China,&#8221; he explained to me. &#8220;He signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. He banned TikTok. He sanctioned Chinese government officials. His dedication to Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy transcends beyond words and into real action.&#8221;&#160;</p><p id="article-im-prompt"></p><p>For similar reasons, Bay Area tech worker Cyrus Cheung will be re-casting his vote for Trump, with even more surety than he did in 2016. &#8220;A weakened China means a more autonomous Hong Kong,&#8221; he explained. He does have misgivings about the president, from the mishandling of the pandemic to the absurd promises of a border wall. But ultimately, Cheung&#8217;s voter priority is foreign policy in the interests of his home city. It&#8217;s a belief shared by all the pro-Trump Hong Kong Americans I spoke to &#8212; no American president has ever forcefully stood up against Chinese hegemony.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Both Li and Cheung also cite the pro-Trump sentiment shared by some circles of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement as a major factor for their enthusiasm. In November 2019, protesters in Hong Kong <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-protesters-sing-star-spangled-banner-appeal-trump-liberate-n1051166">carried &#8220;Make America Great Again&#8221; signs</a> and posters that read &#8220;President Trump, please save Hong Kong&#8221; while singing &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner.&#8221; When Trump <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-coronavirus-china-defend-racist-attacks-chinese-americans-white-house-latest-death-toll-a9409636.html">referred</a> to Covid-19 as the &#8220;China Virus&#8221; in March, Hong Kong netizens reacted with &#8220;likes&#8221;, &#8220;haha&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;loves&#8221; on social media. The few remaining pro-democracy publications in Hong Kong, such as <i>The Apple Daily</i>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://hk.appledaily.com/opinion/20200902/ANJEGVJQZZB7XEQUSK7EQ5RZCQ/">endorse</a> the president&#8217;s re-election campaign.&#160;</p><p>These Trump supporters are worried that a Biden presidency may soften American anti-China rhetoric, allowing China to gain more power on the world stage. Li argued that the Obama administration displayed &#8220;all talk and no action&#8221; American resistance, allowing China to militarize the South China Sea with little consequence (despite China continuing these activities under the Trump administration.) Comparatively, he believes that Trump has successfully strong-armed China &#8212; its economy has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html">shrunk</a>, and unfavorable views of the country have reached <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/10/06/unfavorable-views-of-china-reach-historic-highs-in-many-countries/">historic highs</a> globally.&#160;</p><p id="taboola-carousel-thumbnails"></p><p>For the past four years, I&#8217;ve grappled with the complex combination of finding solidarity with my hometown&#8217;s struggles and existing as a young, female, minority immigrant in Trump&#8217;s America. It&#8217;s been jarring to scroll through my social media newsfeeds: old classmates&#8217; selfies of masked faces tagged with #chinavirus are juxtaposed with widely circulated shaky footage of yet another racist attack in the US. The optimistic na&#239;vet&#233; I had for America&#8217;s freewheeling opportunities when landing in LAX seven years ago has transformed into a weary wariness for racism, xenophobia, and sexism. Meanwhile, my hometown has become unrecognizable, with friends and family packing up their lives and moving to whatever country will welcome them.&#160;</p><p>My sense of displacement has been exacerbated by hearing these voters dismiss the ironic parallels between Trump&#8217;s America and Hong Kong under Beijing&#8217;s control. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/07/27/895713277/tear-gas-fired-on-protesters-again-during-overnight-protests-in-portland">images of tear gas</a> used on Black Lives Matter protesters were, to me, reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-china-police-tear-gas-china-security-law-a9530376.html">canisters smoking up</a> Hong Kong&#8217;s familiar neon backdrop. The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/super-tuesday-results-2020-primary-texas-voter-suppression-lines-long-wait-queues-a9373886.html">voter suppression efforts</a> ahead of the 2020 election reminded me of how Hong Kong officials <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-security/hong-kong-governments-election-delay-may-be-unlawful-bar-association-idUSKBN24Z078">delayed the Legislative Council election</a> by a year, citing Covid-19 concerns. Both places are waging war on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/dan-rather-interview-trump-press-freedom-fake-news-journalism-60-minutes-cbs-b811406.html">press freedom</a>.&#160;</p><p>When speaking to these voters, it was clear to me that they recognized these contradictions. In fact, Li will be voting blue down the ballot &#8212; &#8220;I buy the Democratic Party&#8217;s values more,&#8221; he told me &#8212; despite Republican senators such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-sanctions-cruz-rubio-retaliation-hong-kong/2020/08/10/f8e221a4-dae2-11ea-b4f1-25b762cdbbf4_story.html">actively championing</a> the Hong Kong pro-democracy cause. But it is desperation and fear, stemming from a mistrust of Biden&#8217;s record, that is driving their selective dismissiveness and ignorance of Trump&#8217;s authoritarian tendencies.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Trump is our last chance,&#8221; Cheung said.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;But do you really think Trump cares about Hong Kong?&#8221; I asked.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied without hesitation. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a Cantonese phrase that&#8217;s defined the Hong Kong protests &#8212; <i>laam chau</i>: we burn, you burn with us. I know he&#8217;s not concerned about human rights. But as long as he takes real action against China, I don&#8217;t care if Hong Kong is just a pawn in the trade war.&#8221;</p><p></p><p>Given the futility of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, I understand Hong Kong Americans&#8217; desire for any challenger to Xi's regime. But ultimately, China has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/hong-kong-national-security-law-10-things-you-need-to-know/">enacted</a> Hong Kong&#8217;s national security law criminalizing protests, seditious speech, and calls for the city&#8217;s autonomy &#8212; all under Trump&#8217;s watch. With Trump's America being far from an emblem of democratic freedom, it is dangerous to hope that he can be Hong Kong&#8217;s savior.&#160;</p><p class="sc-ptCms fzKffT"></p></div>

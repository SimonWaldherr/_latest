<div><p>J Crew&#8217;s stores only offer a small percentage of it stock. The website on the other hand has the full array as well as a great permanent sale section (NB always filter by size first!). The imagery on the site is great for a bit of uplifting, all-American cheer. Note, returns are not free, nor straightforward but have been extended to 60 days.</p>
 
<p>Achingly cool Joan the Store digitally embodies the spirit of East London. The gritty imagery offsets the sometimes kitsch selection of pieces and a tight, concise edit means there isn't masses to trawl through. Come here for offbeat but beautiful investment purchases</p>
 
<p>One of the pioneers in &#8216;direct to consumer&#8217; digital shopping, Kitri has swiftly become a secret weapon for the fashion world. It offers great&#160;dresses, limited runs of products and new drops every week. Free 2-3 day delivery and free returns are available on orders over &#163;45, because &#8220;life is stressful enough&#8221;.</p>
 
<p>With a very clear aesthetic - grown-up bohemian, but not too &#8216;incense sticks&#8217; - KJ&#8217;s Laundry can be a Marmite store. We love it. With a mix of hard to come by brands, its own label and a large selection of the enormously popular Samantha Sung shirt dresses, if this is your bag, you&#8217;ll be adding everything to basket.</p>

Even if you&#8217;re not in need of anything, it's worth checking out as the edit&#160;is sure to bring a smile to your face.

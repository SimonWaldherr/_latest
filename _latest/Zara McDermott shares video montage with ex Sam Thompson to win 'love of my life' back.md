A source told MailOnline: 'Zara cheated on Sam with someone in the music industry. Someone connected to the X Factor.

'Sam is obviously distraught about this. He only found out about it very recently and has escaped for a few days.

'Zara regrets it and feels terrible. She knows it was a huge mistake and is extremely upset.'

During their relationship, Zara joined Sam on his E4 show Made In Chelsea as a cast member.

On the show, she was seen declaring that she wants to marry and have children with Sam. She also moved in with him at the start of lockdown.

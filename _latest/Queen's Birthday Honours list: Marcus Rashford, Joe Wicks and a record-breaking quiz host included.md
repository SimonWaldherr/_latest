Mr Flynn had been running a pub with a business partner until March. He ran the quiz nights there, switching to the virtual event on Facebook when the shutdown came in. He said: "I did not realise at the time that the setting was to 'public', and by the time of the first quiz on March 26 we had half a million people interested.

"I think it was because in those first few days everybody didn't know what they were doing or supposed to be doing. We didn't have anything to look forward to. That Monday night when Boris said, that's it, lockdown – what do we do now with our lives?

"I think the reason it captured my friends' imagination was everybody had something to look forward to. It's a great, really, positive community – everybody is really friendly. I'm proud to know we played our part."

One edition of the quiz in May, hosted by Stephen Fry, raised £140,000 for Alzheimer's Research UK, with total charity donations now at £750,000. The event holds the Guinness World Record for the most viewers of a quiz YouTube live stream, with more than 182,000 people playing.

It has also raised money for homeless charities, an issue close to Mr Flynn's heart. Originally from Roehampton, south-west London, he found himself homeless and living on Victoria Embankment for two years after a relationship breakdown in mid-2007.

A rough sleeper team from St Martin-in-the-Fields church, in central London, helped find him temporary accommodation and get him back on his feet. "They just rebuilt me from a shell," he said. "I don't forget, ever."

Felicia Kwaku, associate director of nursing

A nursing leader who witnessed her colleagues dying from Covid-19 has dedicated her OBE to NHS staff who "laid down their lives" during the pandemic.

Felicia Kwaku, 52, associate director of nursing at Kings College NHS Foundation Trust, was honoured for her services to nursing spanning more than 30 years.

At the height of the pandemic, she supported BAME nurses by delivering webinars that reached thousands of NHS staff at a time when they felt vulnerable and scared.

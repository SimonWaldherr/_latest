<div><p>Can City Hall get anything done on time?</p>
<p>While Mayor Bill de Blasio has enough time on his hands to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/22/de-blasio-walks-off-for-strolls-as-city-struggles-to-get-by/">go on daily walkabouts</a>, his administration is blowing deadline after deadline when it comes to providing the City Council with legally mandated reports about the shape and function of municipal government.</p>
<p>The slew of late reports runs the gamut from the Health Department&#8217;s examination of maternal mortality rates, the city&#8217;s plan to combat homelessness and even the first progress report for Hizzoner&#8217;s much-ballyhooed &#8216;Green New Deal,&#8217; local news website <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/10/21/21527867/key-nyc-stats-missing-after-blown-reporting-deadlines-with-covid-to-blame" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The City reported Thursday.</a></p>
<p>That report was published the same day The Post revealed that Hizzoner has been taking daily, mid-morning and midday sojourns to wander around South Street Seaport and his old Park Slope, Brooklyn neighborhood during work hours.</p>

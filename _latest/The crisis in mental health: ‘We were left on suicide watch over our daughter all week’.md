Mental health was already under pressure, but Covid-19 and its resulting shutdown of services have been devastating for patients, with experts warning the consequences will be felt for years to come.

Despite a surge in demand – with rates of depression doubling this year, according to the Office for National Statistics – services have been shut down, pared back and moved online. Last week, the Royal College of Psychiatrists warned of a “looming” mental health crisis, with two fifths of sufferers only getting help in an emergency and more than one in 10 patients waiting six months or more for help.

The outlook is especially worrying for children and young people. The number of under-18s referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in England nearly halved in the first two months of lockdown, according to recent freedom of information requests.

“The pandemic is likely to have exacerbated many of the problems we were already seeing around access to services,” says Whitney Crenna-Jennings, senior researcher at the Education Policy Institute.

Sarah has been battling for help for her 15-year-old daughter, Anna, who was badly affected by lockdown, and attempted to take her life in July.

She and her husband rushed Anna straight to A&E and managed to get an appointment with the CAMHS crisis team in the hospital. They were given a meeting with a nurse a week later. “My husband and I were left, on suicide watch all week,” she says – and then Anna was offered group therapy, via Zoom, starting in another two months’ time.

Sarah kept calling CAHMS. “I told them Anna had deteriorated so much she couldn’t shower, couldn’t brush her teeth and barely left her room. She was crying and telling us she wanted to end her life; it was hideous.” After another call, the nurse told Hannah she didn’t believe Anna was really suicidal, and there were no other services they could offer her.

Sarah felt she had no choice but to book an appointment with a private psychiatrist and therapist, at a running cost of nearly £3,000. “I know we’re fortunate to be able to do that,” she says, “and I feel desperately sorry for the families who can’t, because I believe in the NHS and that it should be there for everyone.”

The private psychiatrist has prescribed medication “that’s made the world of difference” and the therapy has helped. The group therapy promised by CAMHS still hasn’t materialised. “We’re still waiting, three months on,” Sarah says. “There hasn’t been another phone call to see how Anna is – they don’t know that we’ve gone private. I feel that we’ve been dismissed to the point of negligence.”

Hannah’s 17-year-old daughter, who has autism and OCD, was being treated on an adolescent mental health unit in north Wales when the lockdown came into force. She had been doing well but Hannah says her mental state deteriorated dramatically when family visits were stopped as part of measures to reduce the spread of Covid.

“My daughter was very family orientated before, and she’s never been away from home before. But for eight weeks we couldn’t see her, which was devastating,” says Penelope. Within two weeks, Penelope stopped eating food and started having terrible hallucinations. Hannah and her husband begged the unit to medicate their daughter against her will and feed her via a tube if necessary, but the unit said they needed an outside second opinion, which they couldn’t get “because of Covid”. Desperate, Hannah dropped off sachets of hot chocolate and fruit juice from home, which Penelope would eat. Ultimately, her daughter ended up in A&E with malnutrition and severe dehydration. “The hospital was shocked it had been allowed to go on for so long.”

When visits were resumed, only one member of the household was allowed in (“which is nonsensical,” Hannah says, “we all live in the same house and share the same germs”), and even now, Hannah has to maintain a 2m distance from her daughter. “I haven’t been allowed to hug my child, who is severely ill, for months. It’s torture.”

Penelope now has full-blown psychosis disorder that could affect her for the rest of her life, and has likely developed an eating disorder. “When you find out that your child is no safer in this unit than they are with you, but there’s nothing you can do about it because you’ve signed a section, it’s devastating,” Hannah says.

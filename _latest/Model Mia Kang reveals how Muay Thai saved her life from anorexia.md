<div><p>Weak with hunger and weighing just 98 pounds, frail model <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/03/25/this-si-model-is-also-a-trader-and-a-pro-fighter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mia Kang</a> collapsed into the arms of a stranger after a pervert followed her through the streets of Milan.</p>
<p>The creep, who had been pleasuring himself during the pursuit, backed off when the good Samaritan yelled at him in Italian. But the 2006 incident left Kang a wreck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wanted to go home, lock the door, get in bed and stay there,&#8221; recalls the 5-foot-9 Sports Illustrated beauty in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knockout-Mia-Kang/dp/1419743325/?tag=nypost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">her memoir &#8220;Knockout&#8221;</a> (Abrams Books, out Oct. 20).</p>
<p>Fourteen years later, if the same thing happened, the sex pest might well be sipping his food through a straw. A much healthier Kang is a force to be reckoned with now that she combines modeling with professional Thai fighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t advise charging at a man who is trying to come after you, but I would be far more confrontational,&#8221; the 31-year-old told The Post. &#8220;I don&#8217;t take s&#8211;t and I am not intimidated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I walk around with a confidence that makes me feel like a different person.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>In fact, recovering anorexic Kang credits Muay Thai with saving her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without it, I think I would have spiraled further down into my eating disorders and depression,&#8221; said the Hong Kong-born Manhattan resident, who was bullied for being overweight as a child. &#8220;It opened a door for me and threw me a lifeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kang discovered the sport in 2016 &#8212; the same year she won the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model search contest &#8212; at a time when she was starving herself to fit into size 2 clothes for high-profile fashion clients.</p>
<p>A succession of liquid-only diets plus the misuse of laxatives, diuretics and cigarettes took a toll on her mind and body. In her book, she admits to &#8220;suicidal thoughts,&#8221; wondering whether killing herself was the only escape from the &#8220;vicious cycle&#8221; of restricting and bingeing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, a 10-day vacation in Thailand altered Kang&#8217;s trajectory. She was intrigued after watching a group of Muay Thai fighters in action. She tried it for herself, leading her to stay on Koh Samui for six months working out at a no-frills gym on the island.</p>
<p>&#8220;How you look when you are training is the last thing on anybody&#8217;s mind,&#8221; said Kang, who was desperate for a break from her appearance-led industry. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about skill and knowledge. You check your ego at the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another bonus: She found it impossible to find the strength to fight without changing her destructive eating habits. Her weight stabilized after she ate &#8220;balanced meals&#8221; that were &#8220;in accordance to the physical activity I was doing every day.&#8221; As a result, she grew into a more sustainable size 4 to 6.</p>
 
<p>Explaining the lure of fighting, Kang added: &#8220;When I&#8217;m modeling, I feel like I am treated so preciously and delicately. People say: &#8216;Just sit in the chair and nobody touch her.&#8217; With martial arts, it&#8217;s the complete opposite as you go through the journey of getting beaten up and then picking yourself back up again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the bigwigs at Kang&#8217;s modeling agency found it difficult to accept her newfound obsession with Muay Thai. Kang&#8217;s face was her fortune, and the risk of injury was high.</p>
<p>However, in May 2017, they allowed her to compete professionally in the ring against experienced Thai fighter Nong B. Despite a pounding, during which she suffered a deep cut under her eye, the model emerged victorious.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t work for about three to four weeks, but I factored that into my scheduling when I took the fight,&#8221; Kang said. &#8220;I was mentally prepared for more serious injuries like a broken limb or concussion, so I was quite pleased with my post-fight condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed out that, since modeling is generally such a short-lived career, she feels she shouldn&#8217;t ever turn down jobs in favor of martial arts. But she added, &#8220;A massive part of my heart wants to be in the ring. It&#8217;s tough!&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as the mentality of a fighter is concerned, Kang said that the inclination to survive at all costs is &#8220;primal.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Instinct kicks in, because [the opponent] is really trying to take your head off and there is this realization of: &#8216;OK, she&#8217;s trying to kill me. I need to kill her,&#8217;&#8201;&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Now a size 8 to 10 and weighing around 170 pounds, the singleton is temporarily living on Phuket and training in a jujitsu program. Her Muay Thai career and modeling assignments are on hold because of COVID-19 and the resulting worldwide travel bans.</p>
<p>Yet Kang remains optimistic about a future she once feared she might not see. &#8220;There were times in the midst of my eating disorders when I thought, &#8216;This is how life is going to be, and it&#8217;s exhausting.&#8217; But it&#8217;s no longer this all-consuming thing,&#8221; she said.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so lucky to still be modeling at the age of 31 while practicing martial arts. I want everybody to know there is light at the end of the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharing hope with others was her key motivation for writing her book. She chose to publish it this fall as the body-positivity movement grows and her social-media reach is far, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miakang/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with 296,000 followers on Instagram.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;There is no better feeling than being a strong and confident woman at any size,&#8221; Kang writes. &#8220;I want to help other women access their inner badass.&#8221;</p>

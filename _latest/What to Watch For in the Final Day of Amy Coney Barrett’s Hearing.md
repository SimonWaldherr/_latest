After two days of grilling by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett will not appear on Thursday, as the panel debates approving her nomination and two panels of witnesses testify for and against it.

The session will begin with senators taking turns stating their views of Judge Barrett and a move by Republicans to advance her nomination to the full chamber. By committee rules, Democrats may request that the vote be delayed a week, and they are expected to do so. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the panel’s chairman, has said he will honor the request in line with the committee’s custom.

That would put the committee’s vote to approve Judge Barrett’s nomination on Oct. 22. A vote on confirmation by the full Senate is expected the following week, as early as Oct. 26.

The session’s focus on Thursday then will shift to a series of speakers who will share their perspectives about confirming Judge Barrett for the Supreme Court seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until her death last month.

Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris landed the cover of Elle magazine’s November issue, discussing what “justice” means to her as a former prosecutor.

The interview kicks off with the US senator recalling how her fight for civil rights began as a baby, when her parents took her to a civil rights march in Oakland.

“My mother tells the story about how I’m fussing and she’s like, ‘Baby, what do you want? What do you need?’” she said. “And I just looked at her and I said, ‘Fweedom.’”

Harris’ views on justice is the theme that runs throughout the piece, which hits newsstands on Nov. 3, with journalist Ashley C. Ford asking what that means to the former long-serving San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general.

“It’s about freedom, it’s about equality, it’s about dignity,” Harris responded. “When you achieve equality, and freedom, and fairness, it’s not because I grant it to you. It’s because you fought for it because it is your right.

“This is not about benevolence or charity; it is about every human being’s God-given right. What do we collectively do to fight for that? That’s what justice represents to me — it’s about empowerment of the people.”

Harris, the first black and Indian American woman to accept the Democratic nomination for vice president, went on to explain that she was raised to learn that justice “is not about charity and benevolence, it’s about your duty.

“No one’s going to congratulate you for it — it’s what you’re supposed to do,” she said.

Harris, 55, whose parents are Indian and Jamaican immigrants, also recalled how she was expected to fight for what she believed in at home.

“If you sit at the dining table and you want to say something, you’d better be prepared to defend it, no matter how old or young you are,” the senator said.

Harris’ cover was unveiled Tuesday, the day before she was set to hit the debate stage with Vice President Mike Pence.

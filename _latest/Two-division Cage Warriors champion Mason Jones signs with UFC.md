<div><p id="5RGwwy">The UFC has added another Cage Warriors champion to the roster after Mason Jones announced that he&#8217;s inked a four-fight deal with the promotion.</p>
<p id="8UpBhc">Jones confirmed the news in a post on his Instagram account.</p>
<p id="G1yx7S">&#8220;Friday October 9th I signed a 4-fight contract with UFC, the biggest &amp; best MMA organization in the world,&#8221; Jones wrote. &#8220;The moment when my dream became a reality.&#8221;</p>
<p id="rnD3DW">Undefeated through the first 10 fights of his career, Jones recently became a two-division champion in Cage Warriors when he claimed the vacant welterweight title with a first round knockout against Adam Proctor.</p>
<p id="MfYuL1">That fight came after Jones won the lightweight title with another first-round knockout against Joe McColgan.</p>
<p id="ZOh65E">It&#8217;s unclear at this time which weight class Jones will focus on now that he&#8217;s in the UFC but obviously he has experience competing at both 155 pounds and 170 pounds.</p>
<p id="urYlQu">Jones joins a long line of former Cage Warriors standouts to join the UFC roster, none more famous than <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1859/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a>, who was also a two-division champion when he fought for the European promotion.</p>

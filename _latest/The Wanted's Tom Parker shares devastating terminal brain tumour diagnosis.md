The Wanted star Tom Parker has shared the devastating news that he's been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.

The dad-of-one, 32, says his tumour is inoperable.

He told OK! Magazine : "I’m still in complete shock, it’s so much to take in."

His wife Kelsey, with whom he shares 16-month-old daughter Aurelia, added: "It has been a crazy six weeks. We had an inkling that something was wrong in July, but we never could have imagined it was this."

Tom, who said his diagnosis didn't feel real, added: "I knew something wasn’t right, but I never expected it to be this. You never think this will happen to you."

Tom, who is expecting his second child with Kelsey, took to Instagram this morning to share the tragic news with his fans.

Sharing a sweet snap of himself with his wife and young daughter, he penned: "Hey guys, you know that we’ve both been quiet on social media for a few weeks and it’s time to tell you why.

"There’s no easy way to say this but I’ve sadly been diagnosed with a Brain Tumour and I’m already undergoing treatment. We decided, after a lot of thought, that rather than hiding away and trying to keep it a secret, we would do one interview where we could lay out all the details and let everyone know the facts in our own way.

"We are all absolutely devastated but we are gonna fight this all the way. We don’t want your sadness, we just want love and positivity and together we will raise awareness of this terrible disease and look for all available treatment options. It’s gonna be a tough battle but with everyone’s love and support we are going to beat this. Tom and Kelsey xxx"

He was inundated with support.

James 'Arg' Argent told him: "We love you Tom! We got this brother, No doubt about it!"

Rebecca Adlington commented: "Sending so much love and support always xxx"

Tom's fans also rushed to tell him how strong he is and how confident they are that he can beat the tumour.

Tom had last posted on Instagram in August, but his absence now makes sense to his devastated fans.

The singer tied the knot with Kelsey in 2018, when they said 'I do' in a romantic ceremony at Ridge Farm, in Surrey.

His fellow boyband members Jay McGuinness and Max George acted as his ushers.

Tom and Kelsey welcomed their first child, daughter Aurelia, 16 months ago.

They announced in May that they were expecting their second baby together.

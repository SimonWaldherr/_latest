Most of the problems arose in Michigan, although Wisconsin, Ohio and Florida each had at least one late arrival as well.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Eight of the shipments took a week or more to get to their cross-town destinations, including one letter that still has not arrived, according to the post office&#8217;s online tracking system. The missing letter was put in the mail two weeks ago, on Oct. 6.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="USA TODAY"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Although the mailings were too small in number to determine whether widespread delays are occurring, the erratic results make it hard to know whether or not your ballot will arrive at the elections office by the legal deadline. Millions of people <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/26/biden-supporters-in-states-where-it-is-hardest-to-vote-by-mail-are-most-concerned-about-voting-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">are expected to vote</a> by mail this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and most are registered Democrats.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said her office has spent all year preparing for contingency plans, including a slowdown in mail. The office has installed more than 1,000 drop boxes across the state&#160;and set up 21 new satellite offices for election needs in Detroit alone.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-investigations-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That massive intake apparatus&#160;"enables us to, today, two weeks out, recommend that people not use the mail," she said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Responding to USA TODAY's findings, Benson&#160;said the delays "will certainly have an impact on our residents. Sometimes people only get mail two days a week. The impact of the slowdown extends far beyond the election. That's very real."</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Linda Weltner and Sandra Winter came dressed as a USPS mailbox during a rally outside the Marblehead Post Office to support the post office and to protect the mail-in balloting process on Saturday, Aug. 22, 2020."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The news organization's results show at least some of the operational problems that arose with last summer&#8217;s appointment of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy -- and his cost-cutting measures -- have persisted into the fall. DeJoy ordered the dismantling and deactivation of mail sorting machines, barred overtime and required carriers and trucks to start routes at certain times, regardless of whether the mail was ready, resulting in widespread slowdowns.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-investigations-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The effort provides real examples of problems that more exhaustive datasets have indicated could occur. For example, quarterly on-time reports produced by the postal service show that the Detroit area has had one of the highest rates of late mail in the country, with 34% of mail delivered late.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">USA TODAY found just&#160;how long the delay&#160;can be&#160;for letters that get misplaced or mishandled. Even if a tiny percent of ballots were to get set back by a week or two, it could translate to thousands of discounted ballots.&#160;</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Roundabout journeys</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Certified mail carries a bar code and a tracking number that allows customers to check online each time and location where postal employees scanned it into government computers and logged its status.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="One of the GPS units, a Logistimatics Micro 299 Mini GPS Tracker. USA Today Network reporters, in partnership with the University of Maryland's Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, have mailed the units in swing states across the country to measure mail efficiency and track its path."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In 38 of the letters mailed by the news network, reporters inserted GPS tracking devices in bubble-wrapped manila envelopes to paint a more detailed portrait of why delays occurred.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On Sept. 21, a reporter mailed a GPS unit from a post office in Bradenton to a destination across town, just six miles northeast.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But GPS readings show the envelope went due north, 43 miles, to Tampa, where it stopped for the day.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">From there, it traveled east, more than a third of the way across the state, to Lakeland.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Over the next five days, it went to Sebring, back to Lakeland, again to Tampa, then back to Bradenton. The package arrived at its destination on the Manatee River Sept. 28.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The next week, the reporter sent the GPS unit from the same location, addressed to the same recipient.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It made that trip in just one day.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="One package, mailed from Bradenton, went far afield in its journey across town, records from a GPS tracker inside the envelope show.

She said the agency will give extra attention to what they can tell is election mail.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The extra attention will include expedited handling, extra deliveries and special pickups for mail that can be identified as a ballot, she said. Still, she suggested voters get their ballots in early.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Our general recommendation is that, as a common-sense measure, please mail completed ballots before Election Day, and at least one week prior to their individual state&#8217;s deadline. Some states may recommend allowing even more time for mailing completed ballots,&#8221; she said.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Michigan's delays</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Reporters for USA TODAY and its network of newsrooms across the country mailed envelopes in seven states and 10 cities.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Envelopes were addressed to destinations within the same county, often no more than a few miles away. Certified letters with $4.10 each in postage were sent within greater Cincinnati, Columbus and Detroit. GPS units were mailed in seven cities in Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania and Nebraska&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District, a competitive seat in a state that apportions electoral votes based on district-level balloting.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The envelopes were mailed from either home mailboxes, post offices or blue postal boxes. They were sent to a home address or Post Office box physically near the area&#8217;s election office, to approximate the path ballots would take.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="A ballot drop box is shown where voters can drop off absentee ballots instead of using the mail in Detroit.

Those delays came in the wake of changes by DeJoy, many of which have since been reversed by court order.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Christina Schlitt, the president of the Michigan League of Women Voters, said she was aware that the mail in Michigan was slow during the summer but did not realize it&#8217;s still delayed.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She said it makes her all the more confident in the League&#8217;s advice to voters, asking that they deliver absentee ballots to dropboxes or in person in the final two weeks of the election.</p><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Questionable scans</h3><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">To measure how long it took to deliver certified mail, USA TODAY compared the time of the post office&#8217;s initial scan with the date the agency&#8217;s tracking reported it delivered. That approach undoubtedly understates the size of the problem.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-investigations-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In one Ohio case, the post office didn&#8217;t scan a letter until five days after a reporter put the envelope in his outgoing mail. The online mail log for another letter lists just one event: the moment it was delivered.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The lack of consistent scanning raises questions about the reliability of all postal service data that claims to measure on-time performance.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/10/15/usps-false-scans-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">reported</a> last week that postal employees scanned millions of packages with incorrect delivery-designation codes &#8212; claiming that a customer&#8217;s driveway was blocked or that the recipient was not home, for example, when in fact the package never left the post office.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Some postal service errors in tracking, meanwhile, have the opposite effect of dragging down on-time delivery statistics.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In the USA TODAY tracking project, the post office totally lost track of at least two certified letters. The online system continues to list both letters as en route weeks after reporters received them.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The letters each arrived in the mailbox a day late.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Contributing, from the USA TODAY Network: Danielle Delfin, Gary White, Dak Le, Wade Tatengelo, Erin Mansfield, Carrie Seidman, Mike Stucka, Mark Wert, Kim Bui, Josh Susong, Craig Harris, Teresa Boeckel, Jessica Boehm, Karina Bland, Michael Squires, Wyatt Buchanan, Carrie Waters, Doug Schneider, Renee Hickman, Patrick Marley, Brian Dickerson, Steven Pepple, Kristen Shamus, Christina Hall, Elissa Robinson, Elisha Anderson, Frank Witsil, Chris Ullery, Kevin Dittman, Laura Schulte, Scott Fisher, Alison Dirr, Sarah Hauer.

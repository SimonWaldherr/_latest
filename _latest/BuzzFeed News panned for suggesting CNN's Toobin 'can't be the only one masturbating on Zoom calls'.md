"Haven&#8217;t we all done something on a work call that, in normal circumstances, we&#8217;d never do during a meeting?

"I mean, maybe not during an active Zoom call where your video is still on.

"Every day that the news makes us moan in mirth instead of groan in despair is a gift. Take this gift while you can, buy a webcam cover, and learn to watch porn on your phone in private mode like all the teens are doing."</p><p>BuzzFeed News&#160;was dragged on social media as critics suggest that the report was "normalizing" Toobin's misconduct.&#160;</p><p>"What fresh hell is this???"

Horatio Nelson towers over the pantheon of British heroes, and even his nemesis Napoleon kept a bust of the admiral in admiration – but such a statue would now be suspect.

Lord Nelson's "heroic status" will be reviewed by the National Maritime Museum as part of efforts to challenge Britain's "barbaric history of race and colonialism", The Telegraph can reveal.

The admiral's legacy is enshrined at the museum in Greenwich, which holds personal effects ranging from love letters to the coat Nelson wore when he was fatally shot during the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

Internal documents seen by The Telegraph reveal that the museum will capitalise on the "momentum built up by the Black Lives Matter movement" to make changes at the repository of naval treasures and address "aspects of slavery relating to the Royal Navy".

Nelson displays could be subject to "wholesale changes" in future, and the "more complex" nature of his heroism will be tackled by curators re-evaluating historical events and people as part of a new strategy.

The publicly-funded museum is seeking to communicate the "often barbaric history of race, colonialism and representation in British maritime history".

Statues of Royal Navy heroes such as Admiral Edward Pellew, lionised in the Hornblower series, have also been brought into the review of Britain's seafaring past.

The New Orleans Saints appear to be rounding into form.

The Saints, who were playing without star wide receiver Michael Thomas because of disciplinary reasons, won their second straight game with a 30-27 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Chargers in Monday's showdown at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.

Wil Lutz hit a field goal on the first possession of overtime, and Marshon Lattimore sealed the game by tackling Mike Williams a yard short of a first down on a fourth-down play.

Drew Brees and Emmanuel Sanders led the way for the Saints, who improved to 3-2 and move into a tie with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers atop the NFC South.

As for the Chargers, a four-touchdown showing from Justin Herbert was not enough to prevent a fourth consecutive loss. They are 1-4 and well behind the 4-1 Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West.

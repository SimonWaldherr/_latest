<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more</p><p>WASHINGTON &#8212; President Trump told campaign staff &#8220;we&#8217;re going to win this race&#8221; in a rouse-the-troops phone call Monday morning where said he would have up to five rallies a day and declared: &#8220;People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the presidential election just 15 days away, the commander-in-chief sought to rally his campaign staffers for the stretch run and sounded-off against his panel&#8217;s infectious disease expert, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/fauci-says-he-is-absolutely-not-surprised-that-trump-got-covid-19/">Dr. Anthony Fauci</a>, calling him a &#8220;disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People are tired of COVID,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;People are saying, &#8216;Whatever, just leave us alone.&#8217; They&#8217;re tired of it. CNN will play it all day long &#8212; that&#8217;s the only way they think they can win,&#8221; he went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people that have gotten it wrong. Fauci is a nice guy,&#8221; Trump said, calling the 79-year-old physician and researcher &#8220;a wonderful sage&#8221; who has &#8220;been here for 500 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump indicated he wanted to fire the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases but couldn&#8217;t because of potential public outrage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everytime he goes on television there&#8217;s always a bomb, but there&#8217;s a bigger bomb if you fire him. Fauci&#8217;s a disaster. If I&#8217;d listened to him we&#8217;d have 500,000 deaths,&#8221; Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump admitted that he wasn&#8217;t feeling so optimistic about his re-election chances while he was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/05/trump-released-from-walter-reed-hospital-after-receiving-covid-19-treatment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the hospital with the coronavirus</a> earlier this month and told his campaign staff to &#8220;work your assess off.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Let me give you the real truth, and they know on this, too, by the way: we&#8217;re going to win. I wouldn&#8217;t have told you that maybe two or three weeks ago,&#8221; Trump told statewide and campaign headquarters staff on his re-election effort. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more excited today than I was two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, I was in the hospital and people were shocked that I came out so fast and so healthy,&#8221; he said, defending his decision to jump back <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/11/trump-says-hes-immune-to-covid-19-ready-for-campaign-trail/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the campaign trail</a> &#8212; a physical feat the septuagenarian candidate admitted &#8220;wasn&#8217;t easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came out and immediately started holding and signing up rallies and people couldn&#8217;t believe it. It actually gave us a very positive energy. People see it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not easy, let me tell you,&#8221; Trump said, chuckling. &#8220;It&#8217;s no easy. It&#8217;s not an easy thing to do, folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief also said he planned to hold up to five rallies a day in the last days of the 2020 election race as polls show him and Democratic nominee Joe Biden <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/biden-campaign-memo-warns-trump-neck-and-neck-in-several-key-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">locked in a dead-heat</a> in some key swing states.</p>
<p>The president touched on a wide range of topics during the 20-minute call, disputing claims he wanted to fire his chief of staff Mark Meadows and railing against unflattering media coverage of his re-election chances.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are suppression stories and suppression polls but forget all that stuff because people don&#8217;t read the New York Times. They don&#8217;t give a s&#8211;t about it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trump also poured cold water on polls that show Biden leading nationwide, saying he had seen figures which showed them ahead in Arizona, Florida and Michigan and claimed if the election were held today, he would win North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a movement like no other,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trump 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien also touted their enormous ground operation, telling staff they had knocked on 3.2 million doors and made 7.4 million calls in the past week.</p>

President Trump has asked his campaign to get him back on the campaign trail every single day between now and the November election, according to a report.

The commander-in-chief’s reelection team, according to Axios, is now working to schedule events for the remainder of the 2020 election cycle.

Trump was forced to start campaigning virtually after being diagnosed with the novel virus earlier this month.

After his diagnosis, the president was airlifted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center where he was treated for three days before returning to the White House.

White House physician Sean Conley announced Saturday that he was no longer contagious.

Trump has continued to campaign virtually since returning home, though he hosted an in-person campaign event Saturday on the White House South Lawn, which he attended in a socially distanced-capacity from the Truman Balcony.

The balcony, which is accessible from the executive residences, overlooks the South Lawn.

The president has been eager to get back out on the road, as he told Fox Business’ “Sunday Morning Futures” over the weekend.

“I beat this crazy horrible China virus…I passed the highest test, the highest standards, and I’m in great shape. And I have to tell you I feel fantastically. I really feel good,” he told the network.

In a statement to Axios on his return to the campaign trail, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said, “The president has personal experience with COVID and understands what people are going through.”

The campaign did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

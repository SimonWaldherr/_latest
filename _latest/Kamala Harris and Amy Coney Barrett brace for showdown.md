With her vice-presidential debate with Mike Pence now in the rear-view mirror, friends and foe alike say Kamala Harris’ real make-or-break moment will be her coming confrontation with Judge Amy Coney Barrett.

Barrett, 48, a federal judge for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals was nominated by President Trump to the Supreme Court to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Though her confirmation likely has enough support from Republicans senators to make it over the finish line, she will still have to get through Senate Judiciary Committee hearings — and face Harris — who is a member.

“Either [Harris] is going to be nice and turn off some of her following or she’s going to be a Kavanaugh-style questioner … and she is going to offend the public at large. I would imagine she might be walking a tightrope,” Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who also serves on the committee, told The Post. “She is going to do everything she can to stop this nomination just like she did everything she could to stop [Brett] Kavanaugh.”

Veteran Democratic operative James Carville said a memorable performance from Harris, 55, is critical to her own future.

“Remember 2024 is not out of her mind. I think the confirmation hearings — unless something happens — are going to be more dramatic than the vice presidential debate,” Carville said. “I don’t think that Democrats feel like they need to go after Pence. … Pence doesn’t jack Democrats up like Trump. No one does.”

Harris must be mindful of her favorability rating, with 53% of voters approving of her elevation to Biden’s running mate.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is a who’s who of 2020 presidential also-rans. In addition to Harris, Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar will hammer away at the nominee.

Democrats have long praised Harris’ performance during the contentious confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh. The junior California senator and former prosecutor subjected Kavanaugh to a brutal grilling over allegations of sexual misconduct during high school and gave no ground in other exchanges covering his record.

Progressives say they expect to see the same fire and fury.

“Many of us believe it’s a GOP power grab,” Rahna Epting, executive director of the left-leaning non-profit MoveOn told The Post, speaking of Barrett’s nomination. “We want to see prosecutor Kamala Harris on the stage in these Senate hearings and do what the American people need her to do — which is expose who Amy Coney Barrett is.”

On the docket for the Democratic prosecution of Barrett will be her stances on abortion, Obamacare, gun rights, and the 2020 presidential election — an issue she will not recuse herself from if it goes before the Supreme Court after her confirmation, Politico reported. Her Catholic faith might also come into play as it did during her 2017 federal-court confirmation hearings when California Sen. Dianne Feinstein observed, “the dogma lives loudly in you.”

While liberals see many of their most hard-fought priorities at risk, Republicans look to complete their decades-long quest to cement a conservative majority on the court.

Of Harris, President Trump told reporters in August, “I thought she was the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful of anyone in the Senate.”

Republicans today echoed Grassley’s warning that any nuclear grandstanding won’t be without risk, and may spark a backlash among voters on the eve of an election.

“I expect [Harris] to be hyper-aggressive, to appeal to the base and to really be the attack dog in these hearings,” said Ian Prior, senior counsel for the of the conservative Article III Project. “I would be very surprised if that goes over well with the majority of the American people watching.”

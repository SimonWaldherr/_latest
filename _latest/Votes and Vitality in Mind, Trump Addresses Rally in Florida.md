“I turned on the fake news, story after story, they talk about your weather in the Panhandle,” he said, referring to hurricane coverage.

Supporters and critics of the president were likely to focus as much on how the president looked and sounded at the rally as on anything he said. The question of whether he will remain healthy enough to make it through a full Trumpian performance — usually about 90 minutes — without flagging is one that will likely hover over him until the election on Nov. 3. On Monday night, he appeared virtually back to himself despite a scratchy-sounding voice, clocking in at 65 minutes.

On Saturday at the White House, in his first public appearance since returning from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Mr. Trump spoke for only 18 minutes, uncharacteristically cutting an appearance short. His aides had said he would speak for 30 minutes. But top campaign officials said on Monday that they had no concerns about his energy or overall health, only enthusiasm that the candidate was ready to return to the campaign trail.

“This morning, in our morning conversation, he was getting on my case for not having enough rallies,” said Jason Miller, the Trump campaign’s senior strategist. He said the president’s schedule would include “two to three events a day, and that will grow as we get closer to Election Day.”

The frenetic pace serves as a reminder that with three weeks left in the race, Mr. Trump is running from behind. His polling numbers with seniors, a crucial constituency that has been disproportionately harmed by the coronavirus, have been flagging. His campaign has sought to stabilize its numbers with a new television advertisement aimed at changing the negative perception of Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic, quoting Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, seemingly praising the president.

“I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” Dr. Fauci said in a clip that he has since said was taken out of context and used without his consent. The campaign said it intended to continue airing the commercial.

Showing stamina while returning to a hectic campaign schedule less than two weeks after testing positive would help the president continue to play down the virus, just as he has done since March. And it is critical to the case that he has tried to mount against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, whom Mr. Trump has tried to portray as mentally and physically frail, unable to leave his basement or draw big, enthusiastic crowds.

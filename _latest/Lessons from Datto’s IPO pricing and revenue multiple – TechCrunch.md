<div><p>Lessons from Datto&#8217;s IPO pricing and revenue multiple How do you value slower, more profitable software growth?</p><p id="speakable-summary">Last night <a href="https://www.datto.com/">Datto</a> priced its IPO <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201020006334/en/Datto-Announces-Pricing-of-Its-Initial-Public-Offering#:~:text=(%E2%80%9CDatto%E2%80%9D)%2C%20(,public%20of%20%2427.00%20per%20share.">at $27 per share</a>, the top end of its range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/datto-sets-initial-ipo-price-range-indicating-a-valuation-of-around-4b/">that TechCrunch covered last week</a>. The data and security-focused software company had targeted a $24 to $27 per-share IPO price range, meaning that its final per-share value was at the top of its estimates.</p>

<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/datto" target="_blank">Datto </a> IPO won&#8217;t draw lots of attention; its business is somewhat dull, as selling software to managed service providers rarely excites. But, the public offering matters for a different reason: it gives us a fresh lens into today&#8217;s IPO market.</p>
<p>That lens is the perspective of slower, more profitable growth. What is&#160;that worth?</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300">The value of quickly-growing and unprofitable software and cloud companies is well known. Snowflake <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/19/was-snowflakes-ipo-mispriced-or-just-misunderstood/">made a splash earlier this year</a> on the back of huge growth and enormous losses. Investors ate its shares up, pushing its valuation to towering heights. And this year we&#8217;ve even seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/jfrog-and-snowflakes-aggressive-ipo-pricing-point-to-strong-demand-for-cloud-shares/">rapid growth and profits</a> valued by public investors in the form of JFrog&#8217;s IPO.</p>
<p>But slower growth, software margins and profitability? Datto&#8217;s financial picture feels somewhat unique among the IPOs that TechCrunch has covered this year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar bet to the one that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/egnyte" target="_blank">Egnyte </a> is making; the enterprise software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/13/the-newest-members-of-the-100m-arr-club/">crested $100 million ARR last year</a> and <a href="https://www.egnyte.com/press-releases/egnyte-announces-double-digit-revenue-momentum-year-over-year">announced</a> that it grew by around 22% in the first half of 2020. And, it is profitable on an EBITDA basis. Therefore, the Datto IPO could provide a clue as to what companies like Egnyte and the rest of the late-stage startup crop content to grow more slowly, but with the benefit of actually making money.</p>

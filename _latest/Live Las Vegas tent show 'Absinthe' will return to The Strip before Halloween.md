LAS VEGAS – After a live entertainment shutdown that lasted more than seven months, the popular tent show Absinthe at Caesars Palace will soon return to The Strip.

Voted a USA TODAY 10Best show in 2019, the adults-only performance of circus, burlesque and vaudeville acts on a circular stage will open inside "The Spiegeltent" on Oct. 28.

Tickets for performances Wednesday through Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m. are now on sale for the show “inspired by the absinthe-drenched cabarets of late 19th century Europe.” They are $149 and available online.

But ticket buyers will notice a few big changes inside the tent.

Strict health and safety measures are now in place to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission, Spiegelworld announced Monday.

Guests arriving for pre-show drinks must practice social distancing in the outdoor Green Fairy Garden.

Before entering the tent, visitors must be screened with non-contact temperature testing. Inside, masks are required. A new air purification system has been installed to filter the air.

With a capacity that's been reduced from 660 to 153, Absinthe will now have a new “cabaret-style seating format” inside the tent, where parties of two to five can sit at tables spaced 6 feet apart.

There will be no more lines at the bar to grab a drink. Tableside service will be provided during the show to keep guests in their seats.

The Spiegeltent will be cleaned and sanitized before and after every show.

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak last month issued an executive order loosening the state's 50-person cap on large gatherings and relaxing a host of other business restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.

Get-togethers of up to 250 people — as well as many live entertainment events, trade shows, concerts and conventions — are now allowed to resume, clearing the way for shows like "Absinthe" to run once again.

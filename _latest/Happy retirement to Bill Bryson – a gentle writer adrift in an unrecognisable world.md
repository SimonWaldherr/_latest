Of course, Bryson’s retirement may turn out to be temporary. Writers seem to have an even harder time quitting than old rock-stars. For instance, Michel Faber boldly announced in 2014 that he’d never publish another novel – but his new one came out just last month.

When writers quit for good, there’s usually a strong reason for them to do so. Philip Roth’s confidante Livia Manera Sambury told me the reasons behind his much-trumpeted retirement were physical: ill health and excruciating back pain meant he couldn’t comfortably use a writing desk. Those problems had dogged him for years – when he wrote 1997’s American Pastoral, she said, “he was only standing for 15 minutes at a time because of his back, then lying flat out on the floor for 15 minutes, then standing up again for 15 minutes.” In the end, the pain was too much.

Not all pain is physical. In January, I asked a well-known poet over drinks why it had been more than a decade since their last collection, and they confessed they were so deeply hurt by the negative reviews it received that they had stopped writing poems completely.

What should a retired writer do to fill the hours? Perhaps Bryson could take a leaf from Arthur Rimbaud’s book, and try out a new career or two. After writing his last poem, the 19th-century Frenchman became a soldier, a quarry worker, and finally a coffee-trader and gun-runner in Ethiopia.

The alternative is to renounce the world entirely, like Rosemary Tonks. After a religious conversion, the novelist and poet decided the literature business was the work of the devil, and became a total recluse.

When her former editor sent Tonks a postcard to tell her she was the subject of a new documentary, she didn’t reply. A while later, he sent another postcard, to let her know the documentary was being repeated. More silence. The only acknowledgement he got came after her death, when he found this entry in her diary from the week of the repeat: “Second postcard from Satan.”

Call me wicked, but I hope Bryson hasn’t turned his back on “Satan” forever.

It was sold to the country as a vital line of defence against Covid-19 – a state of the art operation to stop the virus before it had a chance to spread.

Ministers promised that the new £12 billion NHS Test and Trace programme would keep the virus at bay over the winter, allowing people to carry on their daily lives without fear of another lockdown.

"We have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place by June 1," Boris Johnson said in May.

More than five months later, Covid cases are surging again, and this week the Government's Sage committee issued its verdict – NHS Test and Trace is not working.

"The relatively low levels of engagement with the system, coupled with testing delays and likely poor rates of adherence with self-isolation, suggests that this system is having a marginal impact on transmission at the moment," the scientists wrote.

The latest figures show the system suffered its worst week for contact tracing. Ministers are now under pressure to lock down for two weeks or even longer, in part to fix the misfiring system, which is led by Baroness Dido Harding.

According to experts and Government insiders, too few people are getting tested, not enough of their contacts are being tracked down and instructions to self-isolate are mostly ignored.

In short, all three pillars of the Government's flagship programme – test, trace and isolate – are failing to deliver.

Test

As coronavirus faded over the summer, Boris Johnson made a bold promise to prepare for winter by increasing Britain's testing capacity to half a million every day by the end of October.

According to the latest data, however, the target appears a long way off.

Daily capacity is currently 344,426 tests, with 264,714 processed. To hit half a million by October 30, capacity would have to shoot up by 45 percent in the next fortnight. Yet data from NHS England showed that the number of tests completed last week only increased by five per cent compared to the week before.

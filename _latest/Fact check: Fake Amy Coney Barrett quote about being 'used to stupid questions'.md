The claim: Amy Coney Barrett said that as a mother of seven, she is 'used to stupid questions'

Near the start of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, asked her to hold up her notes.

Silently, Barrett lifted up a small notepad, which appeared to be blank.

"Is there anything on it?" Cornyn asked.

"The letterhead that says, 'United States Senate,'" Barrett replied.

The jovial exchange quickly became a viral hit on platforms like Twitter.

But a post on Facebook took it a step further, claiming that Barrett had elaborated on why she showed up to the Senate without reference materials.

"Judge Barrett is using no notes!" the post reads. "When asked why, she said 'I've got seven kids ... I'm used to stupid questions.'"

The user behind the post — which was shared almost a thousand times in six hours — did not respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.

Quip came from a commentator on Twitter, not Barrett herself

Though she does have seven children, aged 8 to 19, the quip about her children was not a line from Barrett herself.

It actually came from Becket Adams, a commentary writer for The Washington Examiner.

"i mean, she has seven kids. she’s used to answering stupid questions literally all day long," Adams wrote on Twitter. "only difference is her kids’ questions are probably more interesting."

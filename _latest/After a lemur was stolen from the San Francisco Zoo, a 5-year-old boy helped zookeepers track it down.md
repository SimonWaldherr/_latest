<p>It seemed unlikely that Maki, a 21-year-old arthritic lemur, could have gotten very far on his own.&#160;</p><p>So when officials at the San Francisco Zoo realized that the animal was missing from his enclosure on Wednesday, they immediately suspected foul play. They'd also <a href="https://www.insider.com/missing-lemur-was-found-returned-safely-san-francisco-zoo-2020-10">found evidence of forced entry at the enclosure</a>.</p><p>The search was on for Maki and his suspected kidnapper. San Francisco Police opened a case, and officers and zookeepers called on the public to help them find the ring-tailed lemur &#8211; a member of an endangered species whose median life expectancy is around 16 years.</p><p>Zoo officials even offered a $2,100 reward for information leading to Maki's safe retrieval.</p>

<p>"We understand that lemurs are adorable animals, but Maki is a highly endangered animal that requires special care. We are asking the public for help in his return," Dr. Jason Watters, the zoo's executive vice president of animal behavior and wellness, <a href="https://abc7news.com/san-francisco-zoo-missing-lemur-maki-police/7031021/">told ABC 7</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the search ended quickly. On Thursday, 5-year-old James Trinh was leaving preschool when he spotted Maki in the parking by his school's playground. Trinh attends the Hope Lutheran Day School in Daly City, just 5 miles from the zoo.&#160;</p><p>

</p><p>"There's a lemur! There's a lemur!" Trinh cried.</p><p>School director Cynthia Huang was skeptical at first, but soon realized Trinh was correct. Maki bounded from the parking lot to a miniature playhouse on the playground, where he hid as the school alerted the police. Officers from the Daly City Police Department contained Maki until zoo caretakers arrived on the scene.</p>

Then there is the coffee subscription, an effort to drive people back to the stores: Five drinks a day made by a barista (coffees, teas and smoothies) for £20 a month. On the face of it, it could be an extraordinarily good deal. With two lattes a week, a subscriber will break even. And the first month is free. (Small print: You can’t order five drinks at once — there must be 30 minutes between each drink order.)

Pret’s whole business model hasn’t collapsed, just one crucial part of it, said Jessica Spungin, who teaches strategy and entrepreneurship at London Business School. Many people are still working, and they still need to eat a quick lunch. “How they can sell it to them is different because these people are no longer where they used to be,” she said.

The only way through this, if there is a way through this, is for Pret to experiment with lots of “small, low risk” ideas at once, Ms. Spungin said.

Mr. Christou, 42, sees this as an opportunity for Pret to become a different type of company. Rather than worry about whether workers will return to their offices and what the government’s advice will be, Pret needs to transform.

“I don’t think customers should help Pret. I think it’s down to Pret to figure out what it does and how it evolves,” Mr. Christou said at the company’s headquarters last month, on his first anniversary of becoming chief executive.

He joined Pret 20 years ago as an assistant manager, after a stint at McDonald’s. Since then, he has risen up the ranks through operational roles overseeing stores in London, Edinburgh and Leeds. When he took over the helm, he was supposed to be overseeing an expansion. His predecessor had just bought a rival chain to accelerate the growth of the company’s vegetarian and vegan spinoff, Veggie Pret.

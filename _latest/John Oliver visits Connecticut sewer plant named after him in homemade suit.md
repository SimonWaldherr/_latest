<div><p>John Oliver took a jaunt to Connecticut for a real fecal matter over the weekend &#8212; the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the sewer plant <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/09/danbury-ct-officially-named-its-sewage-plant-after-john-oliver/">named in his honor</a>.</p>
<p>Video of the British funnyman&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/john-oliver-will-visit-ct-to-see-sewer-plant-named-after-him/">trip on Sunday</a> showed him wearing homemade COVID-19 protective gear &#8212; a belted clear plastic trash bag, blue medical gloves taped at the wrists and a see-through helmet.</p>
<p>&#8220;This place takes the worst that humanity can produce, and transforms it into something that we can live with,&#8221; Oliver said of the crappy honors. &#8220;And now more than ever, there&#8217;s something inspirational in that, because at the end of this awful, awful year, what could be more important than evidence that, if we want to, we can come together, overcome our differences and sort our s&#8212;- out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&#8221; host had his name plastered on the poop plant after going on an expletive-filled rant about Danbury in August.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are going to forget a town in Connecticut, why not forget Danbury because &#8212; and this is true &#8212; f&#8211;k Danbury,&#8221; Oliver said on the segment, which aired Aug. 16.</p>
<p>Mayor Mark Boughton responded to the barb with his own &#8212; saying the city was going to name the plant after Oliver &#8220;because it&#8217;s full of crap just like you, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oliver promised to donate $55,000 to local charities if Danbury followed through.</p>
<p>The plant was officially renamed &#8220;The John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant&#8221; earlier this month.</p>
<p>Boughton said the ribbon-cutting was kept private as a public health precaution.</p>

In that video, Bieber struts around a house party at a mansion, and lip synchs lyrics about promiscuity, alcohol use and the decadence of fame. But in "Lonely," Bieber doesn't lionize fame -- instead, the song paints a much more realistic image of what it means to be world famous as a teenager. </p><a></a><p>Back in September 2019, Bieber <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B17JfkkHEKt/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank">posted on social media</a> about mental health, reflecting on the mistakes he had made in his past.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"I was 18, with no skills in the real world, with millions of dollars and access to whatever I wanted," Bieber writes. "This is a very scary concept for anyone." </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Shortly after "Lonely" was released, Bieber tweeted about his experience making the song.  </p><p></p><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-13 cn-zoneAdContainer"></ul><a></a><p>"To be honest the song is hard for me to listen to considering how tough it was to get through some of these chapters," Bieber <a href="https://twitter.com/justinbieber/status/1316954343812354048" target="_blank">writes</a> . "I believe it is powerful to express vulnerability and that's why I believe this song is so powerful."</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"Lonely" is the second single off of Bieber's recently released album "Changes." </p></div>

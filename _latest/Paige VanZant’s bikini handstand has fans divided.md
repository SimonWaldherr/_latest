Paige VanZant’s latest post has her 2.7 million Instagram fans divided.

On Friday, the 26-year-old fighter — who endured a COVID-19 scare with husband Austin Vanderford last month — shared a pair of bikini photos with her followers, prompting them to weigh in on her handstand skills.

“1 or 2???? Comment below,” VanZant captioned the post.

While the first shot appeared to be the favorite among fans, some followers got cheeky in the comments, dropping the peach emoji.

VanZant has kept fans entertained on social media throughout the coronavirus pandemic and, most recently, during her transition to the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. In August, she agreed to a four-fight deal with the organization, worth more than $1 million.

“This has been in talks ever since I was a free agent. This is kind of where I felt the most passionate about, and it completely lined up with what I wanted and what they wanted and we were really able to create a happy partnership,” VanZant said during her introductory press conference over the summer. “It’s a win-win for both of us.”

As for her critics, VanZant recently offered a bold statement to accompany another poolside snap.

“Jealousy is just love and hate at the same time,” she wrote last week.

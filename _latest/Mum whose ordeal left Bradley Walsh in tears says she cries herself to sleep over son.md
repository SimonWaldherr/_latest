A mum who has been locked out of her son’s care home, is pleading with the Government: “Please stop our tears and let us back in”.

Ruth Adams, 66, says she cries herself to sleep, because she can’t be by Sam’s side as he enters the later stages of Huntington’s Disease.

Her ordeal, caused by Covid restrictions, left Bradley Walsh distraught on ITV’s This Morning.

Talking about her fight to see Sam, 33, she said: “I have had seven months of hell. I have been grieving about my inability to be with Sam and love him, while he’s still here.

"We’re locked out, he’s locked in. It’s wicked. I cannot put the hell we are all going through into words.”

Before the pandemic Ruth, Sam’s dad, Allan Adams , 75, and daughter Hannah, 31, took it in turns spending six hours a day at the care home.

Now they are allowed just one visit a week.

“We are Sam’s world. Hannah can make him smile with just one look, it’s astounding,” Ruth said.

“When we’re not there he has no life, no interests, no love. No one to sit and hold his hand.

“It’s not the home’s fault. They do an amazing job. But they can’t give love like his family.”

Ruth says she has self-isolated at home in East Sussex, to stay safe, adding: “All they have to do is give us a regular test, like they do carers.”

She says Sam can now spend all day on his own - apart from necessary care and since lockdown he’s lost weight, can’t speak clearly, has become incontinent and is wheelchair-bound.

Distraught Ruth added: “I want to handcuff myself to No10. I have to do something.”

Her son, training as an electrician, was diagnosed with the fatal genetic disorder aged 26 after a bad fall.

The Department of Health and Social Care said: “Many people will not display symptoms despite having coronavirus and therefore visiting at a time of high prevalence may put loved ones and other residents at risk.”

'IM PREGNANT!!!! Wow, it feels so good to finally share this news with you guys! Where do I even begin?,' she wrote in her blog. 'For YEARS it has been the question from everyone since I got married. At first, I rebelled against it, and like clockwork, after I got engaged EVERYONE (and I mean everyone!) asked when I was getting married.'

Ashley and Christopher celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary in September.

'Then, once I was married, everyone was asking when I was having kids,' she added. 'To be honest, it just felt invasive. I wasn't ready for that step yet and I wanted to be selfish and have Chris all to myself for a while. Honestly, I wouldn't have had it any other way.'

The High School Musical star admitted to enduring a difficult first trimester and is looking forward to sharing her pregnancy journey with her friends and family.

'I've had my highs and lows during quarantine and have to say I'm so grateful for this gift. It hasn't been an easy first trimester, but everyone is different and I know there are people who've had it way worse,' she wrote.

'I definitely fall somewhere in the middle where I didn't just have nausea, but threw up a couple of times and felt like I've had stomach flu for three months (Lol!).

She added: 'I'm excited about this new adventure, and I'm being very optimistic with every step. Chris and I are so excited and are fully embracing and celebrating this monumental moment. I love you guys and I'm so excited to have you part of this ride!

<div><p>That&#8217;s not how it works.</p>
<p>A fan who caught a home run from Dodgers catcher Will Smith in the sixth inning threw his glove at Rays outfielder Randy Arozarena.</p>
<p>Why did he pump fake throwing the ball multiple times?</p>
<p>Why was he dancing after he threw the glove?</p>
<p>Was he over-served, perhaps?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this story ends with more questions than answers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arozarena is as confused as the rest of the world,&#8221; remarked Joe Buck on the Fox broadcast as they showed the replay. &#8216;He caught the ball then threw the glove in a moment of sheer ecstasy.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/22/brandon-lowe-belts-2-homers-as-rays-win-game-2-of-world-series/">The Rays held on to beat the Dodgers</a>, 6-4, to even the World Series at one game each. It is being played in Arlington, Texas with a limited number of fans, including one who has apparently been away from the ballpark too long.</p>
<p>The fan did get his glove back as Fox showed Arozarena <a href="https://twitter.com/Jomboy_/status/1319116240791740418?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tossing it back to him</a>.</p>

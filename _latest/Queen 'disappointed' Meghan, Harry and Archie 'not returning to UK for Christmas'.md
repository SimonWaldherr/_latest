They are expected to travel to the UK days later.</p> <p>The Queen and husband Prince Philip haven't seen their great-grandson Archie, who was born in May 2019, for a year, and they have never spent a Christmas with him at the monarch's estate Sandringham, Norfolk, along with other members of the Royal Family.</p>

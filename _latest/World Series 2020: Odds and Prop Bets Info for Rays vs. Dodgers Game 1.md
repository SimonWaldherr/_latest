If you are undecided on the overall number of runs, you could turn to the individual team props.&#160;</p><p id="br-ad-29245129" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Tampa Bay is not projected to push many runs across the plate Tuesday, but if you believe the Rays can score three times in nine innings, that prop could be your best bet of the evening.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>World Series Game 1 Odds</strong></p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png">Video Play Button</a><p class="atom video-indicator"><p class="text">Videos you might like </p> </p><p class=""><strong>Money Line:&#160;</strong>Los Angeles Dodgers (-182); Tampa Bay (+155)</p><p class=""><strong>Over/Under:&#160;</strong>7.5</p><p class=""><strong>Run Line:&#160;</strong>Los Angeles Dodgers (-1.5; +117); Tampa Bay (+1.5; -139)</p><p class="">Odds via <a href="https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/event/179574738?category=odds&amp;subcategory=popular" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DraftKings Sportsbook</a>.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Top Prop Bets</strong></p><p class=""><strong>Clayton Kershaw &amp; Tyler Glasnow Under 6.5 Strikeouts</strong></p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">Eric Gay/Associated Press</p><p class="">Upon first glance, the strikeout props for the two starters does not seem hard to reach, but with the stakes higher, the difficulty will be raised.&#160;</p><p class="">In the 2019 World Series, each of Houston's first three starters recorded six strikeouts. Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg had seven punch outs in their outings for Washington.&#160;</p><p class="">In Game 1, Scherzer struck out <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU201910220.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the final batter</a> of his five-inning outing to reach seven strikeouts. Strasburg produced <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU201910230.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the same result</a>&#160;in the sixth frame of Game 2 to hit that total.&#160;</p><p class="">Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander only struck out six batters opposite Scherzer and Strasburg in those heavyweight matchups.&#160;</p><p class="">Kershaw is the only of the Game 1 starters to have World Series experience. In his five Fall Classic outings, he fanned an average of just over five batters.&#160;</p><p class="">In fact, the southpaw's only World Series performance with <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=kershcl01&amp;t=p&amp;year=0&amp;post=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than five</a> strikeouts was his first appearance in Game 1 of the 2017 clash with Houston.&#160;</p><p class="">If you apply the Game 1 strikeout prop to Kershaw's last eight playoff starts, the over would have hit once. He had 13 strikeouts in the wild-card round against Milwaukee.&#160;</p><p id="br-ad-103844575" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Glasnow led the Rays in strikeouts and started the postseason strong with 18 whiffs in his first two starts, but since then, he has eight strikeouts over 7.1 innings.&#160;</p><p class="">Houston struck out on <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=glasnty01&amp;t=p&amp;year=0&amp;post=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five occasions</a> in Game 4 of the ALCS versus Glasnow. The Astros also fanned eight times versus the right-hander hurler in seven ALDS innings in 2019.&#160;</p><p class="">Although the Dodgers <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2020_NLCS.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">struck out 67 times</a> in the NLCS, only one Atlanta pitcher recorded more than 10 whiffs.&#160;</p><p class="">Tampa Bay was more susceptible to strikeout since it <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2020_ALCS.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fanned 81 times</a> in the ALCS and allowed Lance McCullers Jr. and Framber Valdez to combine for 35 punch outs.&#160;</p><p class="">Despite those totals, the Rays still found some success against Houston's starters by tagging them for 11 earned runs.&#160;</p><p class="">If they get to Kershaw early, the Rays could force Dave Roberts to call on his bullpen to clean up behind his Game 1 starter.&#160;</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Tampa Bay Team Total (Over 2.5)</strong></p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">Jae C. Hong/Associated Press</p><p class="">The ALCS was not a high-scoring series, but the Rays managed to score <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2020_ALCS.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least three runs</a> in six of those seven contests.&#160;</p><p class="">Even with Kershaw on the mound, it is worth taking the Tampa Bay team over because the number is so low.&#160;</p><p class="">The key to that prop going over should be the powerful right-handed bats of Randy Arozarena, Manuel Margot and Mike Zunino.</p><p class="">The trio combined for nine of the Rays' 11 ALCS home runs. Arozarena and Margot have decent splits against left-handed pitchers.&#160;</p><p id="br-ad-20924883" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Arozarena had a <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.fcgi?id=arozara01&amp;year=2020&amp;t=b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.478 OPS</a> and 1.000 slugging percentage against southpaws in the regular season, while Margot recorded <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.fcgi?id=margoma01&amp;year=2020&amp;t=b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a .633 OPS</a> in those matchups.&#160;</p><p class="">One of Arozarena's four ALCS home runs came off Houston left-hander Framber Valdez in Game 1, and all he needs is one or two batters to get on base in front of him to provide a multiple-run boost.&#160;</p><p class="">Since the projected team total is fairly low and the Rays have some power bats in their lineup, it is worth taking a flier on this prop.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class="">Follow Joe on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/JTansey90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JTansey90</a>.</p><p class="">Statistics obtained from <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baseball Reference</a>.</p></div>

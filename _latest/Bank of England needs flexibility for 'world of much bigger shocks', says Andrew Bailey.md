  Bank of England needs flexibility for 'world of much bigger shocks', says Andrew Bailey 
description: > 
  Andrew Bailey has signalled his support for a more flexible approach to the Bank of England’s inflation target as central banks shift to cope with a “world of much bigger shocks”.The Bank Governor said shocks since the financial crisis had “necessitated a search for a more flexible form” of policy with the US central bank recently adopting an average inflation target.The Bank of England has a 2pc inflation target but other central banks are moving towards a more flexible approach.The Federal Reserve has adopted an average inflation target, meaning it will tolerate higher price rises and can leave stimulus in place for longer.Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president, has also hinted at a similar change as it conducts a strategy review.

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think changing the target is the right way to think about it but I think it&#8217;s appropriate that many of us are thinking about the question of how we achieve the target in a world of much bigger shocks,&#8221; he said at the G30 International Banking Seminar.</p>

Cardi B and Offset were in bed together when she accidentally posted a nude photo to Instagram this week.

The WAP rapper shared the news herself on Wednesday while on Instagram Live.

'I’m leaning in the f***king bed, right? And I’m telling Offset, "Yo I feel like…I’m taking the f***ing picture and then I f***ing press and I see that it’s loading and I’m like "Oh my God! Oh my God, Offset! Oh my God, the picture’s loading!"' the 28-year-old star said.

The performer said Offset told her: 'Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.'

Offset then told her that the photo made it onto Instagram: 'There is a picture of the f***ing tit!'

She panicked when she realized the world had seen the topless image.

'By the time I turned my phone on and deleted that s**t, everybody and their mom saw. They were all over the internet,' explained the Bronx born beauty who has worked with Jennifer Lopez and Megan Thee Stallion.

Cardi and Offset seem to be back on as they were affectionate at her Playboy birthday party together then at Allure Gentlemen’s Club in Atlanta, Georgia.

With her husband: 'I’m leaning in the f***king bed, right? And I’m telling Offset, "Yo I feel like…I’m taking the f***ing picture and then I f***ing press and I see that it’s loading and I’m like "Oh my God! Oh my God, Offset! Oh my God, the picture’s loading!"' the 28-year-old star said

But she filed for divorce from him last month in Atlanta as she stated in her court documents that 'no prospects for a reconciliation' exist. Cardi was requesting child support, legal costs and custody of their toddler in the divorce case which was slated to come before a court on November 4.

The Bronx-born celeb, whose Christian name is Belcalis Marlenis Almanzar, said: ''I don’t have a bad relationship with my baby father. At all.'

She continued: 'I don't have no hatred towards him. And I don't wish him nothing bad and I know that he feels the same way about me.'

The pair the knot in secret in their own bedroom in 2017 and then the following year she went public with the fact they were married.

She gave birth to their daughter Kulture in July 2018 and split from Offset that December but got back together with him shortly thereafter.

Meanwhile, Cardi was slammed for her topless photo during her wild birthday festivities as social media user rudely questioned the size of her areolas.

The rapper defended her photo as she revealed her 'nipples got bigger' due to breastfeeding her daughter Kulture, now two, for three months.

They wrote: 'why yo areolas so big' (sic), to which the WAP hitmaker replied: 'cause i breastfeed a baby for 3 months t**ties got bigger so nipples got bigger [shrug].'

She ended her response with an incredibly cheeky comment.

The media personality boldly ended her comment by penning: 'It's ok let me know if your daddy wanna get breastfed.'

She also tweeted a voice memo to address the racy picture as she said 'Ah, Lord. Lord, why the f*** did you have to make me so f***ing stupid and retarded? Why? Why, why why?' she sighed on her Twitter voice message hours later.

'You know what, I’m not even gonna beat myself up about it. I’m just gonna eat my breakfast. I’m just gonna eat my breakfast, right?' she said.

'I’m gonna eat my breakfast and then I’m gonna go to a party, because I’m not even gonna think about it. I am not going to think about it, okay?'

Cardi continued: 'Nope, no, I’m not. I won’t, it is what it is, s*** happen. F*** it. It’s not even the first time. I mean I used to f***ing be a stripper so whatever. Ay, Dios mio.'

Shortly after the picture leaked she wrote on Insta Stories: 'I did not posted no story about me suing nobody ....nobody to be sued for .It was my f*** up...s*** happens.'

The Bodak Yellow hitmaker has been surrounded by loved ones amid her raucous birthday celebrations with little evidence of masks and social distancing.

Cardi's celebrity guests included her WAP duet partner Megan Thee Stallion, as well as Kylie Jenner who had a cameo in their music video.

Her multiple parties, which have been going on since the weekend, have whisked the rap diva from Las Vegas to Atlanta.

At one point she was also glimpsed on video straddling Offset and dancing as he lay on his back on the floor underneath her.

By late Monday night the Hustlers actress and the Migos member were in Atlanta partying at Allure Gentlemen's Club.

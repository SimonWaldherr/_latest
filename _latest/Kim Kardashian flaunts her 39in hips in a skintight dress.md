'I loved creating this collection and I canâ€™t wait to see the looks you create with it.'

In another shot the bombshell got a bit messy, wrapping her arm around an elegant birthday cake as she donned a skintight, baby blue sweater with a high neck.

Kim modeled caramel highlighted locks in the first photos, where she posed with a giant faux birthday cake in a a sexy silver bikini which tried its hardest to hold in her bust.

Continuing to turn up the heat, she was seen donning sheer metallic bottoms and clear platform heels in a followup shot while she crouched down and let her hair cascade down to elegantly mask her modesty.

Kim wasn't shy about starting the celebrations early.

Earlier in the day she shared some stunning shots in a shimmering pink patent leather corset and matching pants to mark the occasion.

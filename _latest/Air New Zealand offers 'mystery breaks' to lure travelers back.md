description: > 
  Air New Zealand is bringing back its Mystery Breaks program, where travelers pay a flat fee to book an entire vacation package with the airline and agree not to find out their destination until two days before they leave.The packages, which begin at $599 AUD ($422 USD), allow travelers to choose from three tiers -- Great, Deluxe or Luxury.They will also select the dates they wish to travel and one place they are not interested in going.According to the New Zealand Ministry of Health, the country has had 1,531 confirmed coronavirus cases within its borders, and just 25 deaths.Tourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA), a national body made up of many tourism industry partners, has requested assistance from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, whose government recently won re-election by a decisive majority.

<div><p>The presenter&#160;on the pandemic ruining her birthday, horse riding in Ireland and&#160;a lucky escape in Israel...</p>
<h3>I have a romantic attachment</h3>
<p>...to the Needles on the Isle of Wight. During lockdown, I was stuck in London while my husband was at the family home in Hampshire. I dreamed of looking out over the Needles &#8211; one of my favourite views. I first went to the island when I was nine or 10. Then, when I was a reporter on South Today, I went over to the Needles Lighthouse. The Solent was choppy and it was one of the most terrifying boat rides of my life.</p>
<h3>I missed out on going to India as a child</h3>
<p>...when I was a child. My dad got a job there, but I wanted to go to Barnsley Girls&#8217; High School so I stayed here with grandma. My mother told me amazing tales, so finally, the year before last, my husband and I decided to go.</p>
<h3>We made a bad choice in how to see India</h3>
<p>...as we went to the Golden Triangle through a travel company that said it took small groups of like-minded people. We ended up on the grimmest huge coach for up to eight hours at a time on terrifying Indian roads. The forts and castles were incredible but we were just exhausted. So the plan is to do it again but slowly, with a personal driver. It&#8217;s not much more expensive.</p>
<h3>I wouldn't go to the Taj Mahal again</h3>
<p>...because of the queues to get through security and the hordes of people all over it. There&#8217;s no doubt that it&#8217;s exquisite but don&#8217;t expect the Diana, Princess of Wales, shot. Instead I want to go to Kolkata and trace the bungalow where my parents lived.</p>

<h3>I&#8217;ve stayed in former palaces of maharajas</h3>
<p>...but there you are, a western tourist having lovely food in this exquisite place with a gateway for elephants to pass through, and you step out into a village with the most appalling poverty. And there&#8217;s rubbish everywhere. I had real difficulty with that.</p>
<h3>As a child, I loved the beach</h3>
<p>...but I am terrified of the sea now. When I was in Israel in my 20s, I went to the beach with some guys I worked with. That part of the Mediterranean had very strong currents but it was very warm and I jumped over the waves &#8211; then found nothing beneath me. I was a strong swimmer but it wasn&#8217;t happening, so I shouted for help. The boys just managed to get to me before the currents dragged me down. Now I prefer to be on the promenade.</p>
<h3>Israel was constantly dangerous</h3>
<p>...when I worked there between 1969 and 1972. One day, I was returning to Jaffa after going into Tel Aviv to get some bacon at the Arab market and just as the bus I was on pulled out, a bomb went off at the stop. It smashed a window near me.</p>
<h3>When I was made a Dame</h3>
<p>...my abode in London was a basement flat, which I called Wuthering Depths, so I suggested we splash out on two nights at Claridge&#8217;s. I&#8217;d been there to interview people before and thought how marvellous it was. It was beautiful and is the best hotel in London that I&#8217;ve ever stayed at. I can rarely afford it, but I do love luxury. I&#8217;m not a camping person.</p>
<h3>The best horse riding experience</h3>
<p>...of my life was in Ireland. I&#8217;m passionately fond of horses. When the children were small, we hired a gipsy caravan to go around the Dingle peninsula, where the beaches go on forever. One day, my son Ed and I galloped flat out along the sand and in the surf for what felt like miles. I can&#8217;t do it now, since I had my hips replaced, but it&#8217;s the most invigorating thing imaginable.</p>

<h3>You wouldn't get me on a plane</h3>
<p>...for any money at the moment, but I&#8217;m old enough to remember when airports were exciting places. These days, it&#8217;s just queues, stuff being thrown at you to buy, ages going through security&#8230;</p>
<h3>The worst trip I ever did was to New Zealand</h3>
<p>...in 2011 for the Rugby World Cup. My elder boy was working out there. How I stood the amount of time I had to spend on an aeroplane, I really don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s a beautiful country.</p>
<h3>One of the best culinary experiences</h3>
<p>...of my life was when I spent a whole summer as a student in Montpellier. One evening, about 15 of us crammed into a few deux-chevaux cars and drove out to a shack on the beach at Palavas. The sea was almost lapping around our feet and we had moules marini&#232;re, frites cooked to perfection and a lovely Proven&#231;al ros&#233;, followed by chocolate mousse.</p>
<h3>This damn virus ruined by 70th birthday</h3>
<p>...in May because the plan was that the whole family was going to Paris. We were going to have a lovely dinner and go up the Eiffel Tower, which is very high on my bucket list. Although I once worked in Paris as a tour hostess, I never got up there. The tourists would go up while I stayed at the bottom to check them all off. At some point in the near future, we will go over on Eurostar.</p>

Best Buy is launching a shopping event on October 13 and 14 to compete with Amazon's Prime Day 2020 deals.

The deals will run parallel to Amazon's two-day Prime Day event and shoppers will likely see a lot of comparable bargains and some overlap between the two storefronts.

Best Buy, unlike Amazon, offers curbside pickup, store pickup, and in-store shopping, in addition to shipping.

We will be updating this post with deals once Best Buy's event begins.

It's official: Best Buy will join the Prime Day 2020 fray and offer several discounts starting October 13. During this competing sale, we are likely to see discounts on Apple devices, laptops, big-screen TVs, and kitchen appliances.

Best Buy promises that customers will have "more ways to shop safely than ever before, including contactless curbside pickup" plus new safety guidelines in-store.

What deals should I expect?

While Best Buy has yet to reveal the entire breadth of its sales event, it highlighted a few upcoming deals. Shoppers can expect laptops starting as low as $120, JBL Free true wireless headphones for $70, and a Samsung 70-inch 4K smart TV for $530.

In addition to the aforementioned deals, we expect Best Buy will offer many more deals across various product categories, including smart home devices, gaming, computers, home theater, and kitchen appliances. Shoppers can expect heavy discounts on products from Best Buy's in-house brands, including Insignia, Rocketfish, Dynex, and Init.

Best Buy will also likely match many of the discounts offered by Amazon, Target, and Walmart on top brands like Samsung, Apple, Microsoft, and more.

The best early Best Buy deals

When is Best Buy's competing Prime Day sale?

Best Buy, like Amazon, will offer massive discounts on October 13 and 14. This two-day sale would be the kickoff to Best Buy's Black Friday sale (historically, the sales event occurs directly after Thanksgiving Day.)

Earlier this year, Best Buy announced that it would be one of several companies that would close stores during Thanksgiving and claimed that it would offer holiday deals earlier to accommodate for its closure.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether the deals we see on October 13 and 14 will represent the entirety of Best Buy's Black Friday sale.

Why should I shop at Best Buy instead of Amazon?

There is one big benefit to shopping Best Buy over Amazon: its lower price guarantee. Best Buy says that says any qualifying item purchased during Best Buy's competing sale sees a lower price before November 28 (or a day after Black Friday,) Best Buy will refund the difference.

Purchases from Best Buy come with a much larger return window than the usual 15-day we're used to. Purchases between October 13 and January 2, 2021, can be returned through January 16, 2021. However, Amazon's return policy trumps this by a few weeks; purchases made during the same time period can be returned until January 31, 2021.

Can I shop in the Best Buy near me?

Shoppers can visit Best Buy locations to take advantage of these early Black Friday deals â€” a stark contrast to Amazon's online-only approach. The retailer is also rolling out new safety protocols for shopping in stores, including requiring customers and employees to wear face masks and limiting the number of visitors.

Additionally, Best Buy offers contactless curbside pickup, store pickup, in addition to same-day and next-day delivery options.

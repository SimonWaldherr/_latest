<p>"KAH-mah-la, Kah-MAH-la, Kamala-mala-mala, I don't know, whatever," Perdue <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sen-david-purdue-mispronounces-kamala-harris-name-at-trump-rally-2020-10">said</a> at a Friday Trump rally in front of thousands of supporters. Perdue's campaign communications director, John Burke, later said that the GOP senator "simply mispronounced Senator Harris' name."</p><p>Many others, however, were quick to condemn Perdue's comments given the fact that he and Harris have served in the US Senate together for over three years.&#160;</p><p>"Well that is incredibly racist," Sabrina Singh, Kamala Harris' campaign press secretary <a href="https://twitter.com/sabrinasingh24/status/1317234609105547266">tweeted</a> on Friday.</p><p>This isn't the first time that the Georgia senator landed in hot water for attacking a Democratic candidate. Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-senator-deletes-campaign-ad-that-enlarged-jewish-opponents-nose-2020-7">accused</a> Perdue in July of using an anti-Semitic trope in a Facebook ad that portrayed Ossoff, who's Jewish, to have an enlarged nose.</p>

<p>The ad read: "Democrats are trying to buy Georgia." The Perdue campaign deleted the ad and later <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-senator-deletes-campaign-ad-that-enlarged-jewish-opponents-nose-2020-7">said</a> that the nose enlargement was an "unintentional" edit. Perdue and Ossoff are in a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-senate-race-david-perdue-vs-jon-ossoff-polls-fundraising-2020-8">tight US Senate race</a> in a state that has historically voted Republican.</p>

This up-and-comer outshines its more established (and expensive) peers in terms of both value and functionality.

If you want to make sure your online activities are undetectable and untraceable, you need a VPN — and these six providers offer plans that are cheaper than your daily latte.

UPDATE: October 22, 2019, 2:55 p.m. EDT This story has been updated following news that a NordVPN server was breached .

All those hours you've spent searching for the perfect Arrested Development reaction GIF or drooling over mukbangs on YouTube seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things — but to Google, hackers, your internet service provider (ISP), and even certain government agencies, that browsing history is a valuable commodity.

And guess what? They're probably tracking and logging every digital move you make. Like, right now.

Such is the importance of a virtual private network, or VPN.

We've dedicated tens of thousands of words to waxing poetic about all of the benefits of using a VPN, but for the uninitiated, here's the nitty-gritty: A VPN is a service that makes your web presence more difficult to track and trace. And if someone can't track or trace your web presence, they can't collect your personal data and do icky things with it — like sell it to advertisers or use it to incriminate you in nefarious activities.

If you've ever looked into using a VPN before, you've probably noticed that some of them are free, while others require paid subscription plans. That's odd, you might've thought at the time. Why would anyone choose to pay for a VPN if free ones exist?

It's tempting to give free VPNs a shot — hey, free is free is free — but if your budget allows it, you should *always* opt for a paid provider. Here's why.

Why should you pay for a VPN?

The short answer is this: There's no such thing as a free lunch.

A VPN keeps you anonymous online by masking your IP address and encrypting your traffic through its secure servers, and while it would be nice of providers to give away and maintain this technology for free, they have to make money somehow. (Capitalism, amiright?) So, if they're not charging you a monthly or annual fee to use their service, they're likely logging and selling your data in order to pay their bills. Some even have the audacity to seed their products with spyware. In the best-case scenario, that data will be used to generate eerily specific ads based on your browsing history. At worst, your privacy will be compromised.

On the plus side, we've found that many paid VPN providers are willing to offer their services for cheap (as in, "less than $4 a month" cheap) so long as you commit to a long-term subscription. Keep reading to find out which of these providers we like best — and don't forget to click the gray arrow in the upper-right corner of each card to expand our write-ups.

$5.99/month (billed $71.88 every 12 months) 24-month plan: $1.99/month with coupon code "sharkstart" (billed $47.76 every 24 months) See Details 1. Surfshark This up-and-comer outshines its more established (and expensive) peers in terms of both value and functionality.

As far as cons go, Surfshark has a small server network compared to the other VPNs on this list with just over 1,700 of them spread throughout 63 countries. The only other downside we see to Surfshark — and admittedly, this one's kind of a reach — is that it's a really, really young company that's still solidifying a reputation among users. (It was founded in 2018.) But based what we've read in preliminary reviews, we think it's more than capable of competing with older VPN services like PureVPN and NordVPN, which have been around since 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Additional features: For just $1.99 a month, you can activate two additional

Cue the Jaws theme song: Surfshark takes a bite out of expensive VPN services by offering tons of features at a great value, including a kill switch, DNS protection, an ad blocker, and AES 256-bit encryption. It's capable of handling even high-bandwidth activities like torrenting, offering a fleet of P2P-friendly servers and split tunneling for fast speeds. Moreover, the company is located in the British Virgin Islands — a country where there are zero data retention laws — so you can rest assured that your data will never fall into the wrong hands.As far as cons go, Surfshark has a small server network compared to the other VPNs on this list with just over 1,700 of them spread throughout 63 countries.

Additional features: On the security front, CyberGhost users enjoy 256-bit encryption, an automatic kill switch, DNS and leak protection, and an uncompromising no-logging policy.





So, here's the thing: It's really hard to find a good VPN for Netflix . The streaming service cracks down hard on VPNs because they help people access the content that's geo-restricted by its licensing deals (a violation of its terms of service), and typically bans any providers it detects. As a result, VPNs that actually work with Netflix nowadays are quite rare — CyberGhost VPN is one of them.CyberGhost's massive global network of more than 6,300 servers includes dedicated streaming servers that have been optimized for speed and stability. (Not a Netflix person? That's chill — these servers can also help you bypass geo-restrictions on movies and shows on platforms like Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, ESPN, NBC, Hulu, and the BBC.) CyberGhost users have access to a split tunneling tool that keeps their connections fast, as well as a robust support site with step-by-step tutorials on how to connect to its Netflix servers on almost any device — an amazing resource for VPN newbies.On the security front, CyberGhost users enjoy 256-bit encryption, an automatic kill switch, DNS and leak protection, and an uncompromising no-logging policy.

Overall, though, PureVPN is a highly qualified provider, offering a split tunneling feature to conserve bandwidth, a kill switch, multiple logins for up to five devices, DNS leak protection, 256-bit encryption, and support for all security protocols.

It bears mentioning that the company came under fire in 2017 when it turned over a user's data logs to the FBI as part of a

Additional features: You can upgrade your PureVPN plan with a

PureVPN has a decent-sized network of more than 2,000 servers that are scattered across 180 locations in 140 different countries, including places in Asia, Central America, and Africa — which is more than most providers can say. Most impressively, its 150 servers in Africa are spread throughout 18 different countries there, which is basically unheard of as far as VPNs go; most of the other VPNs on this list have only one or two server locations on the whole continent. The only catch is that some of PureVPN's African servers are virtual, not physical, which sometimes (but not always) results in slower speeds.Overall, though, PureVPN is a highly qualified provider, offering a split tunneling feature to conserve bandwidth, a kill switch, multiple logins for up to five devices, DNS leak protection, 256-bit encryption, and support for all security protocols.It bears mentioning that the company came under fire in 2017 when it turned over a user's data logs to the FBI as part of a criminal investigation . But nowadays, they claim to abide by a no-log policy.You can upgrade your PureVPN plan with a dedicated IP address , a port forwarding tool , and IP whitelisting (each sold separately).

The peer-to-peer (P2P) mechanisms of

Offering up to six simultaneous connections with apps for Android, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android TV, and Linux as well as browser extensions, NordVPN keeps your connection secure with double AES 256-bit encryption, an automatic kill switch, and DNS leak protection on all your devices. (That's all on top of a strict no-logging policy, too.) It's also one of the few VPNs that lets you route your traffic between its own secure VPN servers and the Tor network, which creates an extra, extra secure connection and makes your online activities super difficult to track.

The downside to enabling all of these privacy features while you're torrenting on a NordVPN server is that they can seriously slow down your connection — but if you're comfortable sacrificing a little security for speed, you can always tinker with your settings and temporarily disable certain tools.

Additional features: NordVPN users on Windows, iOS, macOS, and Linux can enable a setting called

Note: NordVPN has announced that it suffered a breach in March 2018 when a hacker exploited an insecure remote management system at a Finnish data center from which the company was renting servers. We're keeping it on this list because we still think it's a strong contender in the VPN space. Click here to learn more. The peer-to-peer (P2P) mechanisms of torrenting make your IP address visible to everyone in your "swarm" — i.e., the group of people who have the other pieces of the file you're downloading.

It shouldn't replace your dedicated security software, to be sure, but it's still nice to have.

Just like the other VPNs on this list, PIA upholds a no-logging policy and offers unlimited bandwidth on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices. Plus, it can support an impressive 10 connections at once — that's double what most of its peers can handle.

But for all the perks PIA affords its users, it appears to be lacking reliable support for both Netflix and torrenting; according to reviews, its service is very hit or miss in those departments.

Additional features: In addition to its VPN service, PIA also offers a malware and ad blocker called MACE that prevents potentially malicious domains from tracking your online activity.

If you've been around the VPN block a few times, so to speak, you should take advantage of everything Private Internet Access has to offer. Boasting more than 3,300 servers in 46 countries, PIA (as it's commonly known) is a simple yet powerful VPN with a moddable interface. Among other adjustable settings, it also lets you customize your data encryption and authentication algorithms and change the configuration of its ports.Just like the other VPNs on this list, PIA upholds a no-logging policy and offers unlimited bandwidth on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices.

If you're still floating the idea of a VPN, Ivacy's price tag might be the thing that wins you over: At $1.16 a month with a five-year plan, it's the cheapest service on this list. Yet despite its low price, it doesn't skimp on security features like 256-bit encryption, a kill switch, and leak protection.

Additional features: For $1 and $1.99 a month, respectively, you can add port forwarding and a dedicated IP address to your Ivacy VPN plan.

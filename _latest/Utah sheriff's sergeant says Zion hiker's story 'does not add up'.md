description: > 
  Darrell Cashin from the Washington County Sheriffâ€™s Search and Rescue said parts of Courtier's story do not 'add up' and that there are 'discrepancies to it.Courtier's daughter said she deliberately stayed close to a water source and that she drank from it.'If we had found somebody in that condition with that kind of severe head injury, we would have at minimum called for a transport agency to check her out.'She was very disoriented as a result and thankfully ended up near a water source -- a river bed.'She thought her best chance of survival was to stay next to a water source.'

<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A Utah sheriff's sergeant has cast doubt on the story of a Zion hiker who claims to have survived for 12 days with no food and water after getting lost, and whose family has raised $12,000 for her on a GoFundMe account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Holly Courtier, 38, was suddenly found in the park on Sunday, 12 days after vanishing on a solo day trip.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her family has since claimed she survived on no food and that she stayed beside a river where she could drink water. Her daughter has also said she hit her head and that's why she couldn't go looking for help.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They have continued to ask for donations to the GoFundMe account, claiming she needs them for medical bills, but they have not specified what her injuries are.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Wednesday, Sgt. Darrell Cashin from the Washington County Sheriff&#8217;s Search and Rescue said parts of Courtier's story do not 'add up' and that there are 'discrepancies to it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said she couldn't have survived by drinking the water from the river where she was because it would have killed her, that she had no head injury like her family claimed, that she would have heard people calling her name and that there were questions over her 'decision' to enter the park.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She left California, he said, on a bus in the middle of the night without telling anyone where she was going.&#160;</p><img id="i-392726416e6262ef" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="336" width="306" alt="Sgt.

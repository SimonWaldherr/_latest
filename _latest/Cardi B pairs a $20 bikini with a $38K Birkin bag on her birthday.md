Cardi B knows how to party.

For her 28th birthday, the “WAP” singer threw a lavish bash in Las Vegas that included a cake shaped like gold bricks, strippers entertaining guests, a kiss with her estranged husband Offset, celebrity friends like Megan Thee Stallion and Kylie Jenner and more.

At the party, Cardi sported a corseted Grecian gown by Lena Berisha, but the star stripped down for the afterparty at her hotel suite, wearing nothing but a barely-there Fashion Nova bikini, white heels and an Hermès Birkin bag.

“My walk on dumb cause I’m still drunk,” she captioned a video strutting down the hallway.

The “No Tan Lines” PVC bikini ($20) gets its name from the clear straps that hold the top and bottoms together, creating a floating illusion. And while the style is currently sold out, Cardi’s Hermès purse — a rainbow-striped “Sunrise” Birkin — is available on 1stdibs for $38,450.

And following her party, the rapper has plenty of Hermès to go around; Fashion Nova gifted their most loyal customer and frequent collaborator with a mint green Kelly bag, while “WAP” music video star Kylie Jenner gave her a baby blue Birkin.

Talk about money bags.

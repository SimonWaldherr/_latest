On October 17 1982, a pair of Sea Harriers from 809 Naval Air Squadron roared off the pitching flight deck of HMS Illustrious, in the South Atlantic Ocean, and accelerated away from the carrier. Armed with heat-seeking Sidewinder missiles, they climbed to the north to intercept an incoming radar contact.

Since August, the eight-strong squadron, under the command of Lt Cdr Tim Gedge, had been responsible for the air defence of the Falkland Islands. Prior to that, Gedge’s squadron had fought in the campaign to recapture the islands from their Argentinian occupiers.

Outnumbered 10 to one, the 28-strong force of Sea Harriers had defied the odds to prevail against a skilled and courageous enemy. When the war was won in June after six weeks of fighting, the Fleet Air Arm’s jets had 23 kills to their credit, while not a single one had been lost in air combat.

Now, as Gedge and his wingman flew north over the vast expanse of ocean, he knew his tour of duty was coming to an end. Their job today was not to repel an Argentinian attack, but to welcome the first of their replacements and escort them into Port Stanley airfield. With the islands’ sole runway now repaired and extended, the carrier-based 809 jump-jets could finally pass the baton to the land-based F-4 Phantoms of the Royal Air Force. Over seven months on from the invasion, it would be a well-earned respite for the victorious pilots.

In April that year, when the British Task Force sailed south following Argentina’s invasion of the Falklands, many had dismissed their chances of success. The British faced the onset of formidable winter conditions – “the ice, the snow, the 60-foot seas, the constant Antarctic gales and the vulnerabilities of an 8,000-mile supply line,” as one sceptical American State Department official wrote in his diary. Not for the first time, however, the Harrier – the machine upon which British hopes of success were pinned – had been underestimated.

The Hawker Harrier was the world’s only successful vertical take-off and landing jet fighter. It was, in essence, the smallest possible aeroplane that could be built around its unique engine: the Rolls-Royce Pegasus. Unlike conventional jet engines, the thrust of the Pegasus was directed through four swivelling nozzles controlled by a lever in the cockpit. If the pilot wanted to rise or descend on a column of thrust, the nozzles were rotated so that the thrust was pointing down. By rotating them through 90 degrees to point backwards, the Pegasus then pushed the Harrier forwards in the same way as any other jet engine.

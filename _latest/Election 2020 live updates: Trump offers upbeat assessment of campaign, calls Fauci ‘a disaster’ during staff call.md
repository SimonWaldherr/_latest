<div><p></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Ahead of Judge Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s expected confirmation to the Supreme Court in the coming days, a coalition of Senate Republicans is offering up proposals intended to prevent Democrats from so-called &#8220;court-packing.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The symbolic measures are intended for Republicans to go on the offensive against Democrats as the issue of whether to expand the number of seats on the nine-member Supreme Court remains a delicate one in the final days of the presidential and Senate campaigns.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">A half-dozen senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) will unveil the proposals later Tuesday. The first is a constitutional amendment &#8212; which would require support of two-thirds of Congress and then ratification by three-fourths of individual states &#8212; barring the contraction or expansion of the number of seats on the Supreme Court.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The second would bar any proposals to change the size of the Supreme Court from even being considered in the Senate unless two-thirds of its members agree.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;Make no mistake, if Democrats win the election, they will end the filibuster and pack the Supreme Court, expanding the number of justices to advance their radical political agenda, entrenching their power for generations, and destroying the foundations of our democratic system,&#8221; Cruz said in a statement describing his proposals.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">He added: &#8220;We must take action before Election Day to safeguard the Supreme Court and the constitutional liberties that hang in the balance.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Endorsing the measure are three Senate Republicans in competitive contests in November &#8212; Sens. Thom Tillis (N.C.), Martha McSally (Ariz.) and Kelly Loeffler (Ga.) &#8212; who have warned of court-packing should Democrats win the White House and retake the Senate majority in November.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;For the last few years, Democrats have made no secret of their desire to see a radical, socialist agenda imposed on the American people,&#8221; said Tillis, who along with Cruz sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. &#8220;Unable to implement their job-killing plans through the Democratic process, they&#8217;ve decided they&#8217;ll simply impose it on the American people through the Supreme Court.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Barrett&#8217;s nomination is expected to clear the Judiciary Committee on Thursday afternoon, and she could be confirmed by the full Senate as early as Oct. 26.</p></div>

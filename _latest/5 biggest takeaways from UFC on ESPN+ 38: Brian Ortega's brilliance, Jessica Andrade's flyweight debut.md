<div><p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/brian-ortega">Brian Ortega</a> reenforced the notion that &#8220;ring rust&#8221; doesn&#8217;t apply to all with the most impressive performance of his career against Chan Sung Jung. Sure, Ortega has scored more visually appealing knockouts and submission, but for him to come back from nearly two years away and <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/10/ufc-espn-plus-38-results-brian-ortega-dominant-decision-long-layoff-chan-sung-jung-korean-zombie">pitch a shutout on the scorecards</a>? That says a lot more about him.</p>
<p>Although his grappling was viewed as his best path to victory in this fight, it wasn&#8217;t even needed. &#8220;T-City&#8221; had his way on the feet for all five rounds, dropping and cutting Jung open in a 25-minute effort that showed he&#8217;s not the fighter we saw lose to Max Holloway in a <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2018/12/ufc-231-results-max-holloway-overwhelms-brian-ortega-defends-title">lopsided title-fight loss</a> at UFC 231 in December 2018.</p>
<p>UFC president Dana White designated Ortega vs. Jung as a title eliminator coming in. There were some questions if Ortega would be worthy just one fight removed of a shot at gold, but he made his point loud and clear. If Holloway were still champion it would be a different story, but the landscape has altered with Volkanovski at the top of the mountain, and it seems clear at this point that version 2.0 of Ortega should be challenging for a title next time out.</p>

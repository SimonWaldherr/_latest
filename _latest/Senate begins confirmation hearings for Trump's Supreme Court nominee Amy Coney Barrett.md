Senators sport masks at Barrett hearing

As Senate Judiciary members arrived for Judge Amy Coney Barrett's first day of confirmation hearings, most were clad in disposable masks, including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Oct. 2.

As he arrived, Lee did not respond when reporters asked if he had been tested for COVID-19 on Monday. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., was seen wearing his mask around his neck and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. – who has refused to say whether he has been tested for the virus – removed his mask to speak, as did ranking Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.

Many have expressed concern about the safety of Feinstein, 87, and other older members of the committee who are considered at high risk from the virus such as Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is also 87. Three GOP senators – including committee members Lee and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina – tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month.

Barrett and her family entered wearing tight-fitting cloth masks. Barrett continued to wear her mask as she listened to Graham and Feinstein's opening statements.

Barrett arrives for confirmation hearing

Judge Amy Coney Barrett arrived on Capitol Hill on Monday for the first day of her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her seven children and husband are all in the audience, all wearing face masks, according to ABC News' Trish Turner.

She will be presenting her opening statement, where she is set to say, "courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life."

Protesters gather outside during Barrett hearing

Activists opposing the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court gathered in front of the Supreme Court and Senate office buildings Monday morning, as the Senate began confirmation hearings for Barrett take place.

Clad in Hazmat suits and gas masks, protestors held signs reading “Hazard COVID” and “No COVID Test No Hearing.” The protests were organized in part by the Center for Popular Democracy Action, a progressive advocacy group.

“If Senate leadership forces a nominee before the next congress and president are installed, it would deprive the people of their voice and further destabilize a nation already gripped by crisis,” Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director at CPD Action, said in a statement.

Conservative groups supporting Barrett’s nomination to the court were also present, chanting “law and order” as progressives chanted in front of the Senate Hart Building.

Senate to begin confirmation hearings for Barrett

WASHINGTON – The Senate began confirmation hearings Monday for President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett as Republicans aim to confirm her before Election Day.

Monday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is the first of four days of confirmation hearings. All 22 senators on the panel will give opening 10-minute statements, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Barrett will be introduced by Indiana's two Republican senators Todd Young and Mike Braun, and former Notre Dame Professor Patricia O'Hara, one of Barrett's mentors. The judge will also deliver her own opening statement.

"Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life," Barrett says in her planned remarks. "The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the People. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try."

Don't expect a vote on Barrett this week. The committee won’t vote until after it holds Barrett’s nomination for one week, a common practice by the panel. The committee vote is expected around Oct. 22 and is likely to split along party lines, 12-10. Then her nomination will go to the full Senate, where she'll need at least a majority to be confirmed to the high court.

Republicans are determined to advance Barrett's confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at a Friday event in Kentucky "the first item of priority in the Senate is the Supreme Court."

Democrats have called for the nomination to be postponed until after the election but acknowledge they neither have the votes to delay the hearing, nor do they have the votes to block Barrett from ultimately being confirmed to the high court. Instead, they aim to highlight parts of Barrett's record they view as problematic, especially with regards to health care.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat and a member of the committee, said Sunday on "Meet the Press" Barrett had been sent "on assignment" by Trump to the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act and to rule on election-related cases.

Democrats plan to avoid asking about Barrett's personal background and beliefs, however. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, also a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" Barrett's religion was "immaterial" to her confirmation. Hirono was instead "totally focused" on Barrett's views regarding the Affordable Care Act, she said.

Democratic lawmakers have also expressed concerns about safety at the hearing as multiple Republican senators tested positive for COVID-19 this month. Congress does not have a COVID-19 testing program.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Friday in a letter to Graham that the hearing posed "serious risks" and they urged him against "unsafely moving forward with these hearings while no clear testing regime is in place to ensure that they do not become another super-spreader of this deadly virus."

Harris and Leahy have since said they would take part in the hearings remotely in the absence of a standardized COVID-19 testing program in the Senate.

Two of the panel's members, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, announced positive tests for COVID-19 on Oct. 2 and went into quarantine, though both senators indicated they would attend the hearings either virtually or in-person.

Graham has said the hearings would be conducted "safely," limits will be placed on the number of people in the hearing room, and the hearing itself has been moved to a larger room.

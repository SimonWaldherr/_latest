WASHINGTON – Their face-to-face debate canceled, President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will instead hold dueling town halls Thursday on competing television networks.

NBC announced Wednesday it will host a Trump town hall at 8 p.m. EDT on Thursday – the same time at which ABC will be hosting a similar event with Biden in Philadelphia.

The Trump event will be in Miami, which was supposed to be the site of the debate between the two candidates. That debate was canceled after Trump refused to participate once it was moved to a virtual format because of Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis. The Commission on Presidential Debates, given the threat of contagion from Trump, called for a virtual debate by video. Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate and the parties were unable to agree on an alternate format.

The debate fell apart at a time when Trump is trailing Biden in some polls by double digits.

Now Trump will meet with "a group of Florida voters on critical issues impacting their vote less than three weeks before Election Day," NBC said in announcing its town hall.

The event to be held just two weeks after Trump tested positive for COVID-19 "will take place outdoors at the Pérez Art Museum Miami in accordance with guidelines set forth by health officials and consistent with all government regulations," NBC said.

The network also released a statement by Dr. Clifford Lane, clinical director at the National Institutes of Health, saying that he and infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci have reviewed the president's case and cleared him for the event.

The doctors concluded “with a high degree of confidence” that Trump is “not shedding infectious virus," NBC said.

Trump, moderator Savannah Guthrie, and the crowd will be socially distanced.

In announcing its Biden town hall last week, ABC said the event will be held "in accordance with state and local government health and safety regulations, as well as guidelines set forward by health officials."

It’s over for Jonah Hill and fiancée Gianna Santos.

The couple have broken up a little over a year after getting engaged, People reported on Monday. The split is said to be amicable.

Hill, 36, was spotted arriving at a friend’s house in Santa Monica, Calif., after news of his split broke.

A rep for Hill didn’t immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.

Page Six exclusively revealed in September 2019 that the “Wolf of Wall Street” star had proposed to Santos.

Santos currently works as a content manager at beauty startup Violet Grey and previously was the head stylist and producer at hip fashion brand KITH.

Hill and his younger sister, actress Beanie Feldstein, are still following Santos on Instagram.

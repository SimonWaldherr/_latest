After a summer of love for our gardens, it’s all too easy to fear that we will now have to retreat indoors as the leaves turn and temperatures drop. But here is the good news: the autumn garden, according to Charlie Hart, a gardening writer and father of five, is as much of a sanctuary as its summer predecessor: a place to hang out as a family but also to get busy with a pair of gardening gloves. “People always say there’s nothing to do in the garden, but autumn and winter are the most profitable times for weeding, planting and tidying,” he says.

With further lockdowns almost inevitable, it is ­reassuring to hear that Hart insists our gardens can be a useful and uplifting extension of our living space throughout this socially distanced autumn. All that’s required to bring the indoors outside is an outdoorsy – or friluftsliv – mindset. Friluftsliv, the Swedish for “open air”, encompasses all the many things that can be enjoyed outside on a daily basis: exercise, cooking and eating, work and relaxation.

It’s a modus operandi that is hugely satisfying, explains garden designer Jo Thompson, but it only works if you’re dressed for the weather – you need to get the hang of onion ­layering: thermal base layers and breathable, waterproof outerwear. “M&S does perfectly good thermal long-sleeve vests and long johns for being outside in all weathers,” says Thompson. For outerwear, look to Swedish brands such as polarnopyret.co.uk and ­didriksons.com.

Of course, not all children and teens will like the sound of friluftsliv. On a cold rainy day, Hart’s wife Sybilla, a journalist, admits that she’s lucky if she gets her eldest son, Isaac, aged 13, outside for 10 minutes.

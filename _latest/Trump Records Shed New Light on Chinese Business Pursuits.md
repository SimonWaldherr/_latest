<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">China continues to be an issue in the 2020 presidential campaign, from the president&#8217;s trade war to his barbs over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. His campaign has tried to portray Mr. Biden as a &#8220;puppet&#8221; of China who, as vice president, misread the dangers posed by its growing power. Mr. Trump has also sought to tar his opponent with overblown or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/us/politics/hunter-biden-china.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share" title="">unsubstantiated assertions</a> about Hunter Biden&#8217;s business dealings there while his father was in office.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;He&#8217;s like a vacuum cleaner &#8212; he follows his father around collecting,&#8221; Mr. Trump said recently, referring to Mr. Biden&#8217;s son. &#8220;What a disgrace. It&#8217;s a crime family.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In a misleading claim amplified by surrogates like his son Donald Trump Jr. and his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president has said the younger Mr. Biden &#8220;walked out of China&#8221; with $1.5 billion after accompanying his father on an official trip in 2013. Numerous <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-know-about-hunter-bidens-dealings-in-china-11570181403" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news articles</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/10/trumps-claims-about-hunter-biden-in-china/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fact-checking sites</a> have explained that the huge figure was actually a fund-raising goal set by an investment firm in which Hunter Biden obtained a 10 percent stake after his father left office. The firm did receive financial backing from a large state-controlled bank, but it is not clear the fund-raising target was ever met, and there is no evidence Hunter Biden received a large personal payout.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As for the former vice president, his public financial disclosures, along with the income tax returns he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://joebiden.com/financial-disclosure/#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voluntarily released</a>, show no income or business dealings of his own in China. However, there is ample evidence of Mr. Trump&#8217;s efforts to join the myriad American firms that have long done business there &#8212; and the tax records for him and his companies that were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html" title="">obtained by The Times</a> offer new details about them.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As with Russia, where he explored hotel and tower projects in Moscow without success, Mr. Trump has long sought a licensing deal in China. His efforts go at least as far back as 2006, when he filed trademark applications in Hong Kong and the mainland. Many Chinese<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/business/trump-china-trademarks.html" title=""> government approvals</a> came after he became president. (The president&#8217;s daughter Ivanka Trump also won Chinese <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/business/ivanka-trump-china-trademarks.html" title="">trademark approvals</a> for her personal business after she joined the White House staff.)</p></div>

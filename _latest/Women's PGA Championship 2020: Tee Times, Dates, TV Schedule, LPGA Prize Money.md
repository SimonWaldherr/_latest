Having fallen just short in the ANA Inspiration, Nelly Korda heads to Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, on a mission as the 2020 Women's PGA Championship prepares to tee off.

Korda was one of three golfers tied for the lead in the ANA Inspiration as the final round concluded. A birdie on the first playoff hole gave Mirim Lee the title. Lee and Korda will be two of the top contenders for the next major championship on the schedule.

The Women's PGA Championship will begin Thursday at 8:10 a.m. ET. The trio of Esther Henseleit, Ellen Ceresko and Jing Yan will start at No. 1 while Wichanee Meechai, Kristy McPherson and Jennifer Borocz take to the No. 10 tee.

When: Oct. 8-11

Watch: Golf Channel, NBC Sports, NBCSports.com

Golf Channel and NBC are splitting the television coverage over the four days. The former will carry the bulk of the tournament, with the latter airing the conclusion of the third and fourth rounds.

Thursday, Oct. 8: 1-5 p.m., Golf Channel

Friday, Oct. 9: 1-5 p.m. ET, Golf Channel

Saturday, Oct. 10: 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET Golf Channel; 12-3 p.m. ET, NBC

Sunday, Oct. 11: 10 a.m.-12 p.m. ET, Golf Channel; 12-2 p.m. ET, NBC

A total of $4.3 million will be on the line at Aronimink, an increase of $450,000 from last year's purse. It's also the third-biggest payout of the season, narrowly trailing the AIG Women's Open ($4.5 million) and falling behind the upcoming U.S. Women's Open ($5.5 million).

Korda is looking for her first major championship victory, and she remains winless over the abbreviated 2020 LPGA Tour calendar. She has finished in the top five in each of her last three tournaments, though, so this could be when the 22-year-old breaks through.

Perhaps Danielle Kang can add to what has already been a successful year. Her results haven't been great of late, though. She has one top-10 finish since notching back-to-back wins in the LPGA Drive On Championship and Marathon LPGA Classic in August.

Surely the 27-year-old's luck has to turn around at some point.

Kang is part of arguably the most interesting group to follow for the first two rounds. She's joined by 2016 Women's PGA Championship winner Brooke Henderson and reigning champion Hannah Green. The trio will tee off at 1:07 p.m. ET on Thursday and 8:27 a.m. ET on Friday.

It's a pretty safe bet that at least one of Kang, Henderson or Green should be hanging around the top of the leaderboard for the majority of the tournament.

  Opinion: Before Tua parade starts, Miami Dolphins' Ryan Fitzpatrick deserves to be celebrated 
description: > 
  Or maybe it’s simply this: Fitz being Fitz.Whatever it is, the Miami Dolphins and their fans need to take a timeout from the coronation of The Tua Era today to tip their caps to Ryan Fitzpatrick.And you probably can assume there was a big part of him that was happy for Tua.That’s what I thought I might hear, back when I didn’t know Fitz.Fitzpatrick just led the Dolphins to two lopsided victories and is playing some of the best ball.

But you can bet he handled it like a pro.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And you probably can assume there was a big part of him that was happy for Tua.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Anything else, and he wouldn&#8217;t be the Fitz we&#8217;ve come to know this past year and a half.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">MORE:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/dolphins/2020/10/21/tua-tagovailoa-starting-quarterback-miami-dolphins-brian-flores/6004541002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Miami Dolphins' Brian Flores says starting Tua Tagovailoa &#8216;best thing for the team'</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">OPINION:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/dolphins/2020/10/20/tua-tagovailoa-could-usher-new-era-miami-dolphins-history/5994134002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Tua Time is here, and Tagovailoa could usher in new era for Dolphins</a></p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick (14) and head coach Brian Flores, left, leave the field after an NFL football game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Thursday, Sept. 24, 2020, in Jacksonville, Fla."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">My first masterclass in Fitz being Fitz came during training camp last year, when we sat down in the lobby of the training facility for a major profile I wrote even though there was no certainty he would win the starting job.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fitz was entering his 15th NFL season at the time, but with his eighth NFL franchise. Some players &#8212; perhaps most &#8212; would lament their inability to set down roots, or that their resume lacked even one playoff appearance.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That&#8217;s what I thought I might hear, back when I didn&#8217;t know Fitz.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">What I instead heard was a man who couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for the opportunities he has had coming out of that football factory, Harvard. A man who has seven kids born in seven states and considers it an adventure. A man who knows that whatever road game is next on the schedule, he can be certain he&#8217;ll run into old friends delighted to see him again.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Who looks at a 22-year-old kid nipping at his heels, possibly taking his last job in this league, and not only helps the kid, but relishes doing so? Who takes comfort in feeling he&#8217;ll be &#8220;tied into him and the success that he&#8217;ll have&#8221; in the years to come?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That&#8217;s Fitz.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Though there couldn&#8217;t be any doubt that the Dolphins had to give Tagovailoa an extended look sooner or later, it&#8217;s ironic that now&#8217;s that time. Fitzpatrick just led the Dolphins to two lopsided victories and is playing some of the best ball. His passer rating of 95.0 is better than any of his NFL seasons except two, and given that two of his best statistical seasons have come in the past three years, it might not automatic that this will be his last NFL go-round, even with his 38th birthday a few weeks away.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Here&#8217;s a list for you: Philip Rivers. Matthew Stafford. Kirk Cousins. Joe Burrow. Cam Newton. Nick Foles. Carson Wentz. They all have worse passer ratings than Fitzpatrick, whose completion percentage (70.1) ranks fifth in the NFL and whose QBR (82.5) is seventh.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The fact that Fitzpatrick has played well enough to put the Dolphins in position to challenge for a playoff berth, and that he was the team MVP during that tumultuous transition in 2019, speaks volumes. If he wants to play in 2021, there should be a market, and if not, he&#8217;d make an outstanding quarterback whisperer.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fitz will go down as one of the endearing characters to ever wear a Dolphins uniform. He once assured reporters that when he reported to camp, the beard would be flowing &#8220;to full effect.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Before playing Jacksonville he got into a &#8220;feud&#8221; with Jaguars quarterback Gardner Minshew that became billed as The Beard vs. The &#8217;Stache. All you needed to know about that was on your TV screen when the quarterbacks shared a good laugh as the teams met at midfield postgame. Who stays mad at Fitz?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fitzpatrick had everybody cracking up that time he pointed out how tough it was to keep his weight reasonable because one of his kids had a birthday, which meant cake, followed by another and another and another.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;That&#8217;s a tough stretch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s cake six out of 10 or 11 days.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Those are Fitz moments, for sure, but so too is something he said Aug. 1 when talking about Tua.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I know that I am the placeholder and we&#8217;ve already had that conversation,&#8221; Fitzpatrick said. &#8220;I told him I&#8217;m going to do the best I can to lead this team and to win football games when I&#8217;m out there and whenever it is that Tua gets his chance, whether it&#8217;s early or late or whenever it is, I&#8217;m going to be his biggest cheerleader.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It&#8217;s no wonder Fitzpatrick enjoys the respect he does in his locker room.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The same level of respect he deserves from Dolphins fans, too.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/nfl/dolphins/2020/10/21/miami-dolphins-starting-quarterbacks-since-dan-marino-retired/6002408002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

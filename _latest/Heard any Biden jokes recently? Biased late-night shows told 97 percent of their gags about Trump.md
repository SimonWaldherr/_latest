  Heard any Biden jokes recently? Biased late-night shows told 97 percent of their gags about Trump 
description: > 
  A survey of late-night shows has found that in September two of the main U.S. hosts cracked jokes almost exclusively at the expense of Donald Trump.Ninety seven per cent of the jokes Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon told about the candidates in September targeted Trump, a study released on Monday found.The researchers found 455 jokes about Trump and 14 about Democrat Joe Biden, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University.'I think they will find a way to keep making jokes about Trump, even after he leaves office,' Lichter said.In 2001, late-night comedians made former president Bill Clinton the subject of more jokes than his successor, George W. Bush, Lichter said.

Pub and restaurant-goers staged an impromptu cricket match on a high street in south London after venues were forced to close at 10pm in line with the government’s coronavirus restrictions.

Video of the game, which played out on Rye Lane in Peckham, was widely shared on Twitter. A large crowd could be seen gathering near Peckham Rye train station to watch.

James Jones, a documentary maker who caught the game on video, said impromptu cricket matches had become a regular feature of the street since it was closed in July by Southwark Council to allow more space for social distancing for shoppers, cyclists and pedestrians.

He told The Independent: “I think people have been playing cricket outside Khan’s on Rye Lane occasionally since the street was pedestrianised.

“Last night it coincided with everyone being kicked out of the pubs and bars at 10pm so it grew into a larger crowd.

"The atmosphere was very sweet and exuberant. I’ll leave it to other people to debate the rights and wrongs but it was a joyful moment at a time when we all need a bit of joy in our lives!”

The government has faced pressure to review the 10pm curfew, which came into force at the end of September.

There have been claims that the policy was not based on robust evidence, as well as suggestions that it might be counterproductive by triggering mass street parties in major cities.

It comes as Matt Hancock, the health secretary, denied claims that he broke the government's Covid drinking curfew.

The Cabinet minister's spokesman insisted allegations Mr Hancock stayed drinking in a Commons bar beyond 10pm were untrue.

US president Donald Trump in Iowa on Wednesday

Donald Trump continues to trail his presidential challenger Joe Biden by as much as 17 points in the national polls and acknowledged his concern during his latest rally appearance in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday night, telling his loyal crowd: "For me to only be up six [in Iowa], I'm a little bit concerned, I'll tell you that."

In a further sign of his desperation, the president later tweeted an astonishing plea to voters in the solidly-Democratic state of California, asking them “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?” in voting for him.

That came as Facebook and Twitter censored a New York Post article that claimed a connection between the former vice president and his son Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine, a story the Biden camp have hotly refuted but which has inspired fresh gloating from Trump, who called the emails it concerns “Smoking Gun” evidence of a corruption.

The story, dismissed by many commentators as “highly sketchy”, originates in emails taken from a laptop that reportedly belonged to Hunter Biden and which was retreived from a Delaware repair shop and handed over to the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid by Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, following a tip-off from Steve Bannon (hmmm…) It claims to prove that Biden’s younger son did introduce his father, then US vice president, to his then-bosses at the Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2015 at a time when the Obama administration was pressing Kiev to remove a prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, whom it accused of being corrupt.

Consulting firms are still recruiting for interns during the coronavirus pandemic.

Bain & Co. and Boston Consulting Group are among the four leading consultancies that have extended full-time offers to this year's virtual internship class.

According to a 2020 salaries report by Management Consulted, a careers resource platform that helps graduates land consulting jobs, a student pursuing an MBA degree can earn up to $32,000 in 10 weeks interning at a consulting firm.

Drawing from Management Consulted's data, Business Insider compiled a ranked list of the eight consulting firms that offer more than $30,000 in compensation for MBA interns.

The consultancies also shared how they're approaching internship programs differently in response to the pandemic, and if students will be compensated differently.

Management consulting is one of the most competitive fields to break into, but one way to get your foot in the door and guarantee a spot after business school, is through a summer internship.

The consulting industry is among the top two fields that turn internships into full-time positions, as firms have a conversion rate of about 38%, according to a 2017 LinkedIn report. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, firms are also showing a greater commitment to summer interns, as leading consultancies like McKinsey, Bain & C0., and PwC extended full-time offers to more 1,500 students before their summer programs even started.

Business Insider's analysis of 2019 and 2020 salary reports by Management Consulted, a careers resource company that helps graduates land consulting jobs, suggested that top-tier firms have been increasing their hourly rates for both MBA interns and offering tuition reimbursements for their retained talent. Accenture Strategy, for example, added a $50,000 tuition reimbursement after taxes to their compensation package this year.

"They're looking to fill their pipeline of future leaders, but there's a limited number of top talent â€” that's what makes it tough," said Namaan Mian, director of operations at Management Consulted. "That's why we're seeing salaries rise. That's why we're seeing the recruiting timelines move up earlier and earlier."

Firms adopted a virtual recruitment cycle during the pandemic, and they will continue to recruit online for this upcoming year. Internships are usually 8 to 12 weeks long from early June through the second week of August. Nevertheless, some programs were delayed or cut short this year at consultancies like PwC, Accenture, and Deloitte.

We've compiled a list of consulting firms that offer the highest internship salaries for MBA students. The compensation listed below is what you would earn in a 10-week internship, calculated based on the hourly rates provided in 2020.

It's important to note that this is the most recently available data on compensation, and that internship pay might change in 2021 as a result of the pandemic. Firms are recruiting for interns now, but application deadlines differ, depending on the campuses, country, and position that students would be applying from.

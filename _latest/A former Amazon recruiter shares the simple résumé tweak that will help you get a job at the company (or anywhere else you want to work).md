<li><strong>Instead, use hard numbers to demonstrate how you succeeded in previous roles.&#160;</strong></li>
<li><strong>There are probably also a few more things that your r&#233;sum&#233; would be better off without, like your full mailing address and a list of references.&#160;</strong></li>

<p>Celeste Joy Diaz, a former recruiting manager for university programs at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/amazon">Amazon</a>, said&#160;there is one big thing that can irk recruiters during the application process: namedropping your place of employment, without explaining what you did there.</p><p>"Titles are great, but we want to understand what was the project you owned, what was the scope of a project, and what did you accomplish," Diaz, who currently works as a recruiter for Netflix, previously told Business Insider.</p><p>Simply stating in your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/resume">r&#233;sum&#233;</a>&#160;that you worked at Google, The New York Times, or some other name-brand company is impressive, but it doesn't really communicate what you did with that opportunity.&#160;</p><p>That doesn't just apply to recruiters at Amazon, either. Career experts across the board have named lack of explanation as one of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-resume-mistake-makes-recruiters-cringe-2018-2">the biggest mistakes</a> that applicants make on their r&#233;sum&#233;s.</p><p>"Lack of measurements and results in the file is my biggest r&#233;sum&#233; pet peeve," <a href="http://www.careerimpressions.ca/">executive r&#233;sum&#233; writer and career strategist</a> Adrienne Tom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-resume-mistake-makes-recruiters-cringe-2018-2">previously told Business Insider</a>. "Without any measurements of success, the file is lacking proof of skill."</p><p>So, expand upon what you did in that job that brought value &#8212; whether that's an amount of revenue you produced, projects you led, or how you excelled in your monthly goals. Including the numbers that back up your success is key,&#160;Tina Nicolai, executive career coach and founder of <a href="http://www.resumewritersink.com/">R&#233;sum&#233; Writers' Ink</a>, previously <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-always-include-on-your-resume-2016-1">told Business Insider</a>.</p><p>Be as specific as possible. Write, "Helped grow revenue by 500% to $1 million in 12 month period by doing X" instead of "Helped grow revenue," Nicolai said.</p><p>"Employers need numbers to be able to fully evaluate the scope of your bandwidth," Nicolai said. "No position is exempt from measuring results.&#160;And metrics help employers determine if a person is capable of leading a team, managing clients, or growing the business."</p>

<p>But your job isn't done once you've fully explained your job accomplishments &#8211; you should also be careful to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dont-put-these-things-on-your-resume-2015-75">make your r&#233;sum&#233; as clear and succinct as possible</a>. That means nixing things that aren't necessary, like your full mailing address, multiple phone numbers, and references. You should also be careful to make sure your r&#233;sum&#233; is consistently formatted.&#160;</p><p>This extends to job interviews as well, Diaz said. She recommended discussing your previous roles with other people, so you can practice giving concrete examples of your achievements and explaining what your job meant beyond the title and the company.&#160;</p><p>"People might not take the time to think about the impact of the work they've done," Diaz said. "I want to understand scope of impact more than just job titles."</p><p>Sherin Shibu contributed to an earlier version of this post.&#160;</p>

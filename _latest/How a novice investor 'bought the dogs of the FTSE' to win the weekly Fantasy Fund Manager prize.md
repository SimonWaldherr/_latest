The biggest share price falls are often followed by the sharpest recoveries. Alex Roberts, a 35-year-old civil servant from Wirral, believed this when he put all his chips in the Daily Telegraph’s Fantasy Fund Manager game on companies hardest hit by lockdown. They had the greatest potential to rebound, he thought.

“I had to take a risk to regain some ground and knew that the most beaten-up stocks could bounce back sharply, even though there was a risk they could fall further,” he said.

Mr Roberts bought names in sectors that faced the most disruption, from Hammerson, the shopping centre operator, to Cineworld, the cinema chain, and Aston Martin, the beleaguered carmaker.

The result was stunning and, in his own words, a bit lucky. His fund, Wally Waffers, climbed by 17pc in a week from £91,336 to £106,850, taking him close to the top 1,000 players. Cineworld was the star of his portfolio, gaining 45pc in a week.

“I read about the issues that these companies were facing, but decided that the selling had gone too far. When Hammerson disclosed that a director had bought shares, I thought it was time to have a punt on it. It’s fantasy money, so it’s best to take a gamble. It was definitely a high-risk, high-reward move.”

Mr Roberts is a novice investor but knows enough not to deploy this strategy with his real-life savings. Instead, he prefers active and passive funds that spread risk across a basket of stocks so that a single company doing poorly cannot wipe out his investments.

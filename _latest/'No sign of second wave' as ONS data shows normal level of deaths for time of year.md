  'No sign of second wave' as ONS data shows normal level of deaths for time of year 
description: > 
  Although Covid deaths rose to 438 for the week ending October 9 – an increase of 36 per cent from the previous week, when the figure stood at 321 – overall deaths rose just 143 above the five-year average.There were also 19 fewer overall deaths than in the same week last year.Researchers also found there would usually be around 1,600 weekly deaths from flu and pneumonia for the same week.Deaths from coronavirus, flu and pneumonia are currently running at 1,621, suggesting there is virtually no increase in expected respiratory deaths.For example, between 2010 and 2019 the number of deaths for the week ending October 9 rose from 9,281 to 9,973 – about 70 extra deaths a year.

<div><p>There is no sign of&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/20/uk-cases-covid-19-deaths-coronavirus-numbers-today/">a second coronavirus wave</a>, experts have said as new Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed that deaths are just 1.5 per cent above the five-year average and tracking on a normal trajectory for the time of year.</p>
<p>Although Covid deaths rose to 438 for the week ending October 9 &#8211; an increase of 36 per cent from the previous week, when the figure stood at&#160;321 &#8211; overall deaths rose just 143 above&#160;the five-year average.&#160; There were also 19 fewer overall deaths than in the same week last year.</p>
<p>Experts at Oxford University said the number would have to get to 1,200 deaths above the norm before it would usually be considered "excess" above the expected variation in the data.</p>
<p>Researchers also found there would usually be around 1,600 weekly <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/08/covid-19-could-deadly-flu-pneumonia-combined-figures-suggest/">deaths from flu and pneumonia</a> for the same week. Deaths from coronavirus, flu and pneumonia are currently running at 1,621, suggesting there is virtually no increase in expected respiratory deaths.</p>
<p>The ONS figures also do not factor in the UK's&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/18/patients-must-not-delay-visits-nhs-second-wave-pandemic-urge/">growing and ageing population</a>, which would be expected to increase the number of deaths over time and which are likely to cancel out at least some of the increase.</p>
<p>For example, between 2010 and 2019 the number of deaths for the week ending October 9 rose from 9,281 to 9,973 &#8211; about 70 extra deaths a year.&#160;</p>

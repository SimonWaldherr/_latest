Coronavirus cases in the US will continue to rise as America lacks the Will-Power to extinguish Covid19.

An effective response to a disaster, pandemic, or crisis requires "all hands on deck."

An attentive, decisive leader with clear communication can inspire a country to work together to defeat a common enemy, the virus.

Even seven months into this pandemic, the US is failing to contain the coronavirus.

New cases are once again on the rise. According to the Johns Hopkins University Resource Center, the US has had over 7 million coronavirus cases and over 210,000 deaths since the first case of COVID-19 in the US.

Schools and institutions of higher learning have opened up across the country and there will be mixing of various student populations culminating increased coronavirus spread among each other, faculty, staff, family members, communities, and the nation at large.

Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics, in collaboration with Children's Hospital Association, published data of a sharp increase in US COVID-19 cases in children. The total cases of COVID-19 in children in the US since the beginning of the pandemic is now over 600,000 and rising.

The debates over whether to wear masks and face coverings, when schools should open, why and how, have become one of the major topics around the country. In fact, a predictable surprise occurred recently as some school systems in Georgia, Indiana and Mississippi reported cases of coronavirus spread among students and faculty, with some students requiring quarantine and school closure. This is not just a dilemma for the schools, but a nightmare for the entire country.

Over the past several months, the coronavirus pandemic has uncovered some deeply troubling trends in the US. It has exposed a fragile and overburdened public health system while magnifying the underlying health, racial, and socioeconomic disparities that have long existed. The virus has also illuminated areas of weakness in our collective US pandemic response and desire to rid this ubiquitous enemy.

The past few decades have demonstrated an increasing assault on science; from global warming as a hoax to anti-vaxxers, and today, with the anti-public health stance amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, a 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor survey showed that 73% of adults worldwide say they trust a doctor or nurse most, far more than information from family and friends, traditional healers, religious leaders and celebrities.

Similarly, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found 84% trust the information they get from public health experts, and Pew found that 83% have confidence in Public health officials at the CDC, to do a good job of responding to the coronavirus outbreak. It is clear that the public trusts health experts, however, push back on public health recommendations have emanated mostly from the actions and inactions of the leader of the free world, President Donald Trump.

Keep politics out of science

There are two separate, unrelated issues that have become intertwined during the pandemic: science and politics. And this conflation is making our pandemic response even worse.

Take masks for example. In addition to recommendations from the WHO and the CDC on masking, several recent studies have made the science of the effectiveness of masking clear.

Yet in April, despite the CDC's guidance on masks, President Trump said he would not wear a mask and recommended that people should do what they want regarding wearing masks and face coverings at his Tulsa, Oklahoma rally.

Subsequently, recent coronavirus polling data from Gallup revealed that 61% of Democrats vs 24% of Republicans reported "wearing face masks in public always" and a similar divide was noted in a recent Axios-Ipsos poll with 65% democrats vs 35% republicans reporting constant mask wearing.

It is clear from the science that masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19.. Your decision to care for your neighbor and reduce coronavirus spread by wearing a mask or face covering should not be based on your political affiliation.

Better leadership and clear, consistent messaging

Confusing and contradictory messages from the president regarding the risks of COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine, while ignoring recommendations of his coronavirus taskforce (especially regarding mask-wearing) supplanted many public health messages. Key decisions on the pandemic response were left to states and localities to "choose their destiny". Some governors and mayors stepped up, but without clear guidance or marching orders from the top, the piecemeal responses across the nation have been inadequate.

Recently, Dr. Deborah Birx reportedly wished the US had a "more stringent lockdown in place at the beginning of the pandemic like Italy". Frankly, while there is no appetite for such draconian measures in the US, Dr. Birx should have been adamant about such lockdowns in the beginning. It is, however, appreciated that members of the coronavirus task force are beginning to speak up candidly and unmuzzled.

Time to sacrifice our leisure

America is a social country with fun past times, and we love our sports. In order to optimize our experiences as social animals, we inevitably require congregating. But at what risk? Consider that 54% of people report being worried about lack of social distancing in their local area per a recent Gallup poll. Mitigation strategies, such as avoiding congregating or attending mass gatherings, are being refuted, citing personal rights.

According to YouGov, an international research data and analytics group, 41% of Americans say that the First Amendment is the most important and well known Amendment in the Bill of Rights. Of course, the First Amendment rights are crucial to the foundation of this country. However, when that right infringes upon another's (in this case, the public good as evidenced by science), we must reconsider that notion or at least in the context of a pandemic resulting in an increased morbidity, mortality, and unknown long term outcomes and effects.

Our civil liberties, myopic view of COVID-19, politics, divisiveness, disdain for science, reluctance to sacrifice certain things for a short period of time for a greater goal may be our "Achilles heel," undermining our ultimate willpower to defeat the coronavirus. If we don't get this right, there will be chaos and ultimately, a threat to national security. Historically, America loves the "underdog".

We unite, and in one voice, root for team USA in the Olympics; for our US military soldiers on frontlines at war; and for Bobby Boucher in the movie "Water Boy." The time is now. COVID-19 is here to stay. Vaccines and therapeutics aside, this is a marathon not a sprint. America get your act together, crush the enemy (COVID-19), and let us get to the other side of our "new normal" with health equity, health security, racial, and socio-economic justice, in a thriving nation that resumes and earns its permanent place as the number 1 country in the world. I've been ready to get to the other side! Are you?

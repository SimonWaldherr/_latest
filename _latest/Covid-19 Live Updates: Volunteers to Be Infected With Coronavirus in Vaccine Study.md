  Covid-19 Live Updates: Volunteers to Be Infected With Coronavirus in Vaccine Study 
description: > 
  ET Covid-19 Live Updates: Volunteers to Be Infected With Coronavirus in Vaccine Study Researchers in London are planning the world’s first effort to study how people immunized with different vaccines respond to exposure to the virus.Such a study could save time in the race to winnow down a large number of vaccine candidates.It is possible that by early next year, some of the vaccine candidates now undergoing trials will have already received approval.“People are tired of Covid,” Mr. Trump complained on the call, which several reporters were invited into.But scientists have warned that taking a vaccine that has not completed Phase 3 trials carries health risks.

The scientists will test gradually increasing doses of virus on up to 90 healthy volunteers from 18 to 30 years old until they reach a level that reliably infects them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Once they have decided on a dose &#8212; potentially by late spring, the government said &#8212; researchers will begin to compare a set of coronavirus vaccine candidates by immunizing people and then deliberately infecting them. The government will decide which vaccines to test, but it has not announced them yet.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is possible that by early next year, some of the vaccine candidates now undergoing trials will have already received approval.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But experts in medical ethics are divided over whether such a study is acceptable, largely because there is no highly effective treatment for Covid-19. The Imperial College London researchers said they would use the antiviral medicine remdesivir, but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/health/Covid-treatments-remdesivir.html" title="">that drug has been found to have only modest benefit</a>. Most other challenge trials have involved diseases like cholera and typhoid, which can be quickly and reliably cured with drugs.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Another concern is that the illness caused by the coronavirus is unpredictable, and although young people in general do not become gravely ill, there have been unexpected and unexplained cases of severe illness in young patients.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The trial will need approval from Britain&#8217;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before volunteers are enrolled, and it will be monitored by independent experts once it begins, the researchers said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">At least initially, the challenge trial will involve only young, healthy volunteers, meaning the findings may not fully apply to the people at greatest risk of severe illness from Covid-19 &#8212; older people and those with underlying health problems.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The researchers said volunteers would be compensated for their time taking part in the trial and their two to three weeks in quarantine following infection. About 2,000 people in Britain have expressed interest in taking part in challenge trials through an American group, 1Day Sooner, that advocates for such studies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The trial will be run by Imperial College London together with hVivo, a company that specializes in human challenge trials. It will initially be held at a hospital in north London.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-mueller" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-calls-fauci-a-disaster-and-shrugs-off-the-virus-as-infections-soar"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-calls-fauci-a-disaster-and-shrugs-off-the-virus-as-infections-soar">Trump calls Fauci a &#8216;disaster&#8217; and shrugs off the virus as infections soar.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Dr. Anthony S.

Fauci as &#8220;a disaster&#8221; on Monday</a> and said, despite signs that the nation was headed toward another coronavirus peak, that people were &#8220;tired&#8221; of hearing about the virus from &#8220;these idiots&#8221; in the government.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The broadside, during a conference call with campaign staff just two weeks before Election Day, was hardly the closing message Trump advisers were looking for. It threatened to focus the electorate squarely on the president&#8217;s coronavirus response and pitted him against Dr. Fauci, who as the nation&#8217;s top infectious disease expert is a career government scientist the public likes and trusts far more than Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In increasingly vocal terms, Dr. Fauci has been separating himself from the White House and warning Americans to &#8220;hunker down&#8221; and brace for a difficult winter &#8212; a message at odds with Mr. Trump&#8217;s repeated, if false, assurances that the nation is &#8220;rounding the corner&#8221; on a pandemic that has claimed about 220,000 American lives.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;People are tired of Covid,&#8221; Mr. Trump complained on the call, which several reporters were invited into. &#8220;I have the biggest rallies I&#8217;ve ever had. And we have Covid. People are saying: &#8216;Whatever. Just leave us alone.&#8217; They&#8217;re tired of it.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He added, &#8220;People are tired of hearing Fauci and these idiots, all these idiots who got it wrong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Later Monday, at a campaign rally in Prescott, Ariz., Mr. Trump invoked Dr. Fauci as a way of ridiculing the coronavirus plan of his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Biden wants to lock it down. He wants to listen to Dr. Fauci,&#8221; the president said, referring to coronavirus-related restrictions on the economy. (Dr. Fauci, addressing a group of pathologists last week, said no one wants to &#8220;shut down the country again.&#8221;)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Biden campaign, which has been emphasizing a promise to listen to science over politics, responded with relish: &#8220;Mr. President, you&#8217;re right about one thing: The American people are tired. They&#8217;re tired of your lies about this virus.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sheryl-gay-stolberg" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sheryl Gay Stolberg</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Maggie Haberman</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/noah-weiland" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-virus-update-in-three-charts">A virus update, in three charts.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In today&#8217;s edition of the Morning newsletter, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/briefing/presidential-debate-jeffrey-toobin-coronavirus.html" title="">David Leonhardt writes</a>:</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Let&#8217;s check in on the state of the coronavirus this morning, with help from three charts. Here&#8217;s the first:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: The COVID Tracking Project, state and local health agencies and hospitals</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As you can see, the number of new virus cases in the U.S. is surging &#8212; and not far from this summer&#8217;s peak. You&#8217;re probably familiar with versions of that blue line. It is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">the most common metric</a> for tracking the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The rising line mostly reflects reality: The virus is surging, especially in the Upper Midwest. Cooler weather is leading to more indoor activity, which often leads to new cases, and many Americans seem <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/us/coronavirus-pandemic-fatigue.html" title="">tired of pandemic restrictions</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But you&#8217;ll notice that the red line on the chart &#8212; the number of Americans currently hospitalized with virus complications &#8212; looks less bad. It has risen lately, but it is not close to its peak.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Why? Partly because the number of virus cases is not actually rising as much as the official case numbers suggest.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That brings us to chart No. 2:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: The COVID Tracking Project</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The U.S. is conducting <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lot more tests</a> than in the summer or spring. More widespread testing means that the official numbers are capturing a larger share of new virus cases than earlier this year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We have probably gotten better at finding cases, as testing capacity has increased, and so we can&#8217;t directly compare the size of the waves based on case counts alone,&#8221; Caitlin Rivers of Johns Hopkins University told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good development.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The third chart also suggests some encouraging news:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: state and local health agencies and hospitals</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Even as case numbers have soared and hospitalizations have risen, deaths have held fairly steady.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That&#8217;s happened as many older people &#8212; who are most vulnerable &#8212; have been careful about avoiding exposure. A greater share of current new cases is among young Americans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The quality of virus treatments is also improving. Remdesivir, dexamethasone and monoclonal antibodies all seem to help, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/dose-covid-related-optimism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as my colleague Donald G. McNeil Jr. points out</a>. Just consider how quickly both President Trump and Chris Christie recovered, despite their age and underlying health risks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The full picture: </strong>There are some silver linings. The statistics on new virus cases that get so much attention are somewhat exaggerating the severity of the current outbreak, because of the rise in testing. And treatments have improved, reducing the death count.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the virus&#8217;s toll has still been horrific &#8212; and worse than in many other countries. More than 220,000 Americans have died, and hundreds of people are still dying every day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The overall situation is also getting worse, as the hospitalization numbers make clear. In some states, hospitals are almost full, and the virus continues to spread. &#8220;I&#8217;m just waiting to see if our community can change our behavior,&#8221; Debra Konitzer, the top health officer in Oconto County, Wis., <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-wisconsin-health-south-dakota-9039f5a16a2efb826dc4c20fae6bc204" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently said</a>. &#8220;Otherwise, I don&#8217;t see the end in sight.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As Donald McNeil says, &#8220;The fall wave has just begun.&#8221;</p><p class="css-j3uhc5"></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="ireland-to-become-the-first-european-country-to-reimpose-a-national-lockdown"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#ireland-to-become-the-first-european-country-to-reimpose-a-national-lockdown">Ireland to become the first European country to reimpose a national lockdown.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A barber shop in Dublin on Monday.

He noted that, while recent restrictions appeared to have stemmed the spread of the virus, &#8220;evidence of a potential grave situation arriving in the weeks ahead is now too strong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;While we have slowed the spread the virus, this has not been enough and further action is required,&#8221; he said in a national address on Monday night.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Under the new restrictions, nonessential shops will be closed and people will be urged to stay at home, with the exception of exercise that must take place no more than three miles from home. Restaurants will be limited to takeout or delivery.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Meeting in private homes or yards will be banned as will larger gatherings &#8212; though there is an exemption for weddings and funerals with strict limitations on numbers. Schools and child-care services will remain open despite the restrictions, a move that Mr. Martin defended as being in the best interest of children.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He encouraged the nation to remain hopeful, even as new restrictions altered lives and livelihoods once again and the days grow shorter, adding that &#8220;even as the winter comes in, there is hope and there is light.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If we pull together over the last six weeks,&#8221; Mr. Martin told the nation, &#8220;we will have the opportunity to celebrate Christmas in a meaningful way.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-specia" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="deadline-day-for-stimulus-talks-in-the-us-where-things-stand"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#deadline-day-for-stimulus-talks-in-the-us-where-things-stand">Deadline day for stimulus talks in the U.S.: Where things stand.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Capitol on Sunday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/18/us/politics/18election-briefing-pelosi-sub/merlin_178697223_9bc20ff4-bcf4-4649-9190-1dbd31212a70-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Capitol on Sunday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California set a Tuesday deadline for a compromise stimulus deal that could be considered before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She instructed key Democratic lawmakers on Monday to work with top Republicans to try to resolve critical differences holding up a broad agreement with the Trump administration.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The directive came after she and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, held their latest talks, speaking for nearly an hour by phone. The two &#8220;continued to narrow their differences,&#8221; said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi. He added that &#8220;the speaker continues to hope that, by the end of the day Tuesday, we will have clarity on whether we will be able to pass a bill before the election.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The odds of a last-minute deal remain long, with Democrats and the Trump administration still haggling over funding levels and policy issues. Even if they could agree, Senate Republicans have all but ruled out embracing a plan anywhere near as large as the more than $2 trillion package under discussion.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">If such a deal were struck, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the chamber would consider it, but he also made a point of scheduling two separate votes in the coming days on narrower bills of the kind senators in his party are more willing to accept. One would revive a lapsed federal loan program for small businesses and the other would provide $500 billion for schools, testing and expired unemployment benefits.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump has insisted in recent days that he wants to spend more than the $2.4 trillion Ms. Pelosi has put forward in negotiations, and claimed he could easily cajole enough Senate Republicans into supporting an agreement of that size &#8212; a notion that many of them have told his top deputies would never happen.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a private call with Democrats on Monday, Ms. Pelosi outlined a number of remaining areas of disagreement, including Democratic demands for hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for state and local governments, support for restaurants devastated by the pandemic and additional health provisions, according to a person on the call, who disclosed the details on condition of anonymity.

But it gained new urgency this fall, as the difficulties of remote learning deepened disparities in student performance.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Only 7.2 percent of white students in San Diego&#8217;s secondary schools received grades of D or F in the last school year, according to district data, compared with 20 percent of Black students, more than 22 percent of Latino students and more than 23 percent of Native American students.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Forty-six percent of the district&#8217;s students overall are Latino, 12 percent are Asian-Pacific Islander, 8 percent are Black and a small proportion are Native American, he said. Two-thirds of the teachers are white.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We focused on becoming an anti-racist school district,&#8221; Mr. Barrera said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The grading change has drawn criticism from some conservatives, who say it diminishes the idea of academic excellence. But Kevin Beiser, a trustee who teaches middle-school math in a nearby district, said standards-based grading is meant to mitigate inequities like teachers conflating behavior with academic achievement, or affluent students having greater access to tutors.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter when you learn how to solve for x in algebra, as long as you learn it before the end of the school year,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-hubler" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="australia-welcomed-new-zealanders-to-visit-only-two-states-theyre-now-traveling-around-the-country"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#australia-welcomed-new-zealanders-to-visit-only-two-states-theyre-now-traveling-around-the-country">Australia welcomed New Zealanders to visit only two states.

Thursday's competing town halls provided the perfect inspiration for the opening skit on "Saturday Night Live."

The sketch show kicked off by spoofing ABC's town hall with the vibe of a "poorly attended college lecture," hosted by Mikey Day's George Stephanopoulos and featuring the return of Jim Carrey's former vice president Joe Biden, dubbed a "future oatmeal spokesman" by Day.

But, as in real life, the excitement began when "SNL" flipped over to Kate McKinnon as "surprise bada--" Savannah Guthrie, or "Serengeti" as Alec Baldwin's President Donald Trump called her.

"If you were angry at NBC for doing this town hall, just let me get a few questions in, and I think you'll thank me," said McKinnon's Guthrie.

"I'd like to start by tearing you a new one," she said before asking about white supremacy and criticizing his Twitter habits: "You're not just someone's crazy uncle."

It became too much for Maya Rudolph's Kamala Harris when a zealous Black Trump supporter, shown over his shoulder, kept nodding enthusiastically and, at one point, got out of her seat and began dancing.

"Somebody has to ask: What the hell is happening with that woman back there? Because I only nod that much when a waiter asks if I'll be having mimosas at brunch," Rudolph's Harris said. She felt it was some "Jordan Peele nonsense."

Meanwhile, Carrey's Biden soothed a small audience while putting on a cardigan and singing, "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" Later, Carrey's Biden adopted a Bob Ross persona, paintbrush and all.

Over on NBC, it was "WrestleMania," where McKinnon's Guthrie hit Baldwin's Trump with a folding chair.

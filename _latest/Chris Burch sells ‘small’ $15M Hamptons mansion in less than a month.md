Burch society: The billionaire CEO found a buyer for his spectacular Southampton home.

Entrepreneur Chris Burch, co-founder of ex-wife Tory Burch’s eponymously named clothing and accessories empire, has sold his Hamptons home for $15.5 million.

Burch, founder and CEO of Burch Creative Capital, bought the mansion in Southampton for $8.55 million in 2009, according to property records.

Burch netted about about 3.4 percent over the $14.99 million asking price for 232 First Neck Lane, which listed on Sept. 11. (Page Six initially reported that Burch had sold the spread for $18 million.)

Sotheby’s Harald Grant had the listing, while Sotheby’s Jonathan Smith repped the buyer. Burch’s renovations to the ranch-style property, by architectural designer Marina Lanina and interior designer Christopher Maya, were featured in Architectural Digest in 2013.

The 7,000-square-foot property — the site of multiple parties over the years — features nine bedrooms, nine bathrooms and two half baths.

Burch, a 67-year-old father of six, told AD’s Raul Barreneche: “I didn’t want anything too grand … I wanted it to feel more like a cottage than an estate.”

There’s a pool, a pool house and tennis courts on the gorgeously landscaped property.

The home itself features lacquered walls, heavy doors, vaulted ceilings, exposed beams, a fireplace and a chef’s kitchen that leads to a patio with an outdoor kitchen.

“The house is a little electric in spots, but I’m not scared of color,” Burch told AD in 2013. “It’s cool. It’s small. It’s very happy.”

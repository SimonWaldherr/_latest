  Coronavirus vaccine storage hurdles may leave 3 billion people without it 
description: > 
  From factory to syringe, the world’s most promising coronavirus vaccine candidates need nonstop sterile refrigeration to work.But despite great strides in equipping developing countries to maintain the vaccine “cold chain,” nearly 3 billion of the world's 7.8 billion people live in places with insufficient temperature-controlled storage for an immunization campaign to bring COVID-19 under control.The mother of two thinks it will be difficult for her family to get coronavirus vaccines.To uphold the cold chain in developing nations, international organizations have overseen the installation of tens of thousands of solar-powered vaccine refrigerators.Coronavirus vaccines will be one of the world’s most sought-after products, so theft is also a danger.

Logistics experts say most of Africa and much of Southeast Asia, Central Asia and Latin America lack the infrastructure to preserve even more conventional vaccines.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>A tiny medical clinic outside Burkina Faso's capital that went nearly a year without a working refrigerator is a microcosm of how the cold chain can break.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-governor-cuomo-lays-out-massive-covid-19-vaccination-plan" target="_blank">NY GOV CUOMO LAYS OUT MASSIVE COVID-19 VACCINATION PLAN</a></strong></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>The clinic in Gampela couldn't keep vaccines on site once its refrigerator broke last fall, nurse Julienne Zoungrana said.

Cargo ships are too slow for vaccines with a limited shelf life. Carrying vaccines by air at cold temperatures costs a lot more, and air cargo traffic is only now rebounding from pandemic-related border closures.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>German logistics company DHL, which has expanded its cold storage capacity in response to the pandemic, estimated that 15,000 cargo flights would be required to fully vaccinate the world against the coronavirus.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/healthy-young-people-coronavirus-vaccine-until-2022-who-official" target="_blank"><strong>HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE MAY WAIT FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE UNTIL 2022, WHO OFFICIAL SAYS</strong></a></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>For every gap in the cold chain &#8220;we need to find a bridge,&#8221; DHL chief commercial officer Katja Busch said.</p><p>Coronavirus vaccines will be one of the world&#8217;s most sought-after products, so theft is also a danger.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t be left on a tarmac and fought over because they would actually be spoiled and they would have no value &#8212;&#8239;or worse still, people would still be trying to distribute them,&#8221; said Glyn Hughes, the global head of cargo for the International Air Transport Association.</p><p>Johns Hopkins University researcher Tinglong Dai, who specializes in health care logistics, said creativity will be needed to keep the cold chain intact while coronavirus vaccines are dispersed on a global scale.

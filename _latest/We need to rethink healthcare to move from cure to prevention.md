<div><p>We need a system built around wellness and not sickness. The Covid pandemic showed us that we cannot rely on waiting for people to get sick and then deal with their emergencies.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to spend our efforts on preventing those crises and emergencies from happening. We learnt to put emphasis on what mattered most and combined human expertise with the accessibility of everyday technologies and data to help people proactively manage their health and prevent the crisis.</p>
<p>It sounds grand, and maybe even far-fetched, but this pandemic has shown us what we can do.</p>
<p>Our NHS partners needed to ensure their time-pressed staff were looking after the most needy patients.</p>
<p>So we built a Covid-19 Care Assistant that can give information and reassurance to the large number of patients who need it, and find the much smaller group of patients who need to speak to a doctor 24/7, have their recovery monitored, and be provided with a care plan.</p>
<p>It can help with huge groups of people and, most importantly, allows the same number of frontline staff to help a much greater number of people, all whilst making sure that people get the care they need.</p>

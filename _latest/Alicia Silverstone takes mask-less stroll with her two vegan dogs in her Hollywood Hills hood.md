  Alicia Silverstone takes mask-less stroll with her two vegan dogs in her Hollywood Hills hood 
description: > 
  On Tuesday, the Kind Life founder Alicia Silverstone walked her two nine-year-old rescue dogs Dixon and Tiny - who, like her, have a strict vegan diet - near the $597K four-bedroom Hollywood Hills home she bought back in 1996.'Why are we afraid that we may die from SARsCoV2 virus, but not from the death that may comes from poor food choices?The number of deaths from cancers and cardiovascular disease are staggering,' Silverstone wrote.To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie Clueless, costume designer Mona May spoke with Tatler about how she keeps in touch with Alicia.I've seen it in animatic form, but I've also seen where we are headed, and it is beautiful.'

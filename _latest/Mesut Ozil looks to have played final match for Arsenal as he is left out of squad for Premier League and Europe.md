<div><p>Mesut Ozil appears to have played his last game for Arsenal after he was left out of the club&#8217;s Premier League squad for this season.</p>
<p>Ozil&#8217;s contract expires at the end of the campaign and he will not be able to represent Arsenal in either the Premier League or the Europa League <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/07/mesut-ozil-left-arsenals-europa-league-squad-exile-continues/">after being omitted from both squad lists</a>.</p>
<p>Arsenal were unable to sell some of their unwanted players in the summer window, meaning that they now have too many bodies in their squad. Sokratis, their Greek centre-back, has also been left off the Premier League and Europa League squad lists.</p>
<p>Ozil is the club&#8217;s highest earner on &#163;350,000 a week but he has not played a competitive match under Mikel Arteta since early March.</p>
<p>The 32 year-old had interest from abroad during the summer window, with clubs in Saudi Arabia and Qatar both keen on signing him, but he has been insistent for months that he has no intention of leaving London and uprooting his family.</p>
<p>Per Mertesacker, Ozil&#8217;s former team-mate and the current academy manager at Arsenal, has suggested that the playmaker&#8217;s &#8220;focus&#8221; has changed in recent months.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot has changed away from the pitch,&#8221; Mertesacker told the Klick and Rush podcast. &#8220;He got married, has a family... perhaps his focus has changed. Nevertheless, he is still happy and happy to play football.</p>
<p>&#8220;He's the only player I've played with for three teams - Bremen, Arsenal and also Germany. So, I'm very sorry that he's currently in a situation where he's not really used.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ozil propelled himself into the headlines again earlier this month, when he offered to pay the full salary of the Arsenal employee who doubles up as club mascot Gunnersaurus. Ozil said he would <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/06/mesut-ozil-rides-gunnersaurus-rescue-offer-pay-jerry-quys-wages/">reimburse Arsenal with Jerry Quy&#8217;s full salary</a> for &#8220;as long as I will be an Arsenal player&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sokratis, also 32, was free to leave the club in the transfer window but a deal could not be struck. He is understood to earn close to &#163;100,000 per week and has one year remaining on&#160;the deal he signed in July 2018, when he joined from Borussia Dortmund for around &#163;18 million.</p>
<p>As with Ozil, Sokratis fell out of contention at Arsenal following the lockdown in spring. He started against West Ham United in March, their last game before football&#8217;s suspension, but played only three minutes of competitive action following the restart.</p>

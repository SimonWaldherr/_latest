  But her attempts to deflect such questions were more conspicuous than usual, given how explicit Mr. Trump has been about how he would want his Supreme Court nominees to rule.The president has stated that he wants Judge Barrett confirmed by Election Day given that he anticipates an election dispute and is “counting” on the court to “look at the ballots.” And he has said he wants justices who would “do the right thing” and invalidate the Affordable Care Act.“This is what President Trump said.This is what your party platform says: Reverse the Obamacare cases,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, addressing Republican senators.“Why is it surprising for us to be concerned that you want this nominee to do what you want nominees to do?”Republicans, rushing to secure Judge Barrett’s confirmation before the election, lavished her with praise for her legal qualifications and personal virtues.

“I am left with looking at the tracks of your record and where it leads the American people,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, “and I think it leads us to a place that’s going to have severe repercussions for them.”

Judge Barrett’s refusal to discuss specific cases or commit to recusing from particular matters was in line with a decades-old playbook used by Supreme Court nominees to avoid giving substantive answers during confirmation hearings. But her attempts to deflect such questions were more conspicuous than usual, given how explicit Mr. Trump has been about how he would want his Supreme Court nominees to rule.

The president has stated that he wants Judge Barrett confirmed by Election Day given that he anticipates an election dispute and is “counting” on the court to “look at the ballots.” And he has said he wants justices who would “do the right thing” and invalidate the Affordable Care Act.

“This is what President Trump said. This is what your party platform says: Reverse the Obamacare cases,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, addressing Republican senators. “Why is it surprising for us to be concerned that you want this nominee to do what you want nominees to do?”

Republicans, rushing to secure Judge Barrett’s confirmation before the election, lavished her with praise for her legal qualifications and personal virtues. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the judiciary panel’s chairman, called her “one of the most qualified people of your generation,” while Senator John Cornyn of Texas encouraged her to hold up the blank notepad in front of her at the witness table to show that she was speaking entirely without notes.

<div><p>President Donald Trump is on a time zone-defying campaign tour as the clock winds down to Election Day, making campaign appearances in recent days in Florida, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona, heading to Pennsylvania on Tuesday, and North Carolina and Tennessee on Wednesday ahead of Thursday's Nashville debate against Democratic nominee Joe Biden.</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>Biden, meanwhile, hasn't been racking up the frequent flier miles so much: He was in Michigan last Friday, North Carolina on Sunday, was set to tape a "60 Minutes" interview Monday and had no announced campaign travel before Thursday night's debate.</p><p>That might seem to be a risky strategy, even for a challenger running comfortably ahead in polls &#8211; though not as comfortably as public surveys indicate, Biden's campaign manager warns. But Biden has something Trump does not &#8211; a team of high-profile campaign surrogates who campaign on Biden's behalf and perhaps light a fire under voters the candidate himself does not excite.</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on the 2020 Election</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/e122dd2/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fdb%2F15%2F841be3fb4587a8ad9b19842d1e3c%2F20201016edptc-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>Former President Barack Obama will be making his first public campaign appearance for his former vice president on Wednesday, when Obama will appeal to voters in Philadelphia. Jill Biden, the president's spouse, has kept a very active travel schedule, as has Doug Emhoff, who is married to vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris.</p><p>Meanwhile, a slew of Biden's former primary foes &#8211; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as businessman Andrew Yang and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro &#8211; have gotten on planes to campaign for Biden. Basketball great Magic Johnson was in Michigan for Biden over the weekend.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has made it more complicated for candidates to travel, says Eric Kasper, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, noting that Trump's infection kept him off the trail for a while. "How do you pick up the slack? The use of surrogates can certainly help fill that void, giving the candidate more time for debate prep."</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>For the 77-year-old Biden, contracting the coronavirus would not only disrupt his personal health but shake up a race he appears to be dominating. Any questions about his health &#8211; or any story that shifts the focus from incumbent Trump to Biden &#8211; could derail his campaign narrative, analysts say.</p><p>When Biden has traveled recently, he has avoided media questions that would shift the daily story from his campaign message. As he campaigned in North Carolina on Sunday, Biden would only remark that he had not gotten the "black and white" milkshake he had ordered at a Cookout he visited with his granddaughter, saying he would have to mix a vanilla and a chocolate shake in the car en route to the airport. He wouldn't answer questions about election interference and other topics.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Campaign surrogates are useful for Biden because while they can appeal to certain constituencies Biden needs &#8211; such as progressive voters who might listen more closely to Sanders or Warren &#8211; they will not endure the same daily media scrutiny as Biden.</p><p>Presidents and presidential candidates have a human starting pistol quality on the campaign, where almost anything they say can turn into a headline. That is why, Biden has said bluntly he did not want to discuss whether he approved of expanding the size of the Supreme Court, because it would become the day's headlines. Surrogates tend to be left alone to discuss the candidates and issues.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>A strong social media presence by surrogates is especially useful this year with travel being a health hazard, he says. Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama offer that advantage, blunting Trump's tremendous social media reach.</p><p>Trump has surrogates, too &#8211; but they are mainly people also named Trump. While first lady Melania Trump has not stumped for her husband, presidential offspring Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric have made campaign appearances, as has Lara Trump, Eric Trump's spouse.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence travels for the ticket, but Trump does not have prominent GOP senators or former primary foes on the trail advocating for his reelection. That's partly because some prominent Republicans are separating from Trump, but also because the president doesn't think anyone else can male the same connection, experts say.</p><p>"Trump believes that he is his own best messenger, and he really doesn't believe that others deliver the message in the way he does, or engages and excites his supporters the way he does," says Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University.</p><p>"There is a kind of symbiotic relationship" surrogates can't duplicate, Brown says. "There is this call-and-response. I don't think anyone else could do that for Trump."<br></p></div>

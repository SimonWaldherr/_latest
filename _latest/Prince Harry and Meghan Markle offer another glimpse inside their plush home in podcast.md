Prince Harry and Meghan Markle offered another glimpse inside their plush California home as they made their podcast debut for World Mental Health Day.

Wearing face masks, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex looked relaxed as they sat beside a fireplace opposite the hosts of the podcasts which was filmed at their $14million 16-bathroom mansion in upscale Santa Barbara.

Prince Harry, 36, wearing a casual grey polo shirt and jeans, and Meghan, 39, wearing a stripy top and cropped-jeans, sat together on a white sofa.

The backdrop was a large stone fireplace with a wooden shelf holding an ornamental bowl.

For the duration of the 30-minute podcast, the couple huddled together on a white two-seater circular sofa festooned with large cushions.

The royals have bravely opted for crisp white furnishings despite having two dogs with muddy paws and a young toddler.

The podcast, entitled Teenager Therapy, describes itself online as 'five stressed, sleep deprived, yet energetic teens sit down and talk about the struggles that come with being a teenager'.

They discussed the stigma surrounding the topic and 'how we can all contribute to a healthier world: physically, mentally, emotionally and holistically' with high school students from their Santa Barbara villa.

The eye-watering costs of running their home The Sussexes took out a multi-million-pound mortgage to buy their spectacular home. Sources say the couple are 'proud' to have bought the home without help from family. Deeds show they took out a £7.25million mortgage to be paid back, plus interest, by 2050 – indicating they put down a deposit of around £3.8million. Mortgage repayments will cost them some £30,000 a month and they will also have a yearly property tax of £220,000. This is on top of the cost of maintenance, cleaning, staff and security and utilities which could run into tens of thousands of pounds a month. The couple are also paying back the £2.4million spent on renovating Frogmore Cottage in £18,000-a-month instalments. It is not clear how the duke and duchess will pay for all of this. When they quit royal duties they made a point of stressing that they wanted to become financially independent Advertisement

1. Circular two-seater

For the duration of the 30-minute podcast, Harry and Meghan huddled together on a white two-seater circular sofa festooned with large cushions.

Harry perched toward the front with his elbow resting on the arm of the sofa. Meghan took a more relaxed approach as she sat with one leg tucked underneath her.

2. Faux fur throw

The couple's lavish home shows a love for white furnishings and luxury accents.

The addition of a fluffy faux fur throw draped over the two-seater showed an attention to detail likely added to bring a touch of homeliness.

3. Decorative bowl

The Duke and Duchess had artfully arranged a statement bowl above the mantelpiece to draw the eye in the absence of other artworks.

The stone piece dominated the room with decorative bowls seeming to be a favourite of Meghan's who used a similar styling trick while working as an actress in Suits and living at her Toronto home.

4. Luxury stone fireplace

The podcast was set against a backdrop of a luxury stone fireplace which boasted an open fire.

Although temporarily obscured behind a fireguard, the hearth appeared to have been recently used with ash lining the stone flagging.

5. Light shades

The wall-mounted lights in the room were topped with hexagonal cream lampshades which were traditionally pleated.

6. Cushions

A set of three stone-coloured cushions sat behind the Duke and Duchess on what a rustic window seat tucked into the alcove next to the fireplace.

7. Three-seater sofa

Despite having two dogs with muddy paws and a young toddler, the royals have bravely opted for a white couch in their living space.

It appears to offer a place in the room to relax and recline when not working, or perhaps a space to take meetings similar to that experienced for the podcast.

8. Rattan-style floor covering

The floor was hidden beneath a rattan-style floor covering which spanned the length of the room.

The traditional piece appeared to be loosely frayed at the edges and had rippled in some areas beneath the weight of the equipment stands.

Natural rattan furniture, which has become increasingly popular in recent years, often comes with a hefty price tag due to its strength and durability.

9. Ornate table

Tucked away behind the podcast hosts was an ornately inlaid wooden table which looked to be an antique.

It held another, smaller, decorative bowl - an apparent favourite accessory of the Duke and Duchess.

10. Room with a view

The interview room was drenched in natural light that streamed in from the two windows, located either side of the fireplace, which did not appear to be hidden behind curtains or blinds.

The scene beyond revealed a garden adorned with tropical palm trees in a sea of greens.

Meghan Markle's Toronto-inspired interiors The style is very similar to the interior of Meghan's Toronto home, where she lived before joining the royal family. The then-actress regularly shared snaps on Instagram of her home's white colour palette and mid-century modern furnishings. Despite having two dogs with muddy paws, the then-actress bravely opted for a white couch in her living space with a grey striped throw from the luxury textiles brand Pamuk and Co. Her dining table was white marble and she placed a full length shabby chic vintage mirror resting on the wall behind it to create the illusion of extra space. While the star has long favoured mid-century modern furniture and a white colour palette, she added vibrant pops of colour with accessories such as a red striped rug in the hallway. She has also always been a fan of fresh flowers, especially pink peonies which she has declared are her favourite. But rather than being a gift from Harry, she reveals that she regularly treats herself to her favourite bouquets. 'I bought these peonies for myself yesterday because they make me so endlessly happy. Do something sweet for yourself today too,' she advised her followers. She's a fan of a scented candle, including Diptyque's Figuier with fresh wood, green notes and crushed fig leaves and the Le Labo Santal 26 Classic Candle, £51, with 'gentle, smokey and leathery tones'. Meghan is also appreciates fine art, and had a print of one of fine art photographer Gray Malin's birds' eye view beach vistas on the the wall of her living area. Above the bed in the guest room hung a figure study watercolour by New York based artist and illustrator Inslee Fariss, estimated to have cost $650 (£520). In her own room, Meghan's bed frame was an oversized wrought iron birdcage design and she continued her white theme with the curtains and bedding. Meghan artfully arranged her books around the house, turning them into design features by perching them underneath jugs of flowers. She was a fan of coffee table fashion books, such as former Vogue Paris editor Carine Roitfeld's style bible and Linda McCartney's photographic memoir.

The glimpse into the couple's home came earlier this evening following the release of the Teenager Therapy podcast as the couple talked to hosts Gael, Kayla and Thomas about their own experience of mental health.

Meghan said that the impact of the pandemic had pushed people increasingly toward the internet which she claimed opened up a 'vulnerability' and a place for 'disconnection'.

She said: 'I can speak personally because I'm told that in 2019 I was the most trolled person in the entire world - male or female.

'Now eight months of that I wasn't even visible. I was on maternity leave or with a baby. But what was able to just be manufactured and churned out. It's almost unsurvivable.'

She added: 'That's so big you can't even think about what that feels like because I don't care if you're 15 or 25 if people are saying things about you that aren't true what that does to your mental and emotional health is so damaging.

'And so I think from my standpoint, and part of the work that we do from our own personal experience, being able to talk to people and understand that even though our experience is unique to us - and obviously can seem very different to what people experience on the day-to-day - its still a human experience and that's universal.

'We all know what it feels like to have our feelings hurt, we all know what it feels like to be isolated or 'othered'... we are all figuring it out.'

The Sussexes learned about the podcast - which usually features five students from Loara High School in Anaheim, Orange County - after reading a New York Times profile of the teenagers in July.

After listening to a few episodes of the series, they decided they wanted to support the teens' work. They recorded the episode this week in their new hometown of Montecito, with all the participants wearing masks during the recording.

The Duke has long been open up about his struggles with mental health, and revealed he needed counselling after the death of his mother, Princess Diana.

It was announced last year that Prince Harry was partnering with Oprah Winfrey as co-creators and executive producers of a forthcoming mental health documentary series for Apple.

The multi-part documentary series will focus on both mental illness and mental wellness, and aims to inspire viewers to have an honest conversation about the challenges they face.

Their new podcast appearance comes weeks after reports suggested the Duke and Duchess were set to be offered a seven figure deal to produce podcasts for Spotify.

The streaming giant, which is worth £22billion, are hoping to sign the royal couple following the success of The Michelle Obama podcast which has been a huge ratings hit.

Sources told the Mirror that money is 'no object' for Spotify and Meghan would be able to 'more or less name her price'.

An insider said: 'The Duke and Duchess have been on their hit list for a while and a detailed proposal is set to be presented to Meghan's US agent in a matter of weeks.'

Rumours of Harry and Meghan seeking to gain a foothold in Hollywood have run rampant ever since the couple announced their plans to quit as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America in January.

The couple, who are breaking away from the monarchy to earn their own money in the US, have had to ditch using Sussex Royal as their brand name.

Meghan and Prince Harry's new home sits on 5.4 acres of land and immaculately clipped hedges border the estate's stone-pillared entry gates.

Property listings say the home took nearly five years to build and included a library, office, spa with a separate dry and wet sauna, a gym with a stripper pole, game room, arcade, theater, wine cellar and five-car garage.

The entrance to the property opens onto a wide lane paved with hand-cut Santa Barbara Stone that leads through a grand archway of trees to the main residence, according to Zillow.

The estate has sweeping lawns, tiered rose gardens, tall Italian cypress trees, blooming lavender, century old olive trees, a tennis court, tea house, children's cottage and a pool.

It also boasts a two-bedroom, two-bath guest house, perfect for Meghan's mother Doria, who is acting as one-year-old Archie's nanny. Doria has already been to the house, TMZ reports.

The home's seller is thought to be Russian tycoon Sergey Grishin who bought the 'palatial' mansion for more than $25million in 2009 and had tried to sell the home for up to $34million before eventually accepting a loss.

Grishin is also the former owner of a different California estate - known as the Scarface mansion because it appeared in the 1983 Al Pacino movie - which sold for a similarly cut-price $12million in 2015.

Surrounded by lush green gardens and overlooking the sea, the home has been described as a 'hidden paradise'.

One estate agent who spent an hour inside said it was 'designed for someone who never wants to leave home'.

Brett Buschbom said: 'I went through this house and an hour later I'm coming out like 'wow', the whole bottom floor felt like a resort with steam room, massage room, sauna, Jacuzzi, full bar, arcade and one of the most amazing wine cellars and that was just the basement.'

While it is unknown if the couple have plans to transform their new home, the Duke and Duchess previously worked with interior designers to achieve the perfect look.

Last year, Meghan was understood to have enlisted Vicky Charles, former Global Head of Design at Soho House and a favourite of A-list celebrities, to work her magic on Frogmore House.

Speaking previously, Ms Charles has noted her Soho House interiors brought together the 'grit and the glamour'.

The overall feeling is one that is eclectic yet pulled-together, rooms that feel cohesive but are not overly rigid or matchy.

'I was the most trolled person in the entire world in 2019', says Meghan Markle as she and Prince Harry speak to US teenagers for World Mental Health Day podcast from their Santa Barbara villa

Meghan Markle has said that she 'was the most trolled person in the entire world in 2019' as she and Prince Harry made their podcast debut for World Mental Health Day.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex discussed the stigma surrounding the topic and 'how we can all contribute to a healthier world: physically, mentally, emotionally and holistically' with high school students from their Santa Barbara villa.

The podcast, entitled Teenager Therapy, describes itself online as 'five stressed, sleep deprived, yet energetic teens sit down and talk about the struggles that come with being a teenager'.

The most recent episode starring Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, went live this evening and saw the couple talk to hosts Gael, Kayla and Thomas about their own experience of mental health.

Meghan said that the impact of the pandemic had pushed people increasingly toward the internet which she claimed opened up a 'vulnerability' and a place for 'disconnection'.

She said: 'I can speak personally because I'm told that in 2019 I was the most trolled person in the entire world - male or female.

'Now eight months of that I wasn't even visible. I was on maternity leave or with a baby. But what was able to just be manufactured and churned out. It's almost unsurvivable.'

Meghan Markle said that she 'was the most trolled person in the entire world in 2019' and it was 'almost un-survivable' as she and Prince Harry made their podcast debut for World Mental Health Day

She added: 'That's so big you can't even think about what that feels like because I don't care if you're 15 or 25 if people are saying things about you that aren't true what that does to your mental and emotional health is so damaging.

'And so I think from my standpoint, and part of the work that we do from our own personal experience, being able to talk to people and understand that even though our experience is unique to us - and obviously can seem very different to what people experience on the day-to-day - its still a human experience and that's universal.

'We all know what it feels like to have our feelings hurt, we all know what it feels like to be isolated or 'othered'... we are all figuring it out.'

Meghan later added that she is now 'doing really well', and said: 'The past few months have been layered for everyone, we certainly can't complain, we are fortunate we all have our health, we have rooves over our heads.'

Harry added: 'The unique part of our work is whatever you're going through and whatever other people are going through, it's all relative to that environment that they're in.

'For the majority of people I've spoken to in London, or in the UK, have been stuck in high-rise blocks of flats, unable to see any open grass or open green space.

'We've felt incredibly grateful and fortunate to be able to have outdoor space where our son can walk his first steps. Outdoor space where he can just have enough space to run and move around. It's a huge blessing.

'It reminds me of how many people are stacked on top of each other and have been for month after month after month after month, and what that must do to people's mental health.'

The Duke of Sussex said: 'I think putting your self-care as a priority is hugely important, because vulnerability is not a weakness, showing vulnerability in today's world especially, is a strength.

'We could certainly see that more from some of those global leaders, because we got ourselves into this very deep hole which we need to come out of.'

Harry praised the teenage hosts and the younger generation for their openness surrounding mental health and personal difficulties, later telling the podcast that he meditates.

He continued: 'The more we talk about it the more it becomes normal, and it is normal, and it's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength.'

He added: 'Our situation is somewhat unique but then every single person's situation is unique, it's a different version of the same thing.

'For Meghan, she said on a global scale, that's what happened in 2019, but if you're a young girl or young boy at school, that's your world, so if you're being attacked, or being bullied or whatever is online... it feels the same.'

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex recorded the special podcast with Teenager Therapy earlier this week, with the episode going live today to mark World Mental Health Day (pictured, the teenage hosts of the podcast)

Harry said: 'I think it's very easy to be sucked in and consumed by negativity, but we all have the choice to be able to cut that out of our lives.

'Hate following has become a thing, you don't need to do that. Just as much as we worry about, be concerned, and take notice of what we put in our bellies as a diet, the same applies for our eyes and our mind, what we're consuming is affecting us.

'For me, I made the choice not to read it, not to see it, and to remove myself from that, and to very much focus on the uplifting and the hopeful side.'

He added: 'What I've seen so much over the years is people hiding behind usernames on the online space. There are things that are said digitally that nobody would say in person, of course.

'But I think there's a lot of projection that happens as well, I think many. many people are hurting, a lot, and are freaking out because of the way the world is and because of, sometimes, the echo chamber that has been created for them by the online platform that they've chosen to be on.

'But also it comes down to control as well, you can control what you see, you can control what you do, so whether it's notifications or whether it's vibration ringtones, whatever it is, these things control you, rather than taking control.'

Meghan later discussed an interview with ITV's Tom Bradby as part of her tour of Africa that she filmed last year, which gained significant attention.

'We were on a tour in South Africa and on the last day of the tour, man I was tired. I was just about to give Archie a bath and I was exhausted.'

Harry said she was breastfeeding at the time, to which Meghan added: 'A lot of people don't know, it's like running a marathon, so between every official engagement I was running back to make sure our son was fed, and it was a lot.

'At the very end the journalist asked me 'well, are you OK?' and I didn't realise that my answer would receive such an interest from around the world, because I said 'well thanks, people haven't really asked me if I'm OK'.

'I didn't think about that answer, I just answered honestly, because I was in a moment of vulnerability because I was tired, because there was no presentation, it was just 'here's where I am, I'm a mum who is with a four-and-half-month-old baby and we are tired'.

'But I think it speaks to the fact that the reason it resonated with people is because everyone wants to be asked if they're OK.'

Prince Harry, 36, and Meghan Markle, 39, already have some experience in podcasts and radio appearances. Pictured during a recent video shared to encourage young people to vote in the upcoming US elections

When asked about their recent activism, Harry said: 'I think the way everything's happening in the world right now, the moment that people start to think about mental health, immediately people think about a small group of people as opposed to every single one of us.

'I think if you could safely say that 90 per cent of people on planet Earth have suffered some form of trauma, some form of loss, some form of grief, and that's different, it varies to every single person, then certainly for this year, through Covid, I think it's probably safe to say that 99.9 per cent, if not 100 per cent of people, have experienced some form of one of those, all those, at the same time.

'Rather than mental health being focused on, the people that are struggling, it needs to go much wider than that, and to the acceptance and the appreciation that every single one of us have mental health, and every single one of us have got stuff going on that we either need to talk about or that we need help with, or that we have some form of compassion and empathy for other people that are going through something similar.'

The Sussexes learned about the podcast - which usually features five students from Loara High School in Anaheim, Orange County - after reading a New York Times profile of the teenagers in July.

After listening to a few episodes of the series, they decided they wanted to support the teens' work. They recorded the episode this week in their new hometown of Montecito, with all the participants wearing masks during the recording.

According to Hello! magazine, Prince Harry and Meghan led the group in deep breathing exercises ahead of the podcast in order to help sooth nerves.

Meanwhile when one of the young hosts, Gael, asked the couple what they would like to be called, the Duke told him 'anything is fine', to which Gael decided to call him 'Big H'.

The Duke has long been open up about his struggles with mental health, and revealed he needed counselling after the death of his mother, Princess Diana.

Their podcast debut comes weeks after rumours emerged that Prince Harry and Meghan were set to sign their own seven figure deal to produce podcasts for Spotify (pictured, while visiting Reprezent 107.3FM in Brixton in January 2018)

... and a very different royal message. 'Come on, Margaret.' Queen's first broadcast is 80 years old By Emily Andrews, Royal Editor for the Mail On Sunday If the two young sisters appear a little nervous, it's because it was their first public address. And this week marks the 80th anniversary of that broadcast, when the Queen – then 14-year-old Princess Elizabeth – and Margaret, then aged ten, addressed the children of the Commonwealth to boost their morale in the dark days of the Second World War. The pair had been evacuated to Windsor Castle, while their parents George VI and Elizabeth stayed in London. Prime Minister Winston Churchill asked the King whether his elder daughter could do her bit for the war effort by making her debut speech on BBC Children's Hour, broadcast on October 13, 1940. She had two weeks of training before addressing those evacuated from home, telling them: 'Thousands of you in this country have had to leave your homes and be separated from your fathers and mothers. 'My sister Margaret Rose and I feel so much for you as we know from experience what it means to be away from those we love most of all.' She talked of evacuees as far away as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the US and finished by saying: 'My sister is by my side and we are both going to say goodnight to you. Come on, Margaret.' Her little sister then joined in. The future Monarch's slightly imperious command became a catchphrase in the US. The speech was so popular that it was released as a gramophone record. In April this year, the Queen referred to the speech in her 'Coronavirus' address: 'We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes... 'Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones.' Advertisement

It was announced last year that Prince Harry was partnering with Oprah Winfrey as co-creators and executive producers of a forthcoming mental health documentary series for Apple.

The multi-part documentary series will focus on both mental illness and mental wellness, and aims to inspire viewers to have an honest conversation about the challenges they face.

Harry has previously opened up about his own battle with depression, revealing that he was 'very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions'.

Speaking in 2018, he said: 'I started to have conversations and actually all of a sudden this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lo of stuff here that I need to deal with.

'For me personally, my brother, you know, bless him, was a huge support to me. He kept saying 'This is not right, this is not normal, you need to talk to someone'.'

Their new podcast appearance comes weeks after reports suggested the Duke and Duchess were set to be offered a seven figure deal to produce podcasts for Spotify.

The couple, who are breaking away from the monarchy to earn their own money in the US, have had to ditch using Sussex Royal as their brand name.

The Sussexes already have some experience in podcasts and radio appearances.

The couple's second ever engagement as a couple was a visit to Reprezent 107.3 FM in Brixton, a 24-hour underground music station.

Meanwhile in 2017, Prince Harry guest edited BBC Radio 4's Today show, while has a starring role in a new Netflix documentary Rising Phoenix, which was released on Wednesday.

Today it was reported that Harry could face a scolding by the Queen amid concerns over his public comments about US politics as royal staff prepare for him to return to the UK - without mention of Meghan, according to reports

Earlier this week Harry and Meghan were spotted enjoying a rare evening out with close friends David Foster, a music producer, and actress Katharine McPhee, who recently announced they are expecting a baby.

On Sunday, the couple will join 23-year-old activist Malala Yousafzai for a video chat to celebrate this year's International Day of the Girl.

They are expected to discuss the barriers currently facing more than 130 million girls around the world who are not currently receiving an education, and what is being done to help them.

Today it was reported Harry could face a scolding by the Queen amid concerns over his public comments about US politics as royal staff prepare for him to return to the UK, according to reports.

It is thought that Palace staff have been told to ready Frogmore Cottage for the imminent return of the duke - without mention of Meghan Markle.

The Queen, 94, is likely to meet with Harry at her 'HMS Bubble' at Windsor after she returned in order to resume audiences and small engagements.

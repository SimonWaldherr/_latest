Honours list: Glaxosmithkline boss Emma Walmsley

The boss of drugs giant Glaxosmithkline has been named in the Queen's Birthday Honours list as the company works on a coronavirus vaccine.

Emma Walmsley - a 51-year-old mother of four - is made a dame for services to the pharmaceutical industry and business, after heading the company for three years.

She said: 'I'm humbled to receive this honour, it is a real testament to the many outstanding people we have.'

Fellow FTSE 100 boss Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent, receives a CBE, as does Richard Flint, who recently retired as Yorkshire Water chief, and Chris Jones, formerly of Welsh Water.

Billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa are also made CBEs a week after they snapped up Asda in a £6.8billion deal.

Property tycoon Tony Gallagher is knighted, and fashion entrepreneur Paul Smith becomes a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

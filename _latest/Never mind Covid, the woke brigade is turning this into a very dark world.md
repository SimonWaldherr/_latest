<div><p>&#8220;Let me make clear, sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right, then. More fool me.</p>
<p>These may be small things, but they sow insecurity and confusion. Where things get properly, concretely sinister is when the actual police start throwing their weight around in opposition to the offensive.</p>
<p>Still-sane people watched with horror last week as conservative commentator Darren Grimes was<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/09/darren-grimes-police-investigation-david-starkey-interview/"> investigated by the police</a> for having posted a video on his YouTube channel of an interview with the historian David Starkey. Starkey &#8211; also under investigation &#8211; had made some disgraceful comments about slavery not having been genocide, &#8220;otherwise there wouldn&#8217;t be so many damn blacks&#8221;.</p>
<p>This was vile and reprehensible, but not incitement to violence or hate, and therefore not a police matter. Even clearer was that Grimes should never have been pursued. We have reached a very perilous path when the police start going after journalists for posting interviews.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has taken much away from us: freedom, pleasure, security and health. The last thing we need right now is the woke brigade making the world even harder, darker, scarier and more alienating. If only they could keep their joyless world to themselves we could pretend they don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Sadly, that&#8217;s no longer possible.</p>

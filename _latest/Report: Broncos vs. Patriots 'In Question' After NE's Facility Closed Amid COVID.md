The NFL shut down the New England Patriots' practice facility Sunday following its fourth positive test for COVID-19 in the past eight days, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Schefter and ESPN's Field Yates reported the situation has put Monday's scheduled game against the Denver Broncos "in question."

The Patriots worked remotely Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Cam Newton, Stephon Gilmore and defensive tackle Bill Murray are on the team's reserve/COVID-19 list.

The game had already been pushed back from Sunday to Monday. Schefter reported the current plan remains in place, but that could shift if more New England players test positive for COVID-19.

The Patriots are on bye in Week 6 and the Broncos in Week 8, so there is no natural place in the schedule to move the game. It's likely the league would reconfigure the schedule of both teams, along with a couple of opponents, similar to how it did with last week's Pittsburgh Steelers-Tennessee Titans game.

After opening the regular season with three straight weeks of mostly normal football, the NFL has been scrambling in Weeks 4 and 5 amid outbreaks. The positive tests have cast further negative light on the NFL's plan to essentially move forward without tangible backup plans in place.

The league could have baked extra bye weeks into the schedule to account for the potential of delayed games but chose a standard 17-week slate. The NFL also could have pushed more for hard bubbles, which have proved safe for several other pro sports leagues that have returned. While there are logistical issues inherent to a bubble idea—the NFL likely would have needed regional bubbles, rather than one large bubble, because of the number of people teams employ—it would have been safer and led to less chaos.

As it stands, the NFL is having to scramble every week, all while leaving teams in a state of uncertainty about their status within a day of a scheduled game.

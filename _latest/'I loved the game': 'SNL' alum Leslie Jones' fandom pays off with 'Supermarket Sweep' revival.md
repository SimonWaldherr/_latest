Back in the day, $5,000 was a lot of money. Now, I didn't know the&#160;taxes&#160;involved and I probably would have walked away with,&#160;like, $16.62, but I still wanted to win that money.&#160;It was just such an exciting show."&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Standup comedian and former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; regular Leslie Jones hits the grocery aisles as host and executive producer of an ABC game-show revival, 'Supermarket Sweep.'"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The latest version of a format introduced on ABC in 1965 features a bigger prize &#160;&#8211; up to $100,000&#160;&#8211; as Jones teases and then quizzes three duos&#160;on their shopping knowledge&#160; before they grab as much high-priced food as they can on&#160;a supermarket set constructed in an airport hangar. Health and safety protocols&#160;&#8211; testing, masks and social distancing&#160;&#8211; were followed as production took place last summer amid the pandemic.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-television-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I tried to make it look like a normal supermarket, like maybe a Ralphs and a Whole Foods mixed together," Jones says.

It&#8217;s escaping to have&#160;joy. "Hey, you guys, we&#8217;ll probably get back to normal, but let's escape for an hour and watch some insane people run through the store and win real money and change their life and watch me make fun of 'em."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Fans love when you <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2018/02/09/leslie-jones-is-back-with-her-incredible-olympic-twitter-commentary/110252750/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">live-tweet&#160;the Olympics</a>.

Do we have an hour? The&#160;compliance nurse that was on our set the&#160;day I got there gave us this big safety (talk). After she&#160;finished explaining everything, I was kind of mad, because if this lady was on television, we would have made it through the pandemic. It was so simple&#160;as washing your hands, staying 6 feet apart, wearing your mask.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-television-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">I hope I don't get in trouble, but this is what I'm going to say:&#160;Trump could have came out on the better side of this. Only thing that he had to do was just be that person that goes, "Hey, you guys, let&#8217;s wear our masks." He could have did all the other crazy stuff and been a hero. People would have been like, "Dang, you know what? That man&#160;is looking out for us. He's our president. And he's letting us know that this is up."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>How has the pandemic affected standup comedy?</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jones: When 9/11 happened and people couldn't fly, that devastated comedians. We couldn't go to gigs anymore. This is even worse. What else is comedy but a small room with a bunch of people packed in it, breathing the same air?&#160;A lot of comedians&#160;are suffering right now. It's hard not being able to go out, but a lot of (them) are finding ways to make it happen. They have outside shows. You have clubs that do like 10 people in the (room)&#160;for social distance. People are doing online shows. You find a way to adjust. But it's&#160;hard.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Leslie Jones, left, playing Gayle King, joins Kenan Thompson as R.

Do you miss it?</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jones:&#160;No, I do not. I'm so sorry. I know that would be terrible for me to just say it like that. Of course, I learned a lot at "SNL." I love what I learned there, but I (was)&#160;47. That's a hard job. It's very restrictive. Now I'm free&#160;and y'all can really see Leslie. You can see what Leslie can do. What&#160;I learned there is great, but&#160;I don't&#160;miss the hundred hours a week. I don't miss them cold nights. I do not miss that. I miss <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/03/10/snl-spoofs-r-kelly-gayle-king-interview-cold-open/3121712002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Kenan (Thompson)</a>, though. I miss Kenan so much.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Leaving probably put a strain on your connection with Kyle Mooney. (They had an intense but&#160;fictitious relationship on "SNL.")&#160;</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jones: Yes!&#160;Oh, poor Kyle. He's always awkward&#160;anyway. What's so weird is, (until) the last season, I didn't know he had an Anita Baker thing. Our whole relationship changed when he told me he loved Anita Baker. We were inseparable after that.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Do you go to the supermarket these days?</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jones: Since I'm back in L.A., yes. Because I love Ralphs. That's where I go. The cooked food section. But there's another one out here in L.A. called Erewhon. It's like a&#160;man hair-bun-type place. But I really like the hot food section.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Is grocery shopping a different experience during the pandemic?</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jones: It is, because everybody walks around with that mask. But for me, it's cool, because&#160;don't nobody know me. I have on the cap and a mask, so I can just&#160;grocery shop.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/entertainment/tv/2020/06/22/best-tv-shows-2020-so-far/3205743001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were 'edged out' of the royal family because their 'rock star' status threatened to 'overshadow' the Queen, William, and Kate, a royal expert has claimed.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Robert Lacey - author of Battle of Brothers, a new book that examines the rift between Harry, 36, and Prince William, 38 - the younger sibling was the victim of a certain 'cruelty' from the royal family as a result of his role as the 'spare' heir.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview with <a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/royal-reveals-origins-rift-prince-harry-prince-william-73687755">GMA</a>, the royal expert claimed that this left the Duke of Sussex with a long-harbored resentment towards the Firm, which was then made all the more severe when he and Meghan, 39, began to be 'edged out' by aides who felt that they were taking too much attention away from the more senior members of the family.&#160;</p><img id="i-ba2e1e07b5faea57" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="482" width="306" alt="Competition?

To be pushed down the line of succession as babies come along, marriages come along.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was trouble with Margaret. There was trouble with Andrew. And now we have the same thing with Harry.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lacey suggests that Harry's unhappiness with his role as the 'spare' only continued to grow stronger over the years, particularly as they grew older and it became increasingly obvious that William - and his wife Kate - were being primed to take over the throne, while the younger sibling was given less attention and status.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However when the Duke of Sussex met his wife, Meghan, everything changed.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The royal author describes the former Suits star as a 'megawatt woman' who 'inspired' and 'transformed' Harry, encouraging him to take control of his own life, rather than simply living by the traditional rules and regulations of the royal family.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Meghan as the driving force, she and Harry quickly became the 'rock stars' of the royal family, Lacey explained. But while that may have done great things for the public reputation of the centuries-old monarchy, their increasingly popularity did not sit well with senior aides behind closed doors.&#160;</p><img id="i-4b9b01d52efd8a69" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="726" width="634" alt="Upset: The author called attention to the fact that most 'spare heirs' start out as equals to their older siblings, however over time this changes - as it did with William and Harry (seen in 1995)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-4b9b01d52efd8a69" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/13/34570934-8855357-image-m-60_1603112335323.jpg" height="726" width="634" alt="Upset: The author called attention to the fact that most 'spare heirs' start out as equals to their older siblings, however over time this changes - as it did with William and Harry (seen in 1995)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Upset: The author called attention to the fact that most 'spare heirs' start out as equals to their older siblings, however over time this changes - as it did with William and Harry (seen in 1995)&#160;</p><img id="i-3369ffade1add29e" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="408" width="306" alt="Early star: Lacey claims that Prince William became much more 'serious' from the age of six or seven, leaving Harry to take up the role of 'court jester'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-3369ffade1add29e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/14/34571032-8855357-image-m-64_1603112606448.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="Early star: Lacey claims that Prince William became much more 'serious' from the age of six or seven, leaving Harry to take up the role of 'court jester'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-862cfe769985b244" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="408" width="306" alt="Early star: Lacey claims that Prince William became much more 'serious' from the age of six or seven, leaving Harry to take up the role of 'court jester'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-862cfe769985b244" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/14/34571036-8855357-image-a-65_1603112616916.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="Early star: Lacey claims that Prince William became much more 'serious' from the age of six or seven, leaving Harry to take up the role of 'court jester'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="clear"></p><p class="imageCaption">Early star: Lacey claims that Prince William became much more 'serious' from the age of six or seven, leaving Harry to take up the role of 'court jester'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Duke and Duchess of Sussex bucked almost every royal tradition, which caused issues within Buckingham Palace - particularly between Meghan and the senior royal aides, who struggled to accept that the former actress wasn't willing to simply adapt to customs and practices that had been in place for centuries.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think Meghan's a force of nature that maybe Buckingham Palace hasn't worked out how to cope with. She is a woman of great conviction,' Lacey told GMA, adding that he believes there is a 'clique' of aides and royals 'who've got it in for Meghan' and did all they could to suppress her star power.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, coupled with concerns about Meghan and Harry overshadowing the most senior members of the firm - the Queen, Prince Charles, William, and Kate - prompted palace aides to work on ways to 'edge out' the couple, Lacey claims.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Small steps were taken to suppress the popularity and public status of the couple, with one of the first major signs coming in December 2019, when the Queen made her annual Christmas speech.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lacey pointed out that the monarch failed to mention Meghan and Harry by name during the address, and while she called attention to the birth of their son, Archie, her eighth great-grandchild, she did not actually say the newborn's name.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was also a very clear step taken to reduce their visibility during the speech. In 2018, a picture of the couple on their wedding day was placed in the background of the shot of the Queen, and Meghan and Harry featured in a family portrait that was placed on her desk. However in 2019, the couple were nowhere to be seen.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, the monarch made her speech at her desk, which featured a photo of Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Philip, her late father George VI, and a portrait of William, Kate, and their three children.&#160;</p><img id="i-f575d12742febbec" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="444" width="634" alt="Signs: Royal aides conspired to 'edge' out Harry and Meghan, Lacey claims, through small but clear steps, like removing their picture from the Queen's desk for her 2019 Christmas speech" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f575d12742febbec" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/14/34570792-8855357-image-m-75_1603113648166.jpg" height="444" width="634" alt="Signs: Royal aides conspired to 'edge' out Harry and Meghan, Lacey claims, through small but clear steps, like removing their picture from the Queen's desk for her 2019 Christmas speech" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Signs: Royal aides conspired to 'edge' out Harry and Meghan, Lacey claims, through small but clear steps, like removing their picture from the Queen's desk for her 2019 Christmas speech&#160;</p><img id="i-1598cd2712fafa01" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="725" width="634" alt="Message: Buckingham Palace also released a new portrait of Her Majesty and her three heirs, which Lacey says was meant to send a message to Harry and Meghan - 'remember your place'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-1598cd2712fafa01" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/14/34570924-8855357-image-m-72_1603113573676.jpg" height="725" width="634" alt="Message: Buckingham Palace also released a new portrait of Her Majesty and her three heirs, which Lacey says was meant to send a message to Harry and Meghan - 'remember your place'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Message: Buckingham Palace also released a new portrait of Her Majesty and her three heirs, which Lacey says was meant to send a message to Harry and Meghan - 'remember your place'</p><img id="i-573bccfc6adb783f" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="470" width="634" alt="Top of the line: The January 2020 portrait came just four years after the four royals were first photographed together, to mark the Queen's 90th birthday in April 2016" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-573bccfc6adb783f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/14/34570936-8855357-image-m-73_1603113593048.jpg" height="470" width="634" alt="Top of the line: The January 2020 portrait came just four years after the four royals were first photographed together, to mark the Queen's 90th birthday in April 2016" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Top of the line: The January 2020 portrait came just four years after the four royals were first photographed together, to mark the Queen's 90th birthday in April 2016</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The message here is very clear,' Lacey said.

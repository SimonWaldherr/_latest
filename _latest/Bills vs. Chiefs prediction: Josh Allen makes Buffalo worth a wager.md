  Bills vs. Chiefs prediction: Josh Allen makes Buffalo worth a wager 
description: > 
  Chiefs-Bills was supposed to be played this past Thursday night, but when the Bills’ Week 5 game was pushed to Tuesday night due to the Titans’ COVID-19 issues, this marquee matchup was moved to kick-start today’s MNF doubleheader.This game opened Chiefs -3 and was bet up to -3.5 earlier last week and has continued to steam to Chiefs -5 as of Sunday afternoon.So, this line is inflated, and we recommend the Bills plus the bonus points as we can certainly see this coming down to a field goal.Granted, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs offense is explosive, but the fact is the Kansas City defense lets good offenses keep up, and the Bills offense averages 27.8 points per game.Josh Allen is putting up Mahomes-like numbers as he’s completing 69.3 percent of his passes (compared to 63.7 percent for Mahomes), 1,589 yards (vs. 1,474), 14 TDs and 3 INTs (vs. 13 TDs and 1 INT).

<div><p>Are you ready for some Late Monday Afternoon Football?</p>
<p>Chiefs-Bills was supposed to be played this past Thursday night, but when the Bills&#8217; Week 5 game was pushed to Tuesday night due to the Titans&#8217; COVID-19 issues, this marquee matchup was moved to kick-start today&#8217;s MNF doubleheader.</p>
<p>This game opened Chiefs -3 and was bet up to -3.5 earlier last week and has continued to steam to Chiefs -5 as of Sunday afternoon. A lot of bettors are fading the Bills because of their messed-up schedule (though that didn&#8217;t do much for those who bet against the Titans last Tuesday for the same reasons). Others are expecting the Chiefs to bounce back from their 40-32 loss to the Raiders, but that&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t hold much water, either, as the Bills are also in bounce-back mode after suffering their first loss.</p>
<p>So, this line is inflated, and we recommend the Bills plus the bonus points as we can certainly see this coming down to a field goal.</p>
<p>Granted, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs offense is explosive, but the fact is the Kansas City defense lets good offenses keep up, and the Bills offense averages 27.8 points per game. Josh Allen is putting up Mahomes-like numbers as he&#8217;s completing 69.3 percent of his passes (compared to 63.7 percent for Mahomes), 1,589 yards (vs. 1,474), 14 TDs and 3 INTs (vs. 13 TDs and 1 INT).</p>
<p><strong>The Play:</strong> Bills, +5.</p>

<div><p>Stuart Blunt remembers the exact moment he knew he had something special on his hands. The British Cycling youth coach was holding a training camp in the summer of 2011 but one of his young riders, Tao Geoghegan Hart, had got stuck in the London riots.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was trying to get to the train station while all hell was breaking loose outside his front door,&#8221; Blunt recalls. &#8220;Kids he was going to school with and so on. It must have been a huge distraction. Bless him, he was just focused on his training and his racing. Tao&#8217;s got a really good perspective on things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward nine years and Geoghegan Hart, 25, is riding high at one of the biggest bike races in the world. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2020/10/18/tour-flanders-2020-giro-ditalia-stage-15-live-updates-latest/">His brilliant stage victory into the ski station of Piancavallo in the Italian Dolomites </a>on Sunday lifted him from 11th overall to fourth, just one second off the podium and 2min57sec off the overall lead.&#160;</p>
<p>Those who declared British interest in the maglia rosa over when first Geraint Thomas crashed and broke his pelvis on stage three, and then Simon Yates contracted Covid-19, are having to revise that opinion because this race looks wide open and Geoghegan Hart has as much chance of grabbing the initiative as anyone.</p>
<p>Blunt would not be at all surprised if he does. Geoghegan Hart (&#8216;Tao&#8217; pronounced &#8216;Tayo&#8217;, and &#8216;Geoghegan&#8217; pronounced &#8216;Gaygan&#8217; are Irish, Tao meaning Tom in Irish Gaelic, which is his father&#8217;s name) always stood out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to work on the talent pathway at British Cycling for 18 years now, and I&#8217;ve worked with some very talented riders,&#8221; he says of the Holloway-born rider who grew up near London Fields in the heart of Hackney. &#8220;You could go through any of them, [Tom] Pidcock, anyone. He&#8217;s right up there. Not only his physical ability but his attitude and his application. He&#8217;s very level headed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins, a fellow Londoner, called Geoghegan Hart a &#8220;geezer&#8221; following his win on Sunday, particularly enjoying the way the Ineos Grenadiers rider sized up his two breakaway companions at the finish, adjusted his sunglasses, and then out-sprinted them both.&#160;</p>

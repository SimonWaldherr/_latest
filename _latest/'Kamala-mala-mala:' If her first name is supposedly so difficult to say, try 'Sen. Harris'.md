  'Kamala-mala-mala:' If her first name is supposedly so difficult to say, try 'Sen. Harris' 
description: > 
  Recently, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) came under fire for mocking Sen. Kamala Harris’s name at a recent Trump rally, despite serving as Harris’s colleague in the Senate for three years.Even if one believes the name "Kamala" is difficult to pronounce, "Sen. Harris" is not.Similarly referring to the first Black and Asian female vice-presidential nominee as "Kamala" or "Ms. Harris" or "Sen. Harris" or “Kamala-mala-mala — I don't know, whatever” also communicates a message.Referring to Harris by her first name, pronounced "comma-la" acknowledges her personhood in a much more familiar, casual way.The mocking of her name by people in power sends a dark message that Harris is both different and insignificant.

When people take time to learn how to say my name (Nah-shu-ree) it shows respect for me, and even my very existence. My parents chose my less common name to highlight my African American heritage. My name is more common in West Africa, but there it is pronounced "N-jerry."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Growing up, I hated that no one could pronounce my name.&#160;I wanted to have a &#8220;normal&#8221; name like Hailey, Patricia, Anna or Julia&#160;&#8212;&#160;anything but Njeri.&#160;When people are dismissive of my name or don&#8217;t bother to try to pronounce it, they are communicating that I am unimportant.&#160;That was a particularly difficult message to swallow from teachers.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">I dreaded the moment in class&#160;when the teacher would come to my name in the roll call. I sat there,&#160;preparing for the laughter that was sure to follow. I have been called everything from "Nigeria" to "Jerry" by teachers.&#160;I was and continue to be good-natured&#160;about it, but I was always happier when the teacher would simply ask me for the pronunciation&#160;instead of taking a stab at it.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Today, I make it simple for my students by spelling out what they should call me phonetically &#8212; "Pro-fess-or."&#160; I usually get laughs when I tell that joke, but I'm also sending a message about respect.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Small slights, massive meanings</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The act of devaluing a person through naming is common and has a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/AA20B5B0CF67C8804CE1DAD3F203A1BA/S0010417519000070a.pdf/from_enslavement_to_emancipation_naming_practices_in_the_danish_west_indies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">long history</a>. Slaves were named by their white owners.&#160;Renaming was a practical way of keeping up with slaves, but it was also a dehumanizing way of stripping people from their heritage.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When my mother grew up in Florida, she was taught to refer to everyone with a title in front of their name out of respect.&#160;It incensed her to hear young white children refer to her own mother simply as "Hattie." It was one of those small slights that carried a big message, that her mother was not even worthy of the appearance of respect, much less genuine respect.&#160;That memory stuck with my mother, who insisted&#160;on being referred to as Dr. or Mrs. Mathis, to set expectations on how she expected&#160;to be treated.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Not a red-state, blue-state debate:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/19/kamala-harris-name-pronunciation-joe-biden-tucker-carlson-column/3387972001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Kamala Harris' name isn't difficult to pronounce.

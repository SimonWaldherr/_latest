  Tiffany Trump’s bizarre ‘Trump Pride’ rally vilified on social media 
description: > 
  Besides Trump’s off-kilter approach, which at times appeared to flirt with self-parody, the pride event evoked scorn from activists who pointed out numerous ways in which the LGBT community has been weakened by Donald Trump’s presidency — from purging trans military members from the armed forces to “religious freedom” that allow companies with federal contracts to discriminate against individuals.

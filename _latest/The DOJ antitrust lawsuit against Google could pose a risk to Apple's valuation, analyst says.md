  Mandel Ngan/Getty Images; Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit against Google could pose a risk to Apple's valuation, according to a Wednesday analyst note from Bank of America.If that agreement is determined to violate antitrust policies, it could represent a significant hit to Apple's earnings and a risk to its $2 trillion valuation.Tuesday's Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit leveled against Google could have negative implications for Apple and its $2 trillion valuation, according to an analyst note from Bank of America."The current version of the Google - Apple agreement substantially forecloses Google's search rivals from an important distribution channel for a significant, multi-year term," the DOJ complaint said.A potential solution to Google's antitrust woes could be an end to the Apple-Google revenue agreement, Bank of America hypothesized.

<div><p>The main Chinese index, the CSI 300, which tracks shares in both Shanghai and Shenzhen, has risen by nearly a fifth this year. That&#8217;s twice as much as Wall Street.</p>
<p>Heavy inflows from foreign investors have pushed the value of the renminbi sharply higher, a trend that has been exacerbated by weakness in the US dollar.</p>
<p>Although the overall valuation of the Chinese market does not look excessive, there are pockets of real over-exuberance. Just as the Nasdaq index has diverged from the rest of the US market, technology, consumer and healthcare growth stocks have parted company from stodgier petrochemical and financial shares, which are bringing the averages lower. An index of these super-charged growth shares has risen by 76pc so far this year, while value shares have basically moved sideways over the same period.</p>
<p>The long-term case for investing in China remains intact. In fact, you could argue that the shift in the world&#8217;s economic centre of gravity from West to East is just another structural theme that has been accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Coronavirus has caused some fundamental changes in the way that businesses and whole industries now operate. In particular, global supply chains are being replaced by a more regional approach, which has reduced Asia&#8217;s dependence on the health of Europe and the US.&#160;Today&#160;around 60pc of all trade in Asia happens within the region.</p>
<p>The big growth in our dependence on technology and the increasing digitisation of the economy also plays to China&#8217;s strengths. It&#160;has a strong digital infrastructure and the region as a whole is at the forefront of new technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence. Opportunities such as autonomous driving are as likely to take off in Asia, with its technological edge and more modern infrastructure, as they are in Europe or the US.</p>

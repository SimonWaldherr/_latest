Arsenal fans got a first glimpse of deadline day signing Thomas Partey in the kit as he was officially unveiled on Tuesday.

Mikel Arteta finalised a £45million switch for the Ghana international on deadline day after Arsenal paid Atletico Madrid his release clause.

After the deal was announced Partey immediately left for international duty and only travelled to north London on Tuesday for his first Arsenal photoshoot.

Partey, who will wear the No 18 at the Emirates Stadium, said he is confident he can help the club win silverware.

'It's something that is difficult and we all know that it's difficult, but we're working towards it and I think we are ready,' he said.

'We have to go all out and try to achieve all of that ourselves.

'This is our new objective. That's the objective of the club, of me myself and I think that we have to get back to where we belong.'

Partey will now have one eye on the weekend where he could make his Premier League debut. Arteta's side face the daunting task of travelling to play Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.

Should he be included, Partey could get his first outing in an Arsenal shirt at the Etihad Stadium.

Partey arrives highly-rated having left his mark playing for Diego Simeone in LaLiga.

The 27-year-old midfielder joined Atletico in 2012 and went on to make 188 appearances in the Spanish capital.

While at the Wanda Metropolitano, Partey won the Europa League as well as the Super Cup in 2018, and finished as a Champions League runner-up in 2016.

After capturing one of his top targets this summer, Arteta told the club's website: 'We have been watching Thomas for a while, so we're now delighted to add such a high quality player to our squad.

'He is a dynamic midfielder with great energy. He brings a lot of experience from a top club that has competed at the highest level in LaLiga and the Champions League for several years.

'We're very impressed with his attitude and his approach to the game.

'He's an intelligent footballer and we're looking forward to him integrating into our system and contributing to the progress we're building at the moment at the club.'

The best part of Amazon Prime Day is no doubt the deals on tech products, like headphones, laptops, TVs, and more. Usually, tech devices are expensive investments that you really have to mull over, but when a lot of the best products go on sale, it's much easier to just hit "Add to Cart." Luckily for you, Prime Day is just one day away, and some deals are already live.

Last year's Prime Day offered plenty of worthwhile discounts on tech products, and we're expecting a similar assortment of deals this year. A few upcoming tech deals have already been announced and some early discounts are live right now.

Below, we've detailed all the best tech deals you can expect across every major product category. And be sure to check out our separate hub pages for even more Prime Day product-specific deals:

When is Amazon Prime Day?

With Amazon Prime Day 2020 set for October 13 and 14, following a lengthy setback due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the company has announced several products and services that will go on sale starting October 13. With this, you'll know (some of) exactly which products are going to get the steep discounts we expect.

Whether you want a new laptop, tablet, phone, smart speaker, pair of headphones, smart home tech, or accessories, there's more than likely to be a Prime Day 2020 deal for you.

The best Amazon Prime Day tech deals live right now

It appears that Amazon has jumped the gun a bit on its Prime Day festivities, making some of its already-announced tech deals available now rather than wait for October 13. Check it out â€“ some of these are a pretty big deal (get it?):

The best Amazon Prime Day tech deals on Echo speakers announced so far

Now that Prime Day 2020 is just days away, Amazon has announced deals on not only its own lineup of smart speakers and Kindle tablets (and more), but deals for products sold on Amazon as well. Remember that the deals on these products will not go live until October 13, but you can at least start planning what to buy now.

Here are the deals announced so far for Amazon Echo speakers:

The best Amazon Prime Day tech deals on Amazon Fire Smart TVs and Fire TV devices announced so far

Amazon is hosting major discounts on its Fire TV devices for streaming video on demand and live TV, and on other brands' smart TVs with its Fire TV interface and Alexa built right in. Again, the deals on these products will not go live until October 13. Here are the deals for Amazon Fire Smart TVs and Fire TV devices announced so far:

The best Amazon Prime Day tech deals on Kindle ereaders and Fire tablets announced so far

It wouldn't be an Amazon Prime Day without deals on the Amazon hardware that started it all, the Kindle ereader, and later its color-screen spin-off, the Fire tablet. Remember that the deals on these products will not go live until October 13, but you can preview deals pricing now. Here are the deals announced for Kindle ereaders and Fire tablets so far:

The best Amazon Prime Day tech deals on smart home devices announced so far

Amazon has all but taken over the smart home scene with its Alexa technology and smart speakers, but those are only as good as the other gadgets around your home you have to control them with Alexa. As with all the deals on this list, discounted pricing will not be live until October 13. Here are the deals announced so far for Amazon smart home devices:

A preview of the best Amazon Prime Day tech deals from other product makers

Amazon has also teased discounts from several third-party retailers. However, the company was much vaguer regarding these discounts across the board, truncating deals into product lineups rather than individual discounts. Here are a bunch more tech deals that will all likely start on October 13, no sooner, straight from Amazon's recent press release:

How to shop for Amazon Prime Day tech deals

For starters, always double-check the product maker's suggested price and what the product is going for at other retailers before clicking the "Add to cart" button on. Sometimes brands inflate the value of an item before slashing the price, so it seems like you're getting a good deal, when really that sale price is pretty widely available, or the item usually retails for less elsewhere.

Likewise, don't stop your search at Amazon for Prime Day tech deals. There are plenty of other retailers offering tech discounts to compete with the 800-pound gorilla in the room, namely Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Find links to our coverage of those deals events below.

If what you're after is a brand new product or category you don't have experience with, definitely look out for editorial reviews before making that purchase decision. The user reviews on retailer sites are more often than not cooked up by the seller or third parties to drive sales, so be careful. As a team of product experts who review and write about the best tech you can buy for a living, we humbly recommend that you search for a Business Insider review or guide for any product you're looking at to see if we've had the chance to test it out personally.

When you're a high-profile reality star turned cosmetics mogul like Kylie Jenner, everyday existence often includes the jet-setting life.

And on Saturday Kylie Jenner was once again enjoying the spoils of her riches when she took a private plane to an unknown destination.

The 23-year-old Kylie Cosmetic founder posted a photo of herself from her flight while relaxing in her recliner seat that included an abundance of leg room.

The Keeping up With The Kardashians star did not share any comment in the caption, but she did relay exactly what she was thinking by sharing a white heart emoji and two plane emojis.

The white heart typically represents purity and love, while the planes obviously represent her Saturday travel schedule.

Usually one to flaunt high-fashion ensembles, Jenner opted to keep it casual in black sweatpants and a white drawstring halter top that showcased her ample cleavage.

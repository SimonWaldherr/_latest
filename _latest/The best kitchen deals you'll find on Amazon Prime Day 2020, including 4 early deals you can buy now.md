Amazon Prime Day 2020 is coming and with it, great kitchen deals. Though you probably can't renovate your kitchen with Prime Day deals alone, you can look forward to some deep discounts on countertop kitchen appliances and supplies. Whether you're an experienced home cook or a recent meal prep enthusiast, you won't want to miss out on the all-time low prices this event brings.

Amazon Prime Day is a Prime-member exclusive sale, just one of the many perks of being one. If you have yet to hop on the bandwagon, we suggest signing up for a free 30-day trial now, so you can access the exclusive event, free.

Early Prime Day kitchen deals

When is Prime Day?

Prime Day 2020 will be taking place over October 13 and 14. With this year's event so close in proximity to Black Friday, it just adds to the mass of kitchen gear discounts we usually see in the fall.

Though Amazon's the one holding the event, you can expect worthwhile deals from other retailers like Walmart and Target too. Every year these stores hop on board to offer competitive pricing for Prime Day, meaning more options for shoppers.

What kitchen deals do we expect?

Small kitchen appliances always dominate Prime Day's kitchen deals year after year. Whether you're looking for an upgrade for your baking setup or a gift with utility, appliances like blenders, stand mixers, coffee makers, sous vides, and electric pressure cookers are sure to see deep discounts, as they did over Prime Day last year.

Name brands like Instant Pot, Nutribullet, OXO, Kitchenaid, and Keurig will also be at especially low prices for Prime Day, from more than just Amazon â€” Walmart and Target have always matched those lows in years past.

Larger kitchen appliances don't usually see price drops from this event, so if you're looking for something like a new range, refrigerator, or microwave, you'll probably have to wait for Black Friday to roll around.

How to shop for small kitchen appliances and supplies:

With all of the air fryers, instant pots, and sous vide deals sure to pour in, it's important to know what you need going into the event to avoid any buyer's remorse. We've tested and written about the best of the best gear for your kitchen, so if you haven't already, here are some guides we suggest giving a read to help narrow down your search:

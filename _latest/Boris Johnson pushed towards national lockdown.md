The Prime Minister now faces an intense struggle to salvage the three-tier policy. His own scientific advisers believe the system will ultimately fail and that "circuit breakers" will be necessary, potentially every school holiday.

The deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, also appeared to have written off the tiers approach by telling Northern leaders a national lockdown was the only policy guaranteed to work.

It led to Mr Burnham accusing the Government of using Northern cities as "canaries in the coalmine" for an experimental strategy "that their own experts tell them might not work".

Hospital leaders have joined those calling for a "circuit-breaker" to ease pressure on ward beds.

Chris Hopson, the NHS Providers chief executive, said the service faced a "perfect storm" of tired staff, the loss of up to 30 per cent of capacity to keep Covid and non-Covid patients separate, and attempts to do "three things at once".

Asked whether he thought a "circuit-breaker" was required, Mr Hopson said: "My sense is what we need to do is err on the side of caution to ensure that the NHS has the capacity that it has got to treat every patient over winter... that is a yes."

Northern Ireland has already introduced a month-long lockdown, and the Welsh Government has indicated that it will announce a "circuit-breaker" over the school half-term in the coming days.

Mr Johnson has not ruled out a two-week national lockdown in England, starting at half-term, but is desperate to avoid countrywide measures.

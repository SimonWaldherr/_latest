Sergio Aguero has revealed he and Lionel Messi are 'like an old married couple' when they are on Argentina duty together.

The Barcelona star made his debut for his country in 2005, a year before the Manchester City striker joined the Argentina senior set-up.

The duo have played together at three World Cups, four Copa Americas as well as winning gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

The period of time they have spent together as a result has brought them closer together, but Aguero has insisted there are negatives to sharing a room with Messi, who came close to linking up with him at Manchester City this summer.

'He always complains, we are like an old married couple,' Aguero joked on the Santo Sabado programme via Diario Sport.

'I always fall asleep with the TV on and when I wake up the next morning he is always complaining to me.

'He arrives at the hotel and instantly takes a shower while I'm just sitting talking on my mobile phone. Then he will remind me that we need to go down to dinner and we do not have time.'

Messi played the full 90 minutes on Tuesday as goals from Inter Milan star Lautaro Martinez and Joaquin Correa sealed a 2-1 away victory for Argentina against Bolivia in their second World Cup qualifier ahead of the tournament in Qatar in 2022.

Last week, the Barcelona star scored his 71st goal for his country in a win against Ecuador.

The penalty in Buenos Aires also brought him to within six goals of Pele's tally, with the Brazilian legend the all-time top scorer for any South American nation.

The strike moved Messi on to 21 goals in World Cup qualifiers, with his former Barcelona team-mate and good friend Luis Suarez currently leading the pack on that front with 22.

Aguero, meanwhile, is Argentina's third-highest goalscorer ever and trails only Gabriel Batistuta and Messi in his country's scoring list.

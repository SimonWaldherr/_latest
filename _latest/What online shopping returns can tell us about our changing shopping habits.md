Just as shoppers who carried armloads of clothes into a fitting room might buy only one item, online shoppers are treating unboxing as a median stage in the shopping process, often filming this mundane unwrapping process for thousands of social media followers. First they order, then they receive, then they try on, and <then> they decide what to hold onto. “Something isn’t actually sold anymore until it’s kept,” says Graham Best, CEO of ReBOUND Returns, a global returns network that processes 100m transactions a year for Missguided, ASOS, Gymshark and other clients.

Early figures show that returns have surged as much as 20 percent year-on-year. On 29 June, ReBOUND logged its biggest day of returns registrations ever – even bigger than the post-Christmas returns hangover in 2019.

The items people send back read like a material diary of coming to terms with life under Covid-19. In June, July and August, people sent back swimsuits and holiday-wear; after that came a shift to returns of more optimistic purchases: unworn partywear, high-heels, handbags. “It’s psychological,” one shopper says. “I’ve found myself buying things and then sending them back when I realise I’m not going to have anywhere to wear them.”

What’s not going back are the sweatpants. “We’re seeing fewer returns,” says David James, Boohoo’s director of supply chain. “Like many brands, we have extended the returns window, so there may be a delay factor here. But we think it’s because the items people are buying, such as comfy loungewear, are items where fit is less of an issue than, say, a dress, which people order in multiple sizes.”

How retailers view returns differs depending on the audience. Most will say they’re happy to offer generous return policies because they want shoppers to purchase liberally and feel comfortable taking risks on pieces that may not be in their style comfort zones. Privately, many concede that returns can be “a nightmare” – particularly when it comes to in-demand luxury goods. A £1,000 handbag that’s marked as ‘sold out’ while it’s with a noncommittal buyer and then in returns processing is a missed opportunity for a £1,000 sale to someone who may be more likely to keep the purchase.

The likelihood of that handbag – or a dress, or a pair of jeans – being returned increases if the purchase is made online. While the average return rate in the UK for in-store shopping is five to 10 percent, the average for online shopping is 50 percent.

their ruling the judges said that 'we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of the deposition materials'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ruling said: 'The District Court correctly held that the deposition materials are judicial documents to which the presumption of public access attaches and did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Maxwell's meritless arguments that her interests superseded the presumption of access.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The District Court's order articulated and applied the correct legal framework in its individualized review of the materials to be unsealed'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The deposition stems from Ms Giuffre's defamation case against the former British socialite.</p><p

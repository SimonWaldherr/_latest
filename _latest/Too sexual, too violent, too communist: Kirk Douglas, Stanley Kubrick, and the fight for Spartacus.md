"I’m Spartacus!" "No, I’m Spartacus!" The climax of Stanley Kubrick’s Roman epic, which is now 60 years old, is one of the most iconic, admired and parodied scenes ever filmed. As the defeated slave army, led by Kirk Douglas’s Spartacus, face mass execution unless they betray their chief, they pull together as one and stirringly resist the entreaties of Laurence Olivier’s imperialistic senator Crassus.

As a piece of cinema, it is superb, but this was not the only intention that Douglas, who also produced the film, and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo had in mind. Trumbo had been one of the so-called ‘Hollywood Ten’, blacklisted and imprisoned for his communist sympathies and refusal to name names before Congress, and his script for Spartacus took the traditional generic tropes of the sword and sandals epic and gave them fresh and angry life with biting contemporary resonance.

Yet everything about Spartacus is unusual and dynamic. Although it can superficially be compared to such contemporary blockbuster epics as Quo Vadis and Ben-Hur, it is an entirely different film, closer to David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia in its thoughtful script, moral ambiguity and, in its restored version, provocative sexual content. It occupies a unique place in Kubrick’s distinguished filmography as being his only work that he did not originate himself, and yet its themes and mise-en-scène remain entirely Kubrickian, acting as a precursor to much of the rest of his work.

It features two distinct styles of performance, contrasting English actors working within a theatrical, Shakespearean tradition and American film stars entirely aware of the power of the big screen. And, many years after its initial release, it underwent a painstaking restoration that brought back one of its most famous scenes that had been deleted on initial release for being too racy.

"It was a very internal and intimate seed that sprouted into this huge thing," the actor Peter Ustinov, who won an Oscar for his performance as the wily slave trader Batiatus, would later say of his involvement in the film. "The executives were rather nervous about the whole thing at the beginning, because of the absence of the Christian element, the Hays Code and the blessings, which would have been invaluable for the publicity department."

Oasis star Noel Gallagher's daughter Anais has posed for a very risqué international lingerie campaign, admitting: 'I haven't told my dad yet!'

The 20-year-old daughter of the rocker and his ex Meg Mathews is modelling fashion brand Bluebella's highly provocative new autumn/winter collection, and kept the shoot a secret from Noel, 53.

Having shown Meg, 54, right away, Anais said of her father: 'This will be the first time he has seen them - but he is very open about what I do.

'I think any father would be happy with this message of their daughter being empowered, and that's exactly what this is.

'My mum was very happy about me modelling for Bluebella and I showed her the photos before anyone else.

'Like most young women I'm a bit self-conscious with pictures of myself and I wasn't confident about how I looked. But mum said to me, "Are you mad, they are amazing!" As soon as she said that I was completely OK with them, and they are really great.

'My dad doesn't know about the pictures. I've not told him. He knows I'm an adult who is quite vocal about my life and about what I choose to do.'

Having shown Meg, 54, right away, Anais said of her father: 'This will be the first time he has seen them - but he is very open about what I do'

Of fronting her first major lingerie campaign, she said: 'I personally love Bluebella's ethos of not wearing lingerie for anyone else. It's for you, which totally ties in with how I like to live my life.

'It's so important to do things and have little things that make you happy, especially in times like the ones we're living in right now.'

In the racy snaps, the blonde poses in a quartet of red ensembles: a semi-sheer two-piece, a plunging lace number, an intricate teddy with cut-outs and a daring bra-panty combo with suspenders.

She wears similar get-ups in black lace, posing around an ornate set in front of a window and reclining in a bathtub.

In the latter, she wears chunky boots for an extra touch of edginess.

She went on: 'I think any father would be happy with this message of their daughter being empowered, and that's exactly what this is'

She added: 'Like most young women I'm a bit self-conscious with pictures of myself and I wasn't confident about how I looked. But mum said to me, "Are you mad, they are amazing!" As soon as she said that I was completely OK with them, and they are really great'

Cloak and dagger: 'My dad doesn't know about the pictures. I've not told him. He knows I'm an adult who is quite vocal about my life and about what I choose to do,' she said

Anais weighed in on her rebellious father's opinion that wearing face masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic is pointless.

'I get where he's coming from but I'm less full on than him, I'm generally less revolutionary than my dad. I've never not worn a mask,' she admitted. 'I think my generation is quite lenient and that's not necessarily a good thing.

'We do what we're told a bit too much, we come from the era of fake news and Facebook telling us what the news is.

'We are also hugely afraid of being cancelled. It's very dangerous to stand up and be your own person in my generation, if you are going against the grain, you can be totally cut out.'

Sultry: 'It's so important to do things and have little things that make you happy, especially in times like the ones we're living in right now,' she added

Happy: Anais has ditched her bustling life in London for a quieter dwelling in Dorset, after moving to the countryside with her boyfriend Julius Roberts

Anais admits that she is the 'complete opposite' of her party-loving parents and spent lockdown living on boyfriend Julius Roberts' organic farm near Lyme Regis in Dorset, where she was up at 6.30AM most mornings to bottle feed the lambs.

Anais told Bluebella that the countryside is where she feels at home now and that she has never wanted the rock 'n' roll lifestyle that her parents enjoyed.

She said: 'My parents are famously [into partying] and they love going out, and they are very social and I'm completely the opposite. The rock 'n' roll lifestyle was never my thing.

'I think I have rebelled in the opposite direction by deciding to live on a farm in the countryside with my boyfriend.

Party girl: Her mother Meg Mathews recently revealed she would regularly spend thousands of pounds on drink and drugs during her wild days

Carefree: Meg said she went off the rails during her four-year marriage to Noel

Brief romance: The wild pair, pictured at the Brits in 1997, divorced after Noel met his future wife, the publicist Sara MacDonald, in an Ibiza club

Binges: Meg, pictured in 1998, said she would regularly get trashed at the exclusive London hotel Claridge's

'There's a lot of pressure with living up to your parents and I was never going to live up to them in terms of who could party hardest. I thought it best to step out of the race for this one.'

Reflecting on her teens, she said: 'When I was around 15 or 16, on a Saturday night mum would ask what I'm up to and I'd say I'm just staying in and watching TV or reading a book.

'Then later my friends would call round and they'd say, "Is Anais coming to the party tonight?" She was really worried I was wasting my youth by not going out and partying.'

Anais is now back living with her mum in Primrose Hill, North London, while completing the final year of her photography degree.

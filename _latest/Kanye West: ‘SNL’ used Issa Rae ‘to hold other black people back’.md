<div><p>Issa Rae&#8217;s first time hosting &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; is all thanks to Kanye West, according to the rapper.</p>
<p>During a sketch on the late night comedy show this weekend, the &#8220;Insecure&#8221; creator and star was depicted as a fictional black political advocate who supports voting for &#8220;everybody black&#8221; on election day, except when it comes to Ye.</p>
<p>The bit, which also featured Kenan Thompson, 42, as the &#8220;Your Voice Chicago&#8221; talk show host and &#8220;SNL&#8221; co-star Ego Nwodim, 32, as a journalist for the Root, was inspired by Rae&#8217;s own comments during the 2017 Emmy Awards that she was &#8220;rooting for everybody black.&#8221;</p>
<p>The character played by Rae, 35, was asked about several imaginary political black candidates with widely varied and sometimes questionable credentials, all of whom she supported, pointing out what could make them uniquely qualified.</p>
<p>But not West.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kanye? &#8216;F&#8217; him,&#8221; her character responded at the notion of the rapper running for president &#8212; who <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/16/kourtney-kardashian-wears-vote-kanye-hat-faces-backlash/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is on the ballot</a> for vice president in some states, next to third party candidate Roque &#8220;Rocky&#8221; De La Fuente.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Jesus Is King&#8221; rapper, 43, didn&#8217;t find anything funny about Rae&#8217;s satire, and took to Twitter to denounce the sketch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always said SNL uses black people to hold other black people back,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1317819037036941313?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he tweeted</a> on Sunday morning. &#8220;My heart goes out to Issa Rae. I&#8217;m praying for her and her family. I know that the twenty years of service that I&#8217;ve paid in the entertainment field has furthered our ability to be more successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>His followers were then quick to point out his many appearances on the show &#8212; a six-time musical guest, no less.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were you holding back here, while hosting SNL?,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremynewberger/status/1317819769408659462" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked filmmaker Jeremy Newberger</a>.</p>
<p>For her part, Rae ended her stint on Saturday&#8217;s show by urging audiences to &#8220;get out there and vote.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sadiq Khan has accused Boris Johnson of lying to the House of Commons, after he claimed that Transport for London had been&#160;"effectively bankrupted" by the London Mayor.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was challenged by several MPs over conditions being imposed on TfL as a result of acrimonious bailout talks, including extending the congestion charge as far as the North and South Circulars and ending free travel for the under-18s.&#160;</p>
<p>Although he failed to respond to the substance of the questions, Mr Johnson claimed: "The current Mayor of London had effectively bankrupted TfL before coronavirus had even hit and left a massive black hole in its finances.</p>
<p>"Any need to make up that deficit is entirely down to him, it is entirely his responsibility.</p>
<p>"Any expansion of the congestion charge or any other measure taken to improve the finances of TfL are entirely the responsibility of the bankrupt current Labour Mayor of London."</p>
<p>He added that&#160;TfL's finances had been&#160;left in "robust" shape but destroyed by "grossly irresponsible, demagogic policies".</p>
<p>After PMQs,&#160;Mr Khan tweeted: "The PM has lied to the House of Commons. Before Covid I was fixing his mess at TfL- reducing the deficit by 71 per cent&#160;since 2016.</p>
<p>"Covid-19 is the sole cause of TfL&#8217;s challenges. The PM wants to increase fares, the congestion charge &amp; taxes - and end free travel for children and older Londoners."</p>

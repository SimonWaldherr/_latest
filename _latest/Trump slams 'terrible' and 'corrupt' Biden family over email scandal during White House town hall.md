  Trump slams 'terrible' and 'corrupt' Biden family over email scandal during White House town hall 
description: > 
  Trump pointed to a Fox News report claiming that Joe Biden was promised 10 percent equity in a deal with a Chinese energy firm that Hunter Biden allegedly helped broker 2017.'They're trying to protect [Biden] because that's the way it is with the Democrats, that's part of the Democratic Party.''I have no problem with it, I have no problem with a mask,' Trump replied.Fauci did suggest in a March interview that it was not necessary for people to wear masks - prior to when the CDC made a formal facial covering recommendation in early April.Later in the town hall Trump asserted that the only reason the US has most cases out of any country is because of testing.

China should have stopped it,' he added.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump's immediate response did not account for the rising coronavirus infections across the country, including in the Midwest and other reasons, or the nation continuing to lead in the death toll.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Public health officials have pointed to a lack of social distancing, continued gatherings, reopenings despite high positivity test rates, and people's refusal to embrace mask wearing and other steps.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With more than eight million cases, the US continues to lead the world, and is far ahead of other wealthy countries with advanced health systems.

A spokesperson for Dr Fauci has also said he &#8220;is not affiliated or registered with any political party, nor does he endorse any political party or candidate&#8221;.</p><p></p><p>The epidemiologist has served under and worked with every single president since Ronald Reagan, when he was an instrumental figure in the fight against AIDS.

And here I am, they're sticking me right in the middle of a campaign ad. Which I thought was outrageous. I was referring to something entirely different.

He&#8217;s been here for 500 years.

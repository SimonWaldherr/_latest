With summer officially around the corner, we’re dreaming of sunny days and outdoor bike rides. And just because we’re on coronavirus lockdown doesn’t mean we can’t find a way to responsibly jet set (even if it’s just for a few miles on a sweet cruiser). Below, some of our favorite essentials — with a festive, tropical twist — that will keep you and your ride in style.

The wheel deal

Warmer days call for a cruiser in this sunny hue.

Heady stuff

Helmets are essential: This one wins for its easy-to-close magnetic buckle.

A top that pops

The short sleeves make this shirt a no-fuss layering piece.

Flower power

Carved from an actual coconut and large enough to hold a bottle of water, this cup holder is the perfect blend of practical and kitsch.

Move and groove

A tie-dye print gives this sporty one-shoulder top a relaxed vibe.

Cute kicks

Retro florals for summer are cute (and comfortable!).

In the bag

For hands-free convenience, wear this limited edition bum bag messenger-style or around your waist.

Darling denim

A high-waisted summer staple with a colorful twist.

All about that face

This cotton mask is designed with adjustable straps and is both hand-washable (with soap and water) and reusable.

Bling my bell

Because every bike needs a festive bell.

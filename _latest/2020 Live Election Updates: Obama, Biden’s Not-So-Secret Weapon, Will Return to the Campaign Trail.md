Pennsylvania, with its deep-blue cities, deep-red rural areas, purple suburbs and cache of 20 electoral votes, is a deeply divided state and one of several Mr. Biden must win if he is to wrest the White House from President Trump.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Both candidates have criss-crossed the state in recent weeks &#8212; Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/21/us/trump-biden-election/trump-says-before-the-coronavirus-he-never-planned-on-campaigning-in-erie-pa-we-had-this-thing-won" title="">spoke in Erie</a> Tuesday night &#8212; and while Mr. Biden has maintained a steady lead in the polls there, surveys released in recent days <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/presidential-polls-trump-biden/interpreting-polls-in-wisconsin-and-pennsylvania" title="">show the race tightening</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1318741515649372166" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video posted to Twitter</a> on Tuesday evening, Mr. Obama offered a preview of the rally, telling young people that they can create &#8220;a new normal&#8221; in American politics by going to vote.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;One of the most inspiring things about this year has been to see so many young Americans fired up, organizing, marching and fighting for change,&#8221; Mr. Obama said<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1318741515649372166" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">.</a> &#8220;Your generation can be the one that creates a new normal in America.

Major streamers, YouTube stars and TikTok influencers now play it for millions of fans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">At the peak on Tuesday night, more than 400,000 users were watching Ms. Ocasio-Cortez play Among Us with a handful of popular streamers, making her debut one of the most-watched streams in the service&#8217;s history. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Her fellow gamers included Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who suggested in several tweets she was enjoying herself.  </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you&#8217;re winning: <a href="https://t.co/Fu7CMyCQDA">pic.twitter.com/Fu7CMyCQDA</a></p>&#8212; Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1318734076862517256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2020</a></blockquote>

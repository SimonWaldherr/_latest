 <p>     </p> <p>Additionally, a yellow warning has been issued for severe gales across south-east England, mainly around the Kent and Sussex areas, on Wednesday between 7am and 5pm, with gusts of 45 to 55mph inland and 65mph near the coast.</p> <p>The warnings come as Storm Barbara, named by Spanish meteorologists, is to unleash torrential downpours across Spain and Portugal - before moving in on the UK - with some areas possibly seeing the equivalent of four to six weeks' worth of rain in just a few days.</p> <p>Meanwhile, four flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - have been issued in Loughborough, Climping and along parts of the Cornish coast.</p>

 <p>Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said: "There will be a band of rain moving in from the south, bringing some at times heavy rain, particularly in the South East, and then following that later in the day, a period of stronger winds, particularly again in the South East."</p> <p>Mr Claydon said winds could be particularly strong across "exposed coastal locations" and through the Dover Strait.</p> <p> He said the UK can expect "unsettled" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> for the rest of the week. </p>

 <p>"That wind and rain clears off into the North Sea and after that we're left with a continued spell of unsettled conditions across the UK through the week," he said.</p> <p>"There will be periods of slightly more settled conditions and at times brighter weather as well, so there will be some sunshine around.</p> <p>"But generally remaining broadly unsettled, with further wind and rain to affect the UK through the weekend as well."</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

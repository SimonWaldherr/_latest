<div><p>Canada concluded China&#8217;s actions against ethnic Uighurs in the Xinjiang province constituted a genocide and called for sanctions</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" class="u-underline">China</a> has warned Canadian lawmakers to halt their &#8220;blatant interference&#8221; in its internal affairs, in the latest episode of a rumbling diplomatic feud between the two nations.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Canadian parliamentary committee concluded China&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/24/china-has-built-380-internment-camps-in-xinjiang-study-finds" class="u-underline">actions against ethnic Uighurs in </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/24/china-has-built-380-internment-camps-in-xinjiang-study-finds" class="u-underline">Xinjiang province</a> constituted a genocide and called for sanctions against officials complicit in the government&#8217;s policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Witnesses were clear that the Government of China&#8217;s actions are a clear attempt to eradicate Uyghur culture and religion,&#8221; the committee wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1825949.shtml" class="u-underline">Speaking to reporters</a> late on Thursday, China&#8217;s foreign minister Zhao Lijian condemned the committee&#8217;s findings, saying the report was &#8220;full of lies and disinformation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Zhao also used his press conference to level a warning, urging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" class="u-underline">Canada</a> to &#8220;exercise caution in its words and deeds&#8221; in order to &#8220;avoid further damage to China-Canada relations&#8221;.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s response underscores the extent to which relations between the two nations continue to sour.</p>
<p>Last week, only days after the two countries observed the 50-year anniversary of diplomatic relations, China&#8217;s ambassador to Canada, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/16/china-ambassador-makes-veiled-threat-to-hong-kong-based-canadians" class="u-underline">Cong Peiwu accused Canada</a> of encouraging &#8220;violent criminals&#8221; as it considered granting refugee status to Hong Kong pro-democracy activists.</p>
<p>Deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said Cong&#8217;s remarks were &#8220;not appropriate&#8221; for a diplomat. &#8220;Let me also reassure the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong that a Canadian is a Canadian and we will stand with them,&#8221; Freeland said. Meanwhile, Conservative opposition leader Erin O&#8217;Toole, called for an apology from Cong or face expulsion.</p>
<p>In recent years, Canada and China had both expressed hope of building stronger ties. But the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 marked a fatal blow to relations between the two nations.</p>

<p>China quickly retaliated, detaining Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/19/china-charges-two-detained-canadians-spavor-kovrig-with-alleged-espionage" class="u-underline">charging the pair</a> under dubious &#8220;espionage&#8221; charges. Canada has repeatedly called for the men, who have been held for more than 650 days in &#8220;arbitrary detention&#8221; to be released.</p>
<p>China temporarily halted canola and pork exports last year, a move that cost industry millions in losses. Canada has mulled barring Huawei from building 5G mobile infrastructure in the country, citing security concerns.</p>
<p>On Thursday Zhao said Canada&#8217;s report on the Uihgurs had &#8220;turned a blind eye to the political stability&#8221; in the region and represented parliament&#8217;s &#8220;ignorance and prejudice&#8221; on the topic.</p>
<p>Foreign minister Fran&#231;ois-Philipe Champagne said he welcomed the report&#8217;s findings, but did not confirm if the federal government would impose sanctions on Chinese officials.</p>

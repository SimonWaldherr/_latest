  Behind in Polls, Republicans See a Silver Lining in Voter Registrations

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Voter registration numbers alone are not predictive about the outcome of races: Democrats had a surge in voter registrations in 2018, and went on to win the House of Representatives but lost some races in key states where they had an overall registration edge.

Party registrations are driven in some states by local and congressional races as much as the presidential race, too.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Trump-Biden contest this fall may be driven less by incremental changes in registration than by who turns out to vote, and how much they want the president to have a second term or not. And the difference of a point or two in voter registration only makes a difference in a close race.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Analyzing voter registration &#8212; and how it might affect the outcome of the looming election &#8212; is also complicated by the fact that a number of states permit same-day voter registration. In addition, at least six <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/election-states-biden-trump.html" title="">battleground</a> states &#8212; Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin &#8212; do not break down voter registration by party, though Democrats point to some perceived gains there.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In Georgia, for example, of the 800,000 voters who have registered since 2018, 49 percent are people of color, according to the organization Fair Fight, which was founded by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/elections/trump-is-in-georgia-trying-to-shore-up-support-in-a-critical-battleground-state.html" title="">Stacey Abrams</a>, a Democrat who narrowly lost the race for governor in the state in 2018.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Those are Democratic-leaning voters,&#8221; Ms. Abrams said during an appearance last week with Jill Biden, Mr. Biden&#8217;s wife, in suburban Atlanta, where early-voting turnout is setting records.</p></div>

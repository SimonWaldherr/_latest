He'd previously worked in legal roles at eBay and internet pioneer Netscape, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kent-walker-5963bb198/">LinkedIn profile</a>, and spent several years as a federal prosecutor in the 1990s.</p><p>His signature line is on the company's <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.257903/gov.uscourts.cand.257903.3.1_1.pdf">2012 settlement</a> with the federal government relating to advertising, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140904googleplayorder.pdf">a 2014 settlement</a> related to in-app purchases, and a 2019 settlement related to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/172_3083_youtube_coppa_consent_order_signed.pdf">children's data privacy</a>.</p><p>Walker's fans described him as level-headed, a "lawyer's lawyer" who keeps his head down and focuses on business, according to the Bloomberg profile, which said his duties spanned antitrust matters, privacy, the ethics of AI, the company's activities in China, and employee discontent over sexual harassment and other matters.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Halimah DeLaine Prado</strong></h2><p>DeLaine Prado, Google's general counsel, has been with the search giant since 2006 and risen through the ranks.

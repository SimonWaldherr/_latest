Like Trump , Melania painted their coronavirus experiences as a positive one.

"In one way I was glad the three of us went through this at the same time so we could take care of one another and spend time together," Melania wrote. Trump was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center the same day he announced that he and Melania tested positive.

"We are in unprecedented times – and with the election fast approaching, it has been easy to get caught up in so much negative energy," she wrote. "It also cheered me to think of all the people I have met across our country and the world – and the goodness and compassion that exists if you seek it out. Our country has overcome many hardships and much adversity, and it is my hope COVID-19 will be another obstacle we will be able to tell future generations we overcame – and learned from in the process."

The first lady detailed her experience with the virus, saying she had "minimal symptoms" that included body aches, coughing, headaches and feeling "extremely tired most of the time."

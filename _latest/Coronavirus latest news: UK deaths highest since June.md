<p>Deaths from coronavirus in the UK have reached their highest level since June 5 after a further 241 people died. &#160;</p>
<p>Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van Tam said he expected the upward trend in coronavirus deaths to continue.</p>
<p>Mr Van Tam, speaking at a press conference, said: "Part of that surge in deaths is related to the weekly pattern of slightly lower figures at the weekend, and then a kind of catch-up earlier in the week.</p>
<p>"But overall is the trend upwards? Yes. "Do I expect the trend in deaths to continue upwards? Yes, unfortunately I do."&#160; The deaths figure on June 5 was 258.</p>
<p>Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, said: "The trend in deaths is rising sharply.</p>
<p>"Tragically we know that older people and those with underlying health conditions tend to suffer more if they become unwell."</p>
<p>It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Manchester would move into Tier 3 restrictions despite local leaders and the Government failing to &#160;come to agreement on a financial package.</p>

<div><p id="speakable-summary">Shares of consumer video service <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank">Netflix </a> are down sharply after the bell today, following the company&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/FINAL-Q3-20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Q3 earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>Why is Netflix suddenly worth about 5% less than before? A mixed earnings report, a disappointing new paying customer number, and slightly slack guidance appear to be the answer.</p>
<h3>The numbers</h3>
<p>Heading into the third quarter, <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/FINAL-Q2-20-Shareholder-Letter-V3-with-Tables.pdf">Netflix told investors</a> that they should expect it to generate revenues of $6.33 billion, operating income of $1.25 billion, and net income of around $954 million, worth about $2.09 in earnings per share.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>Today, Netflix reported $6.44 billion in revenue, operating income of $1.32 billion, along with $1.74 in per-share profit off of net income of $790 million.</p>
<p>Netflix bested its revenue goals, but fell short on profitability.</p>
<p>The company also managed to best analyst revenue expectations of $6.38 billion, while missing out on analyst per-share profit <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/analysis?p=NFLX">expectations</a> of $2.13.</p>
<p>Adding to the pain, Netflix also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/netflix-growth-q3/">missed expectations on new customer adds</a>. In its Q2 earnings, Netflix said that it &#8220;forecast[ed] 2.5m paid net adds for Q3&#8217;20 vs. 6.8m in the prior year quarter,&#8221; because its &#8220;strong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today Netflix reported just 2.2 million customer adds, missing its own targets and sharply missing analyst expectations of <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3623379-netflix-q3-2020-earnings-preview">around 3.3 million for the period</a> (some <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/20/netflix-nflx-earnings-q3-2020.html">analyst counts</a> had an even higher guess).</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Netflix says that in Q4 it expects revenues of $6.57 billion, operating income of $885 million, $615 million in net income, earnings per share of $1.35, and 6.0 million new paid customers in the period. The street had been looking for $6.58 billion in top line, and just $0.94 in per-share profit, so it&#8217;s hard to parse which part of the forecast is driving more investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Regardless, today&#8217;s earnings report will not move Netflix&#8217;s share price too far from its recent, all-time highs. The company may take a ding from its profit miss, but nothing material.</p>

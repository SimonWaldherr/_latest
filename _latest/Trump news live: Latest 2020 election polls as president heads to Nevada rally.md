Donald Trump dances on stage after speaking during a campaign rally in Janesville, Wisconsin on Saturday

At a rally in the state on Saturday, Mr Trump targeted Gretchen Whitmer several times, criticising Michigan’s rules to stop the spread of coronavirus, calling her “dishonest” and making light of a plan uncovered by the FBI to kidnap her.

In rally on Saturday, the president accused the Democrats of wanting to “erase American history" and “purge American values" and claimed, with no basis, that Democratic rival Joe Biden would put communities at risk.

His dark message comes as the president faces a seemingly uphill battle to win re-election, with national polling and surveys in crucial battleground states showing his Democratic rival in the lead.

Meanwhile, thousands of mostly young women in masks rallied in the American capital and other US cities, urging voters to oppose Mr Trump and his fellow Republican candidates in the upcoming elections.

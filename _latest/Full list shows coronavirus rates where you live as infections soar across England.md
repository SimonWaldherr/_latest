Nottingham remains England's coronavirus hotspot - with a rate that has rocketed to 760.6 - but has still managed to escape local lockdown restrictions.

The Midlands city's rolling seven-day rate has soared to 760.6 new cases per 100,000 people from 158.3 in just one week, with 2,532 new cases recorded in the seven days to October 6.

The median age of people testing positive has dropped to 21.

Knowsley has the second highest rate, which has jumped from 391.1 to 657.6, with 992 new cases.

Liverpool is in third place, where the rate has also increased sharply, from 419.0 to 599.9 with 2,988 new cases.

Tougher restrictions are expected to be announced by the Prime Minister on Monday.

Boris Johnson could introduce a new three-tier "traffic light" system for local restrictions in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and avoid a second national lockdown.

In Nottingham, local leaders have called on the Government to impose restrictions on the city and urged residents not to wait for Monday's announcement.

The Government told residents to follow "the advice of the local authority".

Three-quarters of Nottingham's new positive cases in the past seven days were among people aged 18-22. The median age of people testing positive has dropped to 21.

The University of Nottingham has 1,448 positive cases among its staff and student population - the most at any higher education institution - according to figures from the University and College Union.

The Isle of Wight (12.0) has the lowest infection rate in England, followed by Gosport (16.5), Torridge (17.6), Fareham (18.1) and Folkestone and Hythe (20.4).

The latest Covid-19 rates, for the seven days to October 6, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (pillar one of the Government's testing programme) and in the wider community (pillar two).

The rate is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 people.

Data for the most recent three days (October 7-9) has been excluded as it is incomplete and likely to be revised.

The list has been calculated by the PA news agency and is based on Public Health England data published on Friday October 9 on the Government's coronavirus dashboard.

Here is the list in full. From left to right, it reads: name of local authority; rate of new cases in the seven days to October 6; number (in brackets) of new cases recorded in the seven days to October 6; rate of new cases in the seven days to September 29; number (in brackets) of new cases recorded in the seven days to September 29.

DETROIT – Just because they weren't successful doesn't mean they weren't dangerous.

This is what the prosecution argued in court Friday in convincing a judge to order six men to stand trial on charges they plotted for months to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer because they were angry over her lockdown order.

"Was it a good plan?" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler argued in court Friday, adding: "It doesn't look like they discussed it much."

And it cost them, he said.

"These people got caught because they're amateurs," Kessler said, stressing that just because the plan failed "it doesn't mean it wasn't dangerous."

U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Berens agreed in concluding the government had probable cause to charge the six defendants with conspiracy to kidnap, despite objections by defense lawyers who called the kidnap claims "outlandish" and "absurd."

Berens also denied bond to four defendants this week. The accused ringleader, Adam Fox, consented to detention, which means he agreed to remain locked up pending the outcome of his case. A sixth suspect in the case was denied bond in Delaware and is awaiting extradition to Michigan.

All face up to life in prison if convicted.

Defense attorneys repeatedly argued in court this week that there was no real plan to kidnap Whitmer, but just angry gun enthusiasts talking tough among each other. They scoffed at allegations that the ringleader in the group wanted to take Whitmer out on a boat and leave her stranded in Lake Michigan.

They also balked at another claim that the group wanted to kidnap Whitmer and drive her to Wisconsin and try her for treason.

Who was going to drive her to Wisconsin? Where would she be tried? The defense lawyers asked, suggesting there was no real plan, just puffery.

"Really? Was there really an agreement here, or is it just loose talk,?" said defense attorney Scott Graham, claiming "common sense" suggests this was "loose talk."

"It's so outlandish," Graham said. "Was the agreement to cast her in a lake? ... That's how absurd it all is."

Following two days of testimony, however, Berens concluded there was sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy to kidnap charge, citing, among other things, the surveillance of Whitmer's vacation home in the middle of the night.

The five members ordered to stand trial on a conspiracy to commit kidnapping are:

Adam "Alpha F--- You" Fox, 37, of Potterville

Ty Garbin, 25, of Hartland Township

Kaleb Franks, 26, known as "Red Hot"

Daniel Harris, 23, known as "Beaker"

Brandon Caserta, 32, known as "Debased Tyrant"

Barry Croft, 44, of Bear, Delaware, was also denied bond this week and is awaiting extradition to Michigan to face the conspiracy charge.

A credible threat or just talk?

Defense lawyers tried for two days to convince the judge that their clients deserved to be free on bond, arguing that the suspects were lawful gun owners who held training exercises, potlucks and even enjoyed playing paintball.

The FBI, though, had been watching the group for months and embedded paid informants and undercover agents in the group who recorded conversations and videotaped certain activities that led to criminal charges.

Attorney Mark Satawa, who is representing Garbin, argued that his client is a hard worker from a good family who has no criminal record. He asked the judge to release his client on bond and let him live with his parents, with a tether for added security. He argued that Garbin has "no criminal history at all," has a good job making $28 an hour as an airline mechanic, and that his father, an Army veteran, could keep an eye on him.

"There is nothing that my client could do to endanger the community under those set of circumstances," Satawa argued. "Lock Mr. Garbin up, sure. But at home."

Kessler disagreed, arguing Garbin participated in a dangerous plot to kidnap the governor, and was more than a "bystander." Kessler told the judge that Garbin was actively involved in the plot in many ways, including:

He cased the governor's vacation home at night.

He texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down.

He offered to paint his boat for "night fishing" as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake.

He had the ability to manufacture guns.

All of this, Kessler said, warranted keeping Garbin locked up, stressing neither his parents nor electronic devices could ensure the public's safety.

"He could leave," Kessler argued. "And we wouldn't know where he was."

According to an FBI affidavit, the accused ringleader, Fox referred to Whitmer as a "tyrant b----itch" with "no checks and balances" who needed to be taken down. Fox lived in the basement of a Grand Rapids-area vacuum store with his two dogs, according to courtroom testimony.

The FBI says Fox was a member of the Michigan Home Guard militia group but left that group for unknown reasons, FBI agent Richard Trask testified this week. He then became associated with members of the Wolverine Watchmen group, but it is not clear he ever became a member of the group, Trask told the court.

Fox was also associated with a group called the Michigan Patriot 3%, and was listed on a Facebook page as its leader or president, Trask testified. The agent testified he was not aware of Fox having connection with a group known as "bugaloo," which is a far-right anti-government movement.

An affidavit filed Thursday in a related case involving eight state defendants said Fox was a leader of the "Michigan III%ers," which the affidavit said was involved in planning "various acts of violence," including kidnapping politicians and storming the state Capitol in Lansing.

In court documents, the FBI portrays Fox as a rogue militia leader who looked for like-minded individuals on social media to wage a civil war against government officials he believed were overreaching. He was especially angry about Whitmer's lockdown order, court records show, and feared gun rights were at risk.

Fox's family has declined comment.

Defense: Case is just beginning

Following court appearances Friday, lawyers for the suspects continued to cast doubt on whether it was a serious plan or just one idea that was tossed around.

"We heard them describe several things, from a talk at the Capitol, demonstration at the Capitol, to possible kidnapping, to other things that they planned to do but never did," said Douglas Parker, attorney for Daniel Harris, in an interview following his client's morning appearance in federal court.

"So it raised questions for me. I don't know all of the messaging that went around between members. I don't know how many ideas they had to do things that they never followed through with, and that's one thing we (the defense attorneys) were all pulling out was, there's a bunch of talk — is there anything to it?"

Parker said his client, Harris, did not participate in the nighttime surveillance of Whitmer's vacation home. Prosecutors have used the surveillance trip, among other evidence, as proof that the plot was much more than "big talk."

"We're in such an early period," Parker said. "All I want people to know is that we're still in the early part of this case. We don't even have all the evidence that the government does, so all I'd say is keep an open mind, and until a jury says otherwise, these people are as innocent as you and I."

Satawa, a Southfield-based lawyer for Garbin, echoed Parker during interviews after the hearing on Friday. Satawa suggested freedom of speech and assembly would be key issues in the defense strategy.

“Lots of people own lots of guns. If I sit here and I say, ‘We’ve got to take Trump down,’ referencing the Nov. 3 election, am I committing a crime just because I own guns? Or does it take more than that?

“We believe that when the full story is told our client will be vindicated in this case, but that needs to happen in there in the courthouse," said Satawa, "and not out here and in the newspapers.”

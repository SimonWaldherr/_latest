Until this month, Simon Segars had not seen his new boss in person. Arm’s chief executive and Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s billionaire founder, have been in constant contact for months as Huang negotiated a $40bn (£31bn) takeover of the British microchip company. But despite the two living only a short Silicon Valley drive away from one another, this had been done entirely over Zoom.

The two were eventually pushed into proximity out of necessity, taking part in a panel discussion for developers at Arm’s virtual conference last week to answer questions about the deal. “That’s the first time I’ve seen Jensen in the flesh for a very long time,” says Segars. “We didn’t have a face-to-face meeting through the whole process.”

Since Sept 13, when Nvidia announced it had agreed to buy Arm from the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, there have been plenty of questions to answer.

Veterans of the UK tech industry, including Arm’s co-founder, have attacked the deal, claiming it jeopardises the future of Britain’s most successful technology company.

Arm’s customers – many of whom compete with Nvidia – have been calling the company, demanding assurances the sale will not put them at a competitive disadvantage.

And regulators are preparing to cast their eyes over the sale, particularly in China, which fears a famously neutral technology falling into American hands in the middle of a trade war.

Given Arm’s importance to the global technology industry, as well as Britain’s, that is unsurprising.

The company’s microchip designs, which squeeze maximum performance out of low power consumption, have made Arm’s technology central to the smartphone revolution, wearable devices and, increasingly, connected cars and the ubiquitous “internet of things”.

Some 180bn chips have been produced using its technology since the company was founded in 1990 as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple and Silicon Valley’s VLSI.

Segars, 52, has been with Arm since the beginning. He joined as one of the company’s first employees, and was put in charge of engineering shortly after its London flotation in 1998, before moving to the US to run global sales. In 2013, he replaced Warren East as chief executive, and was due to return to the UK until SoftBank swooped with a £24bn takeover offer, weeks after the Brexit vote.

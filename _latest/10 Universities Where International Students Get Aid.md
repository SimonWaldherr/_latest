The U.S. News Short List, separate from our overall rankings, is a regular series that magnifies individual data points in hopes of providing students and parents a way to find which undergraduate or graduate programs excel or have room to grow in specific areas. Be sure to explore The Short List: College, The Short List: Grad School and The Short List: Online Programs to find data that matters to you in your college or grad school search.

College is expensive, but international students studying in the U.S. often face tuition price tags much steeper than those paid by U.S. students.

International students accounted for 5.5% of the total U.S. higher education population in the 2018-2019 academic year, according to the latest data available from the Institute of International Education, but they provide a significantly higher proportion of many institutions' tuition revenue. In that same year, international students contributed nearly $41 billion to the U.S. economy, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators.

And unlike their U.S. counterparts, international students are often not eligible for the financial aid that can help bring down college costs. To qualify for federal student aid, for example, students must be U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens, such as lawful permanent residents.

However, some colleges offer institutional aid to international students.

In an annual U.S. News survey, among the 461 ranked colleges that reported providing at least 50 international students aid during the 2019-2020 school year, the average amount was $23,410.

Some schools are even more generous: Among the 10 universities that offered international students the most financial aid, the average amount was $68,569. Columbia University in New York awarded the highest average amount of aid in 2019-2020, providing nearly 300 international students with an average of $71,069. Columbia is also the most expensive private school in the country, with tuition and fees at $64,380 for the 2020-2021 school year.

All of the colleges making this top 10 list are private institutions. They are located primarily on the East Coast, in states like New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Many of these institutions are also ranked in the top 10 among National Universities, schools that are often research-oriented and offer bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees, and among National Liberal Arts Colleges, which emphasize undergraduate education and award half or more of their degrees across liberal arts fields.

Harvard University in Massachusetts, for example, is ranked No. 2 among National Universities and provided an average of $66,805 in aid to international students in 2019-2020. Williams College, also in Massachusetts, is ranked No. 1 among National Liberal Arts Colleges and provided an average of $68,456 in aid to international students that same year.

While Arizona State Universityâ€”Tempe, a public school, did not make this list, it provided the largest number of international students with aid among all ranked colleges that provided U.S. News with this information. In 2019-2020, ASU awarded 2,803 international students an average of $4,737 in financial aid.

Below are the 10 schools that gave the most in financial aid to at least 50 international students during the 2019-2020 school year. Unranked schools, which did not meet certain criteria required by U.S. News to be numerically ranked, were not considered for this report.

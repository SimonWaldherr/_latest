  Le'Veon Bell on Joining Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs' Offense: 'I Can't Wait' 
description: > 
  Seth Wenig/Associated PressRunning back Le'Veon Bell is excited to join the dynamic Kansas City Chiefs offense, which, frankly, should come as no surprise.Schefter also reported Bell believes the Chiefs offer him the best opportunity to win a Super Bowl.He was a three-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro selection who topped 1,200 rushing yards and 600 receiving yards three times in five years.Bell should have plenty of room to operate with defenses focusing on the aerial attack featuring Mahomes, Kelce and Tyreek Hill, among others.He will also share time with Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the backfield, which will help him remain fresh as he chases a Super Bowl title.

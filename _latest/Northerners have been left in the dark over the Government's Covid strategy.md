<div><p>Back in March, people across Britain readily accepted restrictions on normal life. However, the original lockdown dragged on far longer than anticipated. This was despite the fact that although the spike in hospitalisations was rapid, it soon diminished. The achievement of delivering the Nightingale Hospitals should not be understated &#8211; but they were barely used.</p>
<p>All the while, scientists and doctors learnt and shared best practice with friends around the world. Existing safe and effective drugs, as well as medical techniques, are now far better applied than in the early days. Survival rates and recovery are on the rise and will improve further.</p>
<p>The lockdown policy <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/11/long-can-keep-locking-nothing-left/">has had a heavy cost</a>. The national debt is now at a post-war high and it will take many more years to even begin balancing the budget. Many have been made unemployed and have no hope of getting a job any time soon. School leavers find there is no work to be had. Even those who get lucky discover that working in a cramped bedroom in a tiny flat is pretty depressing.</p>
<p>Students at university are <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/06/shouldnt-swaddling-students-covid-let-us-take-risks/">isolated in their halls and feared by local residents</a> because mass testing has created a spike in positive tests, even though few felt as if they had more than the mildest of autumn colds. Children at school have taken the biggest hit, with many receiving the barest level of education for six months. They now risk their entire year group being sent home because of one positive test. And they will have to pay the national debt.</p>
<p>Millions of GP and hospital appointments have been cancelled or simply not attended out of fear, so we are creating a physical and mental-health time bomb. MPs get regular updates about economic matters but we should have one about the lockdown health impact.</p>
<p>The borough of Bolton has seen 20,000 fewer GP to hospital referrals so far this year. What has been missed and what is the cost? With more extreme lockdowns and circuit breakers looming, have the British people been asked if the price is worth it? Have we even been given the information to reach a judgment?</p>
<p>I fear that we are repeating the early mistakes. The country has already had a three-month lockdown. Bolton has suffered for even longer. Both lockdowns failed on their own terms and yet, rather than taking a new approach, we are pressing repeat. This dither and delay cannot be the &#8220;new normal&#8221;.</p>

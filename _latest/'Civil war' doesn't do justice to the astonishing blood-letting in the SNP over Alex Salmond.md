And, we should never lose sight of the fact that this battle with the man who’s her former mentor is taking place while First Minister Sturgeon is trying to lead the country through perhaps the most dangerous pandemic in recent history.

Her outburst is also a clear signal that she sees the continued sniping by Mr Salmond’s allies, who claim she was part of a conspiracy to discredit him, is damaging both her leadership and her hopes of winning a majority in next year’s Scottish elections - leading, she hopes, to al second referendum on independence.

Moreover, obviously fed up with being attacked she attempted to turn the tables on Mr Salmond by saying of him: "He was facing serious allegations of sexual misconduct.

"All along I have tried to do the right thing and not covered it up and I think the reasons perhaps why he is angry with me – and he clearly is angry with me – is that I didn’t cover it up, I didn’t collude with him to make these allegations go away and perhaps that is at the root of why he is as annoyed as he appears to be.”

If true, this is a serious allegation against Mr Salmond. Here we have a claim from the present First Minister that her predecessor - a senior politician, a privy councilor, a former First Minister asked her to ‘cover up’ allegations of sexual misconduct.

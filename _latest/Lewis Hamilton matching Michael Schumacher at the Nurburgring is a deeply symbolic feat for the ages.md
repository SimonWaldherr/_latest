Be in no doubt that Hamilton registers the magnitude of what he has just accomplished. He grew up idolising Senna and was just a nine-year-old karting prodigy, watching on from his Stevenage living room, when Schumacher won the first of his world championships with Benetton in 1994. “An incredible honour,” he said, having received the same helmet his predecessor wore during his final Mercedes campaign. “It’s going to take some time to get used to.”

Naturally, those who deny Hamilton a place on the same pedestal as Schumacher will point to the superiority of his team, winners of a record six straight drivers’ and constructors’ titles. Not only does this conveniently forget the technical advantages at Schumacher’s disposal in the Ferrari years, it understates the sophistication of Hamilton’s craft. Already peerless over a single flying lap – 96 poles to his predecessor’s 68 attests to that – he is extraordinarily error-free on Sundays, last finishing outside the points in Austria 27 months ago.

If it were all about the car, then why is Valtteri Bottas, given the same machinery, 69 points behind Hamilton after just 11 races? Events at the Nürburgring did much to illustrate how Hamilton’s supremacy lies in the details. The huge lock-up that cost Bottas the lead is the type of error Hamilton has long since eliminated from his repertoire. His gifts are such that even a blindingly quick Finn has been left for dust.

A key factor in why Stewart has withheld the highest praise from Hamilton is the vast difference between their eras. When Stewart was racing, the Nürburgring was the “Green Hell”, a 13-mile leviathan where even the slightest error could prove fatal. The leaps forward in F1 safety have ensured, mercifully, that such peril is mitigated for Hamilton’s generation. But to deny him his due would be churlish. Tentative though his country still is to embrace him, Hamilton has delivered a feat for the ages.

Surgeons in Nottingham have been told to cancel some non-urgent operations after facing “rapidly escalating demands” due to coronavirus infections.

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said the city is facing a “serious situation” following a rise in cases in the region, which has forced them to postpone some non-urgent procedures.

In a message sent to staff on Friday, Nottingham University Hospitals Trust’s medical director and chief nurse said the action was needed “to create capacity for emergency patients”, according to The Independent.

The message also raised concerns about nosocomial spread within the hospital, in which patients test positive for Covid-19 following admission.

It follows a recent analysis by the University of Oxford, which found up to a quarter of patients in hospital with Covid-19 had caught the virus following admission.

Professor Carl Heneghan, who led the research, said: "Once you start to get into the data, it's not as simple as cases rising or hospitals admissions rising. This shows there is a significant problem with healthcare-acquired infections."

By postponing or cancelling some surgeries, it is hoped some operations could still go ahead at East Midlands hospital, while preventing potentially infectious patients entering the hospital.

Facebook has defended offering unbreakable encryption to its users despite a warning from seven countries that it “creates severe risks to public safety”.

Ministers from the “Five Eyes” intelligence sharing alliance of the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand published a statement on Sunday which called on technology companies to build ways to regularly hand encrypted private messages to police and governments.

Facebook said the company had "long argued that end-to-end encryption is necessary to protect people's most private information."

"In all of these countries, people prefer end-to-end encrypted messaging on various apps because it keeps their messages safe from hackers, criminals, and foreign interference," the Facebook spokesman added.

The social network said is would continue to develop "high security" ways for people to communicate.

Facebook's position on encryption stands in defiance of the joint statement by seven countries. “We urge industry to address our serious concerns where encryption is applied in a way that wholly precludes any legal access to content,” the countries wrote.

Creating unbreakable encryption, where technology companies cannot read messages sent by their users, “poses significant challenges to public safety, including to highly vulnerable members of our societies like sexually exploited children,” the governments added.

The countries stopped short of condemning all forms of encryption, however, and noted that strong encryption “plays a crucial role in protecting personal data, privacy, intellectual property, trade secrets and cyber security.”

The statement was signed by home secretary Priti Patel as well as representatives of India and Japan, countries which are not formally part of the Five Eyes alliance.

<div><p>O.J. Simpson took a stab at making light of the Jeffrey Toobin situation.</p>
<p>The Juice compared Toobin to Pee-wee Herman in a short video clip posted to his Twitter just hours after the CNN analyst&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/jeffrey-toobin-was-masturbating-in-front-of-new-yorker-bigs-report/">masturbation scandal</a> broke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daaaaamn, Jeffrey Toobin. At least Pee-wee Herman was in an X-rated movie theater,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealOJ32/status/1318348497272238080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simpson said in the clip</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m just saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toobin, who famously chronicled Simpson&#8217;s murder trial for the New Yorker in the 1990s, was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/jeffrey-toobin-was-masturbating-in-front-of-new-yorker-bigs-report/">caught pleasuring himself</a> on a Zoom call with several other top New Yorker scribes last week.</p>
<p>Pee-wee Herman, whose real name is Paul Reubens, was arrested in 1991 for masturbating in a public theater.</p>
<p>The New Yorker writer, who also serves as a legal analyst on CNN, said Monday that he made an &#8220;embarrassingly stupid mistake&#8221; after several people <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdgm4/new-yorker-suspends-jeffrey-toobin-for-zoom-dick-incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Vice</a> they saw him masturbating while on the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believed I was not visible on Zoom. I thought no one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video,&#8217;&#8217; Toobin told the news outlet.</p>
 
<p>Toobin was participating in an election simulation with noted New Yorker writers including Jane Mayer, Evan Osnos, Masha Gessen and Jelani Cobb, when he was spotted pleasuring himself on screen.</p>
<p>At some point during the simulation, there was a break for writers to strategize amongst themselves &#8212; and a number of people on the call <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/new-yorker-suspends-jeffrey-toobin-for-showing-penis-during-zoom-call/">saw Toobin</a> begin to masturbate.</p>
<p>New Yorker editor David Remnick said in an e-mail to staffers that Toobin had been suspended after the flashing incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please be assured that we take such matters seriously and that we are looking into it. Best, David,&#8221; Remnick said.</p>
<p>Toobin turned his coverage of the trial into a bestselling book, which later became the hugely popular &#8220;The People vs. O.J. Simpson&#8221; FX miniseries in 2016.</p>
<p>Toobin, a Harvard Law School grad, will also be taking a break from his legal analyst job at CNN amidst the scandal.</p>

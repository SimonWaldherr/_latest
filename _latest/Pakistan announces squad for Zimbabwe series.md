<div><p>Head coach and chief selector, Misbah-ul-Haq today named 22 probable players for the ODI and T20I series against Zimbabwe, insisting he has opted for experience in the 50 over matches and provided extended run to the youngsters in the T20I format.</p>

<p>He said, &#8220;The National T20 Cup saw some outstanding individual performances. A few leading performers may feel disappointed that they have been unable to break into the squad. But, I want to reassure them that they will remain in consideration for the New Zealand tour and early next year&#8217;s home series. All they now need to do is to carry those impressive run of forms in the upcoming domestic competitions."</p>

<h3>Shielding is the answer for Manchester, Johnson told <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3e6"> </a></h3>
<p>Manchester MPs and city leaders have&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3e7">urged Boris Johnson to introduce shielding</a>&#160;for the elderly and vulnerable in the region instead of bringing in new lockdown restrictions. The Prime Minister is expected to announce today that Greater Manchester will be placed into the highest tier of Covid measures, with or without the consent of its leaders. Late last night, Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, said local leaders have until noon to reach an agreement on restrictions or be forced to comply with a Tier 3 lockdown. It comes after senior Tory MPs backed a move by the leader of Manchester City Council to shield those most at risk, claiming that would cost only a fifth as much as a Tier 3 lockdown while allowing businesses to stay open. Downing Street was also&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3e8">accused by an expert of massaging statistics</a>&#160;to justify putting Manchester in the tightest restrictions.&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3e9">Our coronavirus liveblog</a>&#160;will keep you up to date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Downing Street has been forced to&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3ea">remind ministers to wear face masks</a>&#160;after the Health Secretary was caught travelling in a chauffeur-driven car without one. Matt Hancock, who has been a keen advocate of face coverings, was spotted without a mask while travelling in a ministerial car to the Department of Health and Social Care on Monday. No 10 has since reminded ministers that they must wear masks when travelling as passengers in cars.&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3eb">Read on for more</a>.

<h3>GCHQ blocked employment of non-white applicants</h3>
<p>British intelligence services&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3ed">"blocked" the employment of non-white applicants</a>&#160;until the 1980s, an authorised history of GCHQ has found. History professor John Ferris was commissioned to write the first official history of the agency as part of its efforts to open up more to the public in its centenary year. The book says that, by adhering to the Foreign Office's "four British grandparents" rule for applicants, designed to enhance security, GCHQ effectively "blocked admission to non-white applicants" until around 1980.&#160;<strong>Dominic Nicholls&#160;</strong>also reveals how the book suggests there were&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3ee">tensions between the British and American signals intelligence organisations</a>&#160;around the time of the Falklands War.</p>
<h3>Diana note denying BBC dirty tricks goes missing</h3>
<p>A handwritten note by Diana, Princess of Wales, exonerating the BBC over murky claims surrounding forged documents and exploitation might be expected to be kept tightly under lock and key. But as new allegations emerge about exactly how Martin Bashir managed to secure that bombshell Panorama interview 25 years ago, mystery surrounds one piece of evidence that should alleviate both the presenter and the corporation.&#160;<strong>Victoria Ward</strong>&#160;outlines&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3ef">the claims of the new Channel 4 documentary</a><strong>&#160;</strong>- and the conundrum of the critical note. Meanwhile, Diana's son, the Duke of Cambridge, has&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6efacc38,39cc53e1,36bec3f0">expressed fears of a "mental health catastrophe"</a>&#160;if the entertainment sector collapses due to Covid-19.</p>

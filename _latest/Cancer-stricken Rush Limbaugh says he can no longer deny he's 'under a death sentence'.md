<div><p class="speakable">Cancer-stricken talk radio legend <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rush-limbaugh-advanced-lung-cancer" target="_blank">Rush Limbaugh</a> provided listeners a somber update on his condition Monday after recent scans showed &#8220;some progression of cancer,&#8221; which he said is &#8220;not dramatic&#8221; but still a step in the wrong direction.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="speakable">Limbaugh announced&#160;in&#160;February&#160;that he was diagnosed with&#160;advanced&#160;lung cancer&#160;and had missed&#160;several shows this month to undergo treatment.&#160;&#160;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rush-limbaugh-advanced-lung-cancer" target="_blank">RUSH LIMBAUGH ANNOUNCES HE HAS 'ADVANCED LUNG CANCER'</a></strong>&#160;</p><p>&#8220;From the moment you get the diagnosis, there&#8217;s a part of you every day, OK, that&#8217;s it,&#160;life&#8217;s over, you just don&#8217;t know when,&#8221;&#160;Limbaugh said. &#8220;So, during the&#160;period of time&#160;after the diagnosis, you do what you can to prolong life, do what you can to prolong a happy life. You measure a happy life against whatever medication it takes.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Limbaugh, who recently hosted President Trump for a two-hour interview, continued the&#160;devastating update on his diagnosis.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough to realize that the days where I do not think I&#8217;m under a death sentence are over,&#8221; Limbaugh continued. &#8220;Now, we all are, is the point. We all know that we&#8217;re going to die at some point, but when you have a terminal disease diagnosis that has a time frame to it, then that puts a different psychological and even physical awareness to it.&#8221;&#160;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rush-limbaugh-conservatives-react" target="_blank">RUSH LIMBAUGH'S SHOCKING CANCER DIAGNOSIS SPURS SUPPORT, WELL WISHES</a></strong></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>The conservative radio icon then explained that he&#160;received bad news earlier&#160;this month&#160;during treatment.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;The scans did show some progression of cancer. Now, prior to that, the scans had shown that we had rendered the cancer dormant. That&#8217;s my phrase for it. We had stopped the growth. It had been reduced, and it had become manageable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s always the reality and the knowledge that that can&#160;change&#160;and it can come back because it is cancer. It eventually outsmarts pretty much everything you throw at it.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Limbaugh said that his treatment program has been adjusted&#160;with&#160;chemotherapy drugs&#160;&#8220;in hopes of keeping additional progression at bay for as long as possible,&#8221; but he&#8217;s happy to be on the air while he can still do it.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/rush-limbaugh-cancer-types-risk-factors" target="_blank">RUSH LIMBAUGH'S CANCER DIAGNOSIS: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT ITS TYPES AND RISK FACTORS</a></strong>&#160;</p><p>&#8220;I feel very blessed to be here speaking with you today. Some days are harder than others. I do get fatigued now. I do get very, very tired now. I&#8217;m not&#160;gonna&#160;mislead you about that. But I am extremely grateful to be able to come here to the studio and to maintain as much normalcy as possible -- and it&#8217;s still true,&#8221; he said.&#160;&#8220;You know, I wake up every day and thank God that I did. I go to bed every night praying I&#8217;m&#160;gonna&#160;wake up.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>Limbaugh said he understand many listeners are going through their own struggles and offered advice.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;Someone told me &#8212; I think this is good advice, may be helpful &#8212; the only thing that any of us are certain of is right now, today. That&#8217;s why I thank God every morning when I wake up,&#8221; he said.&#160;I thank God that I did. I try to make it the best day I can no matter what. I don&#8217;t look too far ahead. I certainly don&#8217;t look too far back.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>Limbaugh&#160;told listeners he never thought he would make it to Oct. 1 when he was first diagnosed earlier this year.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;It is of immense value, strength, confidence, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m able to remain fully committed to the idea that what is supposed to happen will happen when it&#8217;s meant to. There&#8217;s some comfort in knowing that some things are not in our hands,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of fear associated with that, too, but there is some comfort. It&#8217;s helpful &#8230; God, is it helpful. It&#8217;s helpful to be able to trust and to believe in a higher plan.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Limbaugh received the Presidential Medal of Freedom during Trump&#8217;s State of the Union address only a few days after first&#160;informing&#160;listeners of his diagnosis.&#160;&#160;</p><p>&#8220;The Rush Limbaugh Show&#8221; first aired in 1988 and has earned a variety of awards and honors.

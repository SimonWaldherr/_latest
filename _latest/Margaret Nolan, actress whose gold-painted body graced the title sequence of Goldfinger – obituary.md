<div><p>Margaret Nolan, who has died of cancer aged 76, made her first impression &#8211; and a lasting impact &#8211; on screen as the model clad in a leather bikini, her body painted gold all over, for the opening title sequence of the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger.</p>
<p>Robert Brownjohn designed the sequence, influenced by the 1920s Bauhaus photographer Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, in which footage from this third 007 movie and its predecessors is seen projected across her body.</p>
<p>Combined with Shirley Bassey&#8217;s stirring rendition of the title song the effect is witty and risqu&#233;, in the spirit of the period: one of the images shows a golf ball appearing to roll down Margaret Nolan&#8217;s cleavage. It was said to be the first title sequence to require clearance from a film censor.</p>
<p>Margaret Nolan was just 20 when she was asked to appear, after working as a model and landing a couple of small roles on screen. Her answer was yes &#8211; if she could also have a part in the film. So she became a &#8220;Bond girl&#8221; twice over, also playing Dink, a masseuse applying her therapy to Sean Connery&#8217;s 007 at a Miami Beach hotel.</p>
<p>With her star in the ascendant, she landed small roles in two 1964 film musicals, the Beatles&#8217; A Hard Day&#8217;s Night, as a young woman at a casino encouraging Wilfrid Brambell, as Paul McCartney&#8217;s poker-playing grandfather; and Ferry Cross the Mersey, as an art student hanging around with Gerry and the Pacemakers and other Merseybeat groups.</p>

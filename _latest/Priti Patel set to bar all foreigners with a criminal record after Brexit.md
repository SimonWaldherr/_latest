<div><p>Foreigners with a criminal conviction in the past year could be banned from entering the UK under a post-Brexit immigration crackdown on overseas offenders.</p>
<p>Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, has widened her planned UK ban on criminals <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/07/12/eu-criminals-year-jail-will-banned-britain-tough-new-immigration/">jailed for more than a year</a> to include people from both the EU and non-EU countries with less serious convictions.</p>
<p>Under the changes to be laid before Parliament on Thursday, the UK will ditch <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/22/priti-patel-pledges-new-laws-bar-deport-foreign-criminals-abuse/">the current &#8220;soft&#8221; EU rules</a> that only allow&#160;immigration officials to ban anyone who poses &#8220;a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new rules, which take effect on January 1, 2021, will bar all foreign criminals, including those from the EU sentenced to at least a year in jail, from entering the UK.</p>
<p>Any foreigner coming to the UK for first time, who has been jailed for less than a year, will also be barred from entering. Any visitor or new arrival who has a non-custodial sentence in the previous 12 months, such as a drink drive conviction, could also be barred.</p>
<p>A foreign criminal with a sentence of less than 12 months, but who has ties to the UK through residence or relatives, could still be barred but&#160;will be dealt with on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>The Home Secretary will reserve the right to bar persistent offenders or anyone whose presence in the UK &#8220;is not conducive to the public good.&#8221; The Government will also have the power to remove rough sleepers from the UK &#8220;as a last resort&#8221; if efforts to get them accommodation and benefits, or citizenship through the EU settlement scheme, are rebuffed.</p>
<p>The Home Office admitted attempts to deny entry could be <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/17/judges-reined-using-human-rights-laws-block-deportations/">thwarted or delayed if someone claimed it was a breach under the European Convention on Human Rights</a>, or if their criminal offence was not recognised in the UK.&#160;</p>
<p>Ms Patel said: &#8220;For too long, EU rules have forced us to allow dangerous foreign criminals, who abuse our values and threaten our way of life, onto our streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK will be safer thanks to firmer and fairer border controls where foreign criminals, regardless of nationality, will be subject to the same criminality rules.&#8221;</p>

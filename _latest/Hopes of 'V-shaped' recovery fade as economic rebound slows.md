The economy’s recovery stumbled in August even as Rishi Sunak’s dining discount provided much-needed relief for restaurants.

Hopes of a rapid V-shaped recovery were dashed by GDP rising by a far weaker-than-expected 2.1pc compared with July, a fourth month of expansion following the record collapse during lockdown, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The accommodation and food services sector contributed about 60pc of growth in August, buoyed by the Chancellor's Eat Out to Help Out scheme and the staycation boom. More than 100m meals were served using the discount, which provided up to £10 off for every diner on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August at a cost of £522m.

However, the growth data revealed that other industries and the wider economy lost momentum even before new Covid restrictions were introduced. Economists warned the economy could see no growth in September, describing the outlook as "bleak" ahead of a long winter for businesses and workers.

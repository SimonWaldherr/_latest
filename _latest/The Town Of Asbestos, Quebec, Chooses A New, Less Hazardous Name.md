<p>The residents of Asbestos, Quebec, have selected a new name. Going forward, the town will be known as Val-des-Sources &#8212; valley of the springs &#8212; rather than the name of the carcinogenic mineral mined in the town until 2011.</p>   <p>The town, about 80 miles east of Montreal, has watched as its namesake transformed from being an asset in the late 1800s to a liability in recent decades.</p>   <p>The area was home to Jeffrey Mine, once the largest chrysotile asbestos mine in the world, the CBC <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/asbestos-quebec-renamed-history-1.5765156">reports</a> &#8212; and the town grew up around it. According to historian Jessica Van Horssen, the town got its name when the Royal Mail simply started calling it after the mineral.</p>   <p>Asbestos is naturally occurring and was once widely used for insulation. But the fibers can be toxic if inhaled<a href="https://www.epa.gov/asbestos/learn-about-asbestos#effects">, increasing the risk of lung disease</a>. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://www.epa.gov/asbestos/epa-actions-protect-public-exposure-asbestos">banned</a> certain uses of asbestos since 1973. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2018/10/the-government-of-canada-takes-measures-to-ban-asbestos-and-asbestoscontaining-products.html">A ban</a> on asbestos-containing products went into effect in Canada in 2018.</p>   <p>"Once upon a time, we have been very proud of that name, but now it's very difficult because asbestos means a fiber that people are afraid of," Louise Moisan-Coulombe, the town's former mayor, told the CBC.</p>   
    

    <p id="ad-backstage-News_World" class="ad-backstage"></p>

   <p>"Every time you say, especially in the United States, that you are coming from Asbestos, or they read Asbestos on a package, they are always afraid that it will be poison."</p>   <p id="res925827389" class="bucketwrap statichtml">
            
   </p>
   
 
   <p>The winning name was a late entry: After a shortlist of finalists <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/city-of-asbestos-canada-renamed-val-des-sources/index.html">came under criticism</a>, a <a href="https://ville.asbestos.qc.ca/a-propos-de-la-ville/changement-de-nom/">new list of six options</a> was put forth.</p>   <p>So in a drive-in vote held in recent days in a local parking lot, the town selected a new future. Residents age 14 and older could participate, and nearly 2,800 townspeople cast a vote &#8212; almost half of those who were eligible. </p>   <p>It was thus decided: Absestos will become Val-des-Sources, which captured 51.5% of the vote.</p>   <p>The name is slated to change officially in December.</p>   <p>"This is truly a historic moment we are living. I thank the people for voting in large numbers,"<a href="https://ville.asbestos.qc.ca/actualites/le-nouveau-nom-sera-val-des-sources/?fbclid=IwAR3LwPzV8MTIzwdykQVxXxBYfS70f6b568o8oMI3mD_TEPv6MzFIlpd_19A"> </a>Mayor Hugues Grimard <a href="https://ville.asbestos.qc.ca/actualites/le-nouveau-nom-sera-val-des-sources/?fbclid=IwAR3LwPzV8MTIzwdykQVxXxBYfS70f6b568o8oMI3mD_TEPv6MzFIlpd_19A">said</a> in a statement. "The council and I are proud to see that the process was able to rally the citizens. We can thus affirm that the name Val-des-Sources is one to which citizens adhere."</p>   </div>

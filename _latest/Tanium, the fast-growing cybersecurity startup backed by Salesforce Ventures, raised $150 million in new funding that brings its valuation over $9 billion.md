The cybersecurity firm Tanium raised $150 million in new funding, it announced this week, at a valuation that is says is "over" its previous $9 billion figure.

In June, Salesforce Ventures and Tanium announced a "strategic investment." At the time, Tanium did not disclose how much funding it raised in that round, only that it brought the company to a $9 billion valuation. CNBC reports that the round was $100 million.

In September, Tanium brought on former Ford CEO Mark Fields as its lead board member as it transitioned to 5G.

This story was originally published on Thursday, October 8th. It was updated on Friday, October 9th with more information about the funding round, including clarification that this new financing doesn't include the Salesforce Ventures investment.

Tanium, one of the most valuable cybersecurity companies in the industry, announced it has raised $150 million in new funding this week, giving it a valuation of "over" $9 billion, according to a company press release.

That represents an uptick in valuation from June, when the company said that it took a "strategic investment" from Salesforce Ventures that was announced in June. The company didn't disclose the amount of that investment at the time, though it said that it valued the company at $9 billion — making this new funding a slight up-round. CNBC's Ari Levy reports that the Salesforce Ventures investment clocked in at $100 million,

"Existing investors Fidelity Management & Research Company, LLC, Baillie Gifford, their respective affiliates, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. participated in the financing," the company said.

An official company filing hints that Tanium, founded in 2007 by the father and son team David and Orion Hindawi, could still raise more funding as part of this round: The company said it sold about $150.5 million out of $200 million in securities offered to a total of 26 investors, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission Form D filed on Monday. The filing was first spotted by CRN's Joseph Kovar.

Tanium declined to make CEO Orion Hindawi available for an interview.

Tanium describes itself as a "unified endpoint management" platform, simplifying the process of protecting a wide variety of employee devices — which is especially important in the new era of remote work.

It has seen its value soar since 2018, when the firm was valued at $6.5 billion. The company said this week that it has now raised over $900 million in total. Besides Salesforce Ventures, Tanium is also backed by firms including Andreessen Horowitz and TPG.

The cloud-software giant Salesforce, the parent of Salesforce Ventures, also recently partnered with Tanium to help IT teams manage employee devices and services on their networks.

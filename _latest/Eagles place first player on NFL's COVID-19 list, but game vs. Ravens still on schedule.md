The Philadelphia Eagles placed right guard Matt Pryor on the NFL's COVID-19 list Friday, meaning that Pryor either had tested positive or was exposed to someone who has.

Pryor is the first Eagle to go on the list during the regular season.

The NFL Network reported Friday that Pryor did not test positive and has no symptoms. But he apparently came into contact with someone who did test positive.

It appears that will not affect the Eagles' game this Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens.

Pryor had missed practice both Thursday and Friday with what the team listed as an illness.

The Eagles had four players listed as being out Thursday with an illness. The other three – defensive tackle Hassan Ridgeway, offensive lineman Jamon Brown and linebacker Shaun Bradley – returned to practice Friday.

The NFL's protocol is to keep players home if they're experiencing any kind of cold or flu-like symptoms.

Brown, a veteran free agent signed last month, will start in Pryor's place.

"We've got to take everything into precaution, whether a guy has an upset stomach or he's got a headache or he's got whatever it could be," Eagles coach Doug Pederson said Friday morning, before Pryor went on the COVID-19 list. "It doesn't even have to be COVID related. We have to take everything seriously, and we've got to protect the entire team and the organization."

The NFL has already postponed a few games and shut down some team facilities, when positive cases have been reported. Had Pryor tested positive, the Eagles would have had to shut down their facility as well.

The Eagles had three players on the COVID list this summer upon reporting for training camp in right tackle Lane Johnson, tackle Jordan Mailata and linebacker Nathan Gerry.

In addition, Eagles head coach Doug Pederson tested positive early in training camp and worked remotely for 10 days.

Pryor joins a long list of Eagles players ruled out for the game Sunday. The others are injury related. They are RT Lane Johnson (ankle), WR DeSean Jackson (hamstring), WR Alshon Jeffery (foot), LB Duke Riley (rib), S Marcus Epps (rib) and CB Avonte Maddox (ankle).

Jackson and Maddox are missing their third consecutive game, while Jeffery has yet to play this season.

As for Brown, he has started 47 games in his career that began in 2015 with the Los Angeles Rams. The Eagles have used six different combinations on the offensive line this season.

Rookie Jack Driscoll will start in place of Johnson, who has left the last two games because of his ankle, which he had surgery on in August.

Brown said he understands the NFL's use of caution regarding COVID-19.

"A guy like myself trying to prepare for the Baltimore Ravens, and missing a day due to minor symptoms, it’s good and bad," he said. "You want the league to take the precaution to make sure everybody’s safe. But then, when you’re looking at trying to prepare for a football game, you kind of want the opposite, you know what I mean?

"I think the league is doing a great job, trying to just keep a handle on everything, trying to navigate this new space that we’re in."

The Eagles are allowing about 6,000 fans into the stadium on Sunday for the first time this season.

Asked if he would be comfortable going if he were a fan, Brown replied: "If I was a fan, yes, with a mask, I definitely would."

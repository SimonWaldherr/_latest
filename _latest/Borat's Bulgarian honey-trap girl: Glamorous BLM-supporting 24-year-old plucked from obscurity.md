  Borat's Bulgarian honey-trap girl: Glamorous BLM-supporting 24-year-old plucked from obscurity 
description: > 
  The actress who honey-trapped Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the new Borat movie has been revealed to be a glamorous BLM-supporting 24-year-old from Bulgaria who was plucked from obscurity for the role.Giuliani accused Hollywood of deliberately leaking details of his appearance in the Borat movie to stifle coverage of the Hunter Biden story.When he set the alarms off, he lied and said he had a defibrillator, Cohen told Dowd.The film arrives just as Giuliani finds himself in the middle of the Hunter Biden laptop saga.The Post reported that emails from 2015 showed Joe Biden held a meeting with a top official from Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.

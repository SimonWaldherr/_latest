Wolfgang Van Halen is remembering his rockstar dad Eddie Van Halen days after his death with a childhood photo revealing a softer side of the eccentric and wild musician.

Known simply as Wolf, the 29-year-old bassist — and Michael Anthony’s replacement in Van Halen since 2006 — shared an adorable black and white photo of himself as a toddler being read to by his guitarist father on Instagram. He chose not to caption the photo, allowing the heartfelt image to speak for itself.

“Love love love this photo💕 Your dad is watching over you Wolf ❤️🙏✨,” wrote one supporter, with another adding, “Truly sorry for your loss. We all are saddened by this. The mark he left on us will go on for generations to come ❤️.”

Wolf’s mother, Valerie Bertinelli, has also shared family photos in remembrance of her ex-husband, posting several snapshots to her Instagram Stories of her time with the legendary artist, including one of them hugging on the night they first met. She also shared a second picture from that evening — Aug. 28, 1980, in Shreveport, La. — of them smiling for the camera.

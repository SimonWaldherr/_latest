title: > 
  First taste of freedom for hairdressers and golfers but crackdown on AFL parties 
description: > 
  As Stage Four restrictions eased ever so slightly on Monday, many Melburnians wasted no opportunity in making the most of it.Long suffering golfers hit the links across metropolitan Melbourne after spending months watching their interstate mates enjoying a game via social media.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews agreed to allow some easing of restrictions anyway, which allowed hairdressers to finally re-open.Across the road, at Joey Scandizzo Salon, hairdressers were finally hard at work.In footy mad Melbourne, the Grand Final is on par with Christmas as one of the biggest social events of the year.

<div><p id="speakable-summary">The trial of Samsung leader Jay Y. Lee, who is accused of accounting fraud and stock price manipulating, held its first hearing today at the Seoul Central District Court.</p>
<p>The Seoul Central District Court denied prosecutors&#8217; arrest warrant request for Lee in June, stating that even though they had secured a &#8220;considerable amount of evidence,&#8221; it was still not enough to detain Lee.</p>
<p>Lee was not present for the hearing. Vietnamese state media reported that he was in Vietnam earlier this week to discuss investments with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that the value of electronics materials provider Cheil Industries was artificially inflated before its merger with Samsung&#8217;s holding company five years ago to create a more favorable rate for Lee, who was then Cheil&#8217;s largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Lee is also one of eleven current and former Samsung Executives <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/samsung-heir-charged-with-fraud-over-succession-linked-deal-13071626">indicted by South Korean prosecutors last month</a> over charges that they inflated the assets of Samsung BioLogics, which Cheil held a major stake in.</p>
<p>During the hearing today, Lee&#8217;s attorney said that the merger and accounting process were part of normal management activities, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/trial-begins-in-samsung-leader-jay-y-lee-s-suspected-fraud-stock-13339720">reported Channel News Asia</a>.</p>
<p>If found guilty, Lee may face a jail sentence. Lee has already spent time in jail, after he was charged with bribing former President Park Geun-hye to secure support for the merger. Lee was released from prison in 2018 after serving almost a year.</p>
<p>Park was impeached in 2017 and sentenced to a 25-year prison term for bribery, abuse of power and embezzlement.</p>

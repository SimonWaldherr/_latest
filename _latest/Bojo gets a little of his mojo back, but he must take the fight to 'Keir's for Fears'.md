Taking to his feet, the Leader of the Opposition dodged the L word carefully as he harangued the Prime Minister: “Sage gave very clear advice; they said a package of interventions including a circuit breaker will be needed to prevent an exponential rise in cases. Why did the PM reject that advice and abandon the science?”

A ‘circuit breaker’ is of course politician-speak for ‘second lockdown’; but calling it this would be to admit defeat, reminding the nation of its ineffective predecessor.

When the time comes for national lockdown number three, we can expect some exciting new electrical terminology (my money is on ‘fuse box’ or ‘reset button’).

Energised perhaps by no longer being the biggest authoritarian in the room, Boris defended his tiered restrictions with gusto.

Citing the “associated harms” of full lockdown, he concluded with Panglossian vim: "We can bring down the R, and we can bring down the virus!”

However, Mr Starmer would not be drawn. “I don’t think that approach goes far enough”, he said of his own position from two days ago, “and neither does Sage”.

But his delivery was moribund; sitting on the fence for too long can have a deadening effect on both your bottom and your performance.

As ‘Keir’s for Fears' began spouting statistics about hospitalisations, I should have been scared witless, but his colourless monotone and deadpan expression merely reminded me of Mr Carnegie, the health inspector from Fawlty Towers, who reels off every detail of Basil’s multiple contraventions of the hygiene regulations.

Instead of “dirty cracked and greasy floors” and “evidence of smoking in food preparation areas”, we had a rising R-rate and growing hospital admissions – but so great was the resemblance, I half expected him to conclude “and there are two dead pigeons in the water tank”.

Citing local leaders who favoured a national lockdown, Mr Starmer unveiled his trump card – the Conservative leader of Bolton Council – with relish. “Keep up, Prime Minister”, he smirked.

However, in his zeal to tick off his fellow jailer for the escaping inmates, he veered away from his usual forensic analysis and attention to detail. To Tory delight, the Conservative leader of Bolton Council spent the afternoon furiously demanding an apology.

Unaware that in clambering off the fence he had torn his trousers, Mr Starmer dialled up the sanctimony: “I know that for someone who’s been an opportunist all his life this is difficult to understand. But having read and considered the Sage advice, I have genuinely concluded that a circuit break is in the national interest … genuinely concluded”, he repeated for dramatic effect, though it felt more like a supply teacher haranguing a particularly dimwitted group of remedial readers.

The PM saw the opening and took it. “Opportunism is the name of the game for the party opposite!”, he roared. “[Starmer] voted to do nothing last night … nothing in the areas where the incidence is high!”

Britain is still awaiting its Scarlet Pimpernel to free the country from the constraints of lockdown – sorry circuit breaker – but the “demmed, elusive” Boris seems to have some of his mojo back.

Or perhaps it was just a reminder that things could be worse.

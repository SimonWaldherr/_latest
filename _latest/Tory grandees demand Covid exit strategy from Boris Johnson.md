Tory grandees are demanding that Boris Johnson urgently sets out an exit strategy from "a constant cycle of lockdowns", as an influential expert on public opinion warned the Prime Minister risked appearing "blasé" about the lives of ordinary people.

Senior Conservatives expressed growing anger at the Government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, amid mounting concern that swathes of the country are heading for further restrictions this week.

On Saturday, Julian Jessop, an independent economist, said that another lockdown could result in a fresh hit to GDP of at least 5 per cent.

Lord Lamont, the former Chancellor, warned that repeatedly imposing draconian restrictions and then lifting them is "deeply damaging to business and is not really a strategy".

Sir Graham Brady, Chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, whose Altrincham and Sale West constituency in Manchester faces being placed in the highest tier of restrictions, said constant lockdowns or "circuit breakers" to suppress the virus would be "pointless".

"If further restrictions on people's lives are proposed, the Government has to set a clear end date and a strategy for returning life to normal," Sir Graham said.

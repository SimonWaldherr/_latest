Andy Burnham has launched a blistering attack on the Government, accusing ministers of treating Manchester like "sacrificial lambs" and "canaries in the coalmine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy".

Local leaders had "unanimously opposed the Government's plans for tier three" which were "flawed and unfair", the Greater Manchester Mayor confirmed.

Ministers had thought a deal would be agreed this morning, allowing Matt Hancock to confirm the new restrictions to the Commons alongside those for London, Essex and many other parts of the country.

But in a passionate speech in central Manchester this afternoon, Mr Burnham laid into the Government for "treating the North with contempt", and being "willing to sacrifice jobs here to save them elsewhere" - despite Boris Johnson's repeated promises to level up the country.

"We have hit a point where... people are fed up with being treated in this way, we aren't going to be pushed around any more," he said. "This isn't a game, this is real. The North stands on the brink, back to where we were in the 1980s, where we are just pushed aside. We won't let that happen."

He added: "They are asking us to gamble our residents jobs, home and businesses, and a large chunk of the country's economy, on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work. We will never sign up to that."

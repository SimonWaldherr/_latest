<div><p>I wanted to understand the charge, so I approached Bathing Solutions and asked it for an itemised breakdown of materials and labour costs. This is a standard document for any tradesman to provide. Your relatives should have asked for this before they signed on the dotted line. Bathing Solutions refused my request.</p>
<p>It said it didn&#8217;t quote on an itemised basis but rather its pricing related to a &#8220;completed bathroom including warranty and aftercare&#8221;. It added: &#8220;Our prices reflect the bespoke nature of our offering and the quality of the products we install, together with our aftersales support service and extended warranty.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a load of old cobblers, I thought to myself. I told it straight up: to refuse to show customers a breakdown of costs is woefully untransparent, and far from the behaviour I&#8217;d expect from an ethical business. Bathing Solutions told me your relatives were &#8220;extremely&#8221; happy with their bathroom.</p>
<p>I phoned you to see how they were getting on and you told me that earlier that day your relatives had been offered &#163;1,000 in compensation, which was upped to &#163;1,500 after you got involved. This was news to me. I asked Bathing Solutions about this, as it had failed to mention it. It said the money was for the&#160;delays and had nothing to do with my involvement. It was just a coincidence that the offer came the day after I got involved.</p>

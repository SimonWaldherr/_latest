Like mother, like daughter.

Kate Moss’ only daughter Lila Grace Moss made her runway debut at Miu Miu’s spring 2021 show at Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday, strutting her stuff in three different looks.

After opening the show in a blue collared shirt, oversized blazer, embellished skirt and sparkling mules, Lila later returned in a pastel blue and yellow bow-tied babydoll dress before closing the catwalk in a bejeweled pink crop top and orange miniskirt.

“THANK YOU for allowing me to debut at the dreamiest show,” Lila wrote on Instagram post-show, thanking Miu Miu along with stylist Katie Grand, casting director Anita Bitton, hairstylist Guido Palau and makeup artist Pat McGrath for their efforts.

Kate, 46, shares Lila with Dazed magazine co-founder Jefferson Hack, and the teen seems to share her parents’ love of fashion; the mother-daughter duo have sat front row together at Dior Homme and Longchamp shows.

Lila has also posed for Miu Miu and Marc Jacobs beauty campaigns.

Kate made her own runway debut at 18 as well, hitting the catwalk for Dolce & Gabbana during Paris Fashion Week in 1992 — and while the supermodel wasn’t spotted in Miu Miu’s virtual front row on Tuesday, she previously told Megyn Kelly that she’s fully supportive of her daughter’s industry ambitions.

“It’s up to her [if she wants to model]. I am leaving it up to her,” Kate said. “I will support her, obviously. I will be her momager! She can, if she wants to. I will support her in anything she wants to do.”

Indeed, Lila is represented by the Kate Moss Agency, the modeling firm her mother founded in 2016.

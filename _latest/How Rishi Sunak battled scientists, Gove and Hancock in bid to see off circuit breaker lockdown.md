When he stood in front of the nation on Monday evening, Boris Johnson made clear his opposition to a new national lockdown plan, warning it would cause "immediate harm", and adding: "We don't want to go down that extreme route right now."

But, just 24 hours later, Mr Johnson's commitment to that pledge was being put to the test with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer openly in favour of the 'circuit breaker' national lockdown, backed by the Prime Minister's own scientific advisers.

Mr Johnson will now come under pressure from the 'doves' in his Cabinet once again to subject the nation to stricter lockdown measures. For the 'hawks' in Mr Johnson's Cabinet, it was a battle they thought they had already won.

Cabinet ministers had been discussing for three weeks the guidance from the Sage group of scientific advisers which stated that what was needed was a national lockdown of several weeks to “put the epidemic back” by at least 28 days.

<p>"We don't want to allow this president to change the subject, which is what they are always doing," Buttigieg told Wallace. "There are all kinds of interesting questions on the future of the American judiciary, but right now as we speak the pre-existing condition coverage of millions of Americans might depend on what is about to happen in the senate with regard to this justice."</p><p>"My marriage might depend on what is about to happen in the senate with regard to this justice," Buttigieg added.</p><p>In the confirmation hearing, Barrett <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amy-coney-barrett-scotus-precedents-legalizing-birth-control-lgbtq-relationships-2020-10">refused to comment on the Supreme Court's landmark rulings </a>protecting LGBTQ rights and the legalization of birth control because she "can't grade precedent."

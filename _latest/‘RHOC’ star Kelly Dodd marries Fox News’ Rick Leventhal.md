Kelly Dodd is officially a Mrs.

On Saturday, the “Real Housewives of Orange County” star, 45, married Fox News personality Rick Leventhal in Santa Rosa, California.

“I’m so excited to be Mrs. Leventhal!!” Dodd gushed on Instagram, posting a photo of the bride and groom both dressed in black.

Leventhal, who announced his engagement to Dodd last fall, also posted a black-and-white snap from the couple’s special day.

“With the incredible Mrs Kelly Leventhal #10/10/2020 #grateful #rick&kelly,” Leventhal captioned the snap.

Leventhal also shared photos leading up to the ceremony, including a close-up shot of the custom face masks adorned with “Kelly & Rick 10/10/20.”

Dodd and Leventhal started dating in August 2019. He popped the question in November, presenting the Bravo personality with a 4-carat engagement ring.

This is the third marriage for both Dodd and Leventhal.

Last month, Dodd revealed she and Leventhal obtained their marriage license.

“We got our marriage license today!!! I’m so excited to marry my ride or die @rickleventhal ❤️❤️❤️❤️10/10/20,” Dodd posted at the time.

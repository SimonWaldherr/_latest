<div><p>Yes, this is happening. Miley Cyrus is making a Metallica cover album and she herself confirmed the news in her latest interview.</p>

<p>Speaking with <i>Interview </i>magazine, the pop-star said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on a Metallica cover album and I&#8217;m here working on that. We&#8217;re so lucky to be able to continue to work on our art during all of this. At first, it felt uninspiring and now I&#8217;ve been totally ignited." While there is no confirmation on the &#8220;we&#8221; she is referring to, sources have revealed that it could be Ozzy Osbourne producer and guitarist Andrew Watt, who is also part of her own band. The former <i>Hannah Montana </i>star did not share any other details about the album including the songs that she would be covering during her conversation with fashion designer Rick Owens.</p>

<p>Cyrus is no stranger to the cult band&#8217;s music. She has previously recorded the cover for &#8216;Nothing Else Matters&#8217;.<i> </i>She was seen performing her rendition of his famous song live at the <i>Glastonbury Festival </i>back in 2019. The singer was in the news recently too, receiving praise for covering Blondie&#8217;s &#8216;Heart of Glass&#8217;.<i> </i>Cyrus performed this soundtrack at the 2020 iHeartRadio Music Festival, and also the Cranberries song &#8216;Zombie&#8217; at another event in L.A.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the star added that she takes inspiration from fellow artist Iggy Pop. "People ask me who I&#8217;ve studied for my movement on stage, and I always say Iggy Pop. I usually feel pretty bottled-up, and performing is the only time I get to be myself in my fullest form," she added.</p>

<p>Metallica, which was first formed back in 1981, is among the most famous bands of all time, having won nine Grammy awards, and consecutively breaking music charts all across the world.<b> </b>The band consists of James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo.</p>

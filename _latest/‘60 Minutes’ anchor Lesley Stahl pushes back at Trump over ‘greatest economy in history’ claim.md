<div><p>CBS News&#8217; &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; on Thursday <a href="https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1319234940249190400" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a snippet</a> of an <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/trump-tweets-pics-from-fake-lesley-stahl-60-minutes-interview/">interview with President Trump</a> that showed veteran reporter Lesley Stahl pushing back at the president&#8217;s claim that he created the &#8220;greatest economy in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the clip, Stahl asks the president about his highest domestic priority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ultimately, let me tell you, it was happening. We created the greatest economy in the history of our country. And the other side,&#8221; Trump began.</p>
<p>But Stahl cut him off.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that&#8217;s not true,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is totally true. Virtually every number was the best. We had the best economy ever. And what was happening is, things were coming together,&#8221; he continued as Stahl once again broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked you what&#8217;s the priority? Those are all the good things. What do you want to solve?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our priority is to get back to normal, to get back to where we were. To have the economy rage and be great with jobs and everybody be happy. And that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re heading,&#8221; Trump said.</p>
<p>The president on Wednesday threatened to release footage of the interview, which he called &#8220;fake and biased,&#8221; to show his side of the story before the sit-down is broadcast Sunday evening.</p>
<p>He tweeted out a series of still photographs of him and Stahl in the White House as they taped the interview on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The president reportedly stormed out of the interview after Stahl continued to pepper him with questions and interrupt him.</p>
 
<p>On Thursday morning, the commander-in-chief said again that he would be releasing the interview in full.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will soon be giving a first in television history full, unedited preview of the vicious attempted &#8216;takeout&#8217; interview of me by Lesley Stahl of @60Minutes. Watch her constant interruptions &amp; anger. Compare my full, flowing and &#8216;magnificently brilliant&#8217; answers to their &#8216;Q&#8217;s,'&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1319248527613100035?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote</a>, linking to a clip of Stahl <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/trump-tweets-video-of-mask-free-lesley-stahl-after-60-minutes-interview/">standing in the White House without a mask on</a>.</p>
<p>The &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview is part of a pre-election special that will also include interviews with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic nominee Joe Biden and running mate Sen. Kamala Harris.</p>

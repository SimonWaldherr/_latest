<p>Recorded at the musician&#8217;s home in Sussex, the album&#8217;s songs were built from live takes of McCartney singing over guitar or piano accompaniments, and were overdubbed later with his bass guitar and drum parts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was about making music for yourself rather than making music that has to do a job,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I had some stuff I&#8217;d worked on over the years but sometimes time would run out and it would be left half finished so I started thinking about what I had. Each day, I&#8217;d start recording with the instrument I wrote the song on and then gradually layer it all up. It was a lot of fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The catalyst for the new work was returning to an unreleased song he made in the 1990s with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2016/mar/09/beatles-producer-george-martin-a-life-in-pictures" class="u-underline">Beatles producer George Martin</a>, When Winter Comes, which closes the album and also inspired another track, Long Tailed Winter Bird.</p>
<p>McCartney has used hallowed equipment including his violin-shaped Hofner bass guitar, a Mellotron from Abbey Road studios used by the Beatles, a double bass that backed Elvis Presley and studio gear from Wings sessions in 1971.</p>
<p>The totally solo home-recording approach is now commonly used by musicians &#8211; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/12/my-studio-is-an-extra-limb-right-now-bedroom-pop-the-perfect-genre-for-lockdown" class="u-underline">especially during lockdown</a> &#8211; but was unusual in 1970 for the original McCartney album, which was made secretly during the Beatles&#8217; fractious last months. Containing a McCartney classic in Maybe I&#8217;m Amazed, it influenced the &#8220;lo-fi&#8221; style of indie-pop. McCartney II&#8217;s skewed electronic pop has also become a cult favourite.</p>
<p>In a new interview with Loud and Quiet magazine, McCartney says the new record focuses on &#8220;freedom and love. There&#8217;s a varied lot of feelings on it, but I didn&#8217;t set out for it to all be like, &#8216;This is how I feel at this moment.&#8217; The old themes are there, of love and optimism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Addressing rumours that, at 78, he might soon retire, he said: &#8220;Everything I do is always supposed to be my last. When I was 50 &#8211; &#8216;That&#8217;s his last tour.&#8217; And it was like, &#8216;Oh, is it? I don&#8217;t think so.&#8217; It&#8217;s the rumour mill, but that&#8217;s OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jokingly alluding to a Beatles conspiracy theory, he added: &#8220;When we did Abbey Road I was dead, so everything else is a bonus.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCartney had been booked to headline this year&#8217;s Glastonbury festival, which was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. His most recent solo album was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/paul-mccartney-egypt-station-review" class="u-underline">2018&#8217;s Egypt Station</a>.</p>

<p>McCartney and McCartney II were greeted with bafflement and derision from contemporary critics but became among their author&#8217;s most celebrated solo works, perhaps because they seem so weirdly prescient.</p>
<p>The incredulity McCartney attracted on release in 1970 is understandable: perhaps the most eagerly anticipated Beatles solo debut of all turned out to be a shambolic, primitively recorded collection of instrumentals, song fragments, experiments in what would eventually be called world music, brooding small-hours meditations on McCartney&#8217;s shaky post-Beatles mental state, off-cuts from The White Album sessions plus one unimpeachable nugget of classic McCartney songcraft, Maybe I&#8217;m Amazed. In its sound and scattershot approach, it was lo-fi decades before there was an alt-rock subgenre called &#8220;lo-fi&#8221;.</p>
 
<p>McCartney II, meanwhile, was synth-heavy and recorded as his 70s band Wings collapsed. The partly atonal Temporary Secretary would be championed by DJs 20 years after its release. Darkroom and Summer&#8217;s Day Song appear to presage 21st-century electronic bedroom pop. The wiry post-punk disco of Coming Up, meanwhile, was enough to lure John Lennon back into the studio after five years, his competitive spirit challenged. &#8220;Fuck a pig, it&#8217;s Paul,&#8221; he famously exclaimed when he first heard it, turning the radio up.</p>
<p>Both albums underlined the experimental edge that&#8217;s often obscured by McCartney&#8217;s melodic abilities, and both signalled new starts: McCartney after the Beatles and McCartney II after Wings&#8217; record-breaking success. The hope is that their successor follows in their disruptive spirit.</p>

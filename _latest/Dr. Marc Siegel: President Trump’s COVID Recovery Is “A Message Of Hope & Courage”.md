  Dr. Marc Siegel: President Trump’s COVID Recovery Is “A Message Of Hope & Courage” 
description: > 
  "It should be a message of hope and courage to the rest of the country.It's so disturbing that we can't look at the President of the United States and say he's recovered from COVID-19.With the help of new medications that we're excited about, he's recovered rapidly and is back on the beam.It's that lack of identification with courage and hope that that has caused a greater virus than COVID, which is fear.But he could be seen as a symbol of leadership to elderly people over the age of 70 to get a moderate case of COVID."

</p><p>On Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla, Jimmy speaks with Fox News Medical Correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel about his new book COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science and how Americans should be reacting to President Trump's recovery from COVID. </p>
<p>"It should be a message of hope and courage to the rest of the country. Instead, there's political divisiveness, people openly hating that he recovered. It's so disturbing that we can't look at the President of the United States and say he's recovered from COVID-19. He had a moderate case because of his age and he's overweight. With the help of new medications that we're excited about, he's recovered rapidly and is back on the beam. Why can't we cheer that regardless of what side of the aisle we're on? It's that lack of identification with courage and hope that that has caused a greater virus than COVID, which is fear. But he could be seen as a symbol of leadership to elderly people over the age of 70 to get a moderate case of COVID."</p>

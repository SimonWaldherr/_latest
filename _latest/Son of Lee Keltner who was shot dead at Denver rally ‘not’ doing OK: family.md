The son of a protester gunned down by a security guard during a Denver rally is having a hard time coping after witnessing his father’s death, the dead man’s sister told The Post Sunday.

“He was there,” Suzan Keltner said in a telephone interview. Asked if her nephew was doing okay, she said, “No, no he’s not.”

Lee Keltner, a hat-maker, and military vet, was part of a “Patriot Rally” outside the Denver Art Museum when he was shot and killed by a Pinkerton guard hired by a local TV station.

“He was my brother, my only sibling,” Suzan Keltner said. “He also served our country.”

She declined to provide more details.

“There’s going to be a lawsuit,” Suzan Keltner added. “So, I don’t know how much we can let out.”

Jay Keltner, who identified himself as one of the dead man’s two sons, changed the cover photo on his Facebook page on Sunday to an image of his father being shot.

“I can’t believe my dad’s gone,” he wrote. “This will never be right #RIP.”

It is unclear if Jay Keltner was with his father when the shooting took place.

Denver police have identified Matthew Robert Dolloff as a suspect in the case. He was arrested on first-degree murder charges and was expected in court Oct. 12.

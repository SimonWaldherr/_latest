<li>More than 22 years ago, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates squared off against the Department of Justice over issues of antitrust.</li>
<li>The case is not unlike what Google is now facing: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-google-antitrust-case-revealed-2020-10">a lawsuit form the DOJ</a> alleging Google's business deals hurt smaller competitors.</li>
<li>Back in 1998, Gates was called before the Senate Judiciary Committee to be questioned about Microsoft's dominance in the software market.&#160;Microsoft's business practices ultimately led the Department of Justice to file suit against the company.&#160;</li>
<li>A court initially ruled that Microsoft should be broken up into two separate companies, which Microsoft appealed. In the end, Microsoft settled with the US government, agreeing to change its ways.&#160;</li>
<li>But the court case had long-lasting impacts on Gates and Microsoft. It directly contributed to Gates' early retirement, and Gates has said it's the reason Microsoft's smartphone ambitions failed.&#160;</li>

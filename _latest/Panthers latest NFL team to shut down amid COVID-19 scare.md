<p>Carolina players and coaches are expected to work remotely as the positive test result is rerun.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had an unconfirmed test this morning,&#8221; Panthers chief communications officer Steven Drummond said in a statement to NFL Network. &#8220;Out of an abundance of caution, players, coaches and staff inside the red line areas will work virtually today and Tuesday. The training room remains open and we are still scheduled to operate on our regular itinerary on Wednesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, the Falcons shut down their facility after the team had positive COVID-19 test results. ESPN reported that there were four positive tests, but NFL.com said the team only confirmed one other positive from a non-player. Atlanta put defensive tackle Marlon Davidson on the reserve/COVID-19 list this past Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Titans had one positive coronavirus test turn into an outbreak of 24 total cases last week as well. Patriots quarterback Cam Newton played in his first game Sunday against the Broncos since testing positive for the virus on Oct. 2. He was activated from the COVID-19/reserve list last Wednesday.</p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">She said her suspicions would have been raised by somebody walking 'nearly to the ground' with a heavy rucksack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She later became the first member of the emergency services to arrive at the scene of the explosion after she 'overtook colleagues' as she dashed across and provided assistance to casualties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Giving evidence, her supervisor, William Drysdale, said he too had not previously witnessed anyone praying at the venue but did so on the raised mezzanine level of the City Room at about 9.40pm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Asked if he thought that was unusual at the time, he replied: 'Yes and no.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, because I had never seen it before and no, as far as I knew being a Muslim if you have not prayed you find a quiet spot and then you pray there.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Drysdale said he did not regard him as suspicious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He stated to police that the man's backpack was 'so large that it was above his head'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his statement, he went on: 'As I looked a little bit longer I saw him rocking back and forward.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I couldn't tell if he was kneeling or sitting because he was quite low behind a 3ft wall which he was behind as we were just a slight angle from him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I knew he was not standing because the wall is only very small.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manchester Magistrates' Court heard Pc Bullough, who joined BTP in July 2016, was the most experienced officer at the Arena complex after another constable with 30 years of experience was called away to deal with a burglary suspect at Piccadilly rail station.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stephen Corke said he normally would have been standing on the raised level of the foyer from about 10pm for concerts but he would have been at the opposite end to where Abedi hid for nearly an hour out of sight of CCTV cameras.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the bomb was detonated there were no uniformed officers in the foyer despite instructions that one officer should be positioned there at the end of the concert.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They had left the arena unpatrolled for 40 minutes while all took a meal break at the same time, despite instructions to stagger their breaks and finish by 9pm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PC Corke was not among them because he had decided to check on a 'vulnerable location' that was on his way from Greater Manchester Police headquarters to Victoria Station, he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The location, which he did not specify, was only on the route because a road was being dug up in Ancoats, and he only did a 'drive by' check, he added</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result the officer was at the wrong end of Deansgate, one of the main shopping streets in Manchester, when the bomb went off and he had to drive at speed down the street to the arena.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His colleague, Matthew Martin, who was the passenger in the car, said they had visited Oxford Road and Deansgate stations to 'watch a few trains go in and out.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PC Corke would normally have positioned himself on the mezzanine floor close to where Salman Abedi, the bomber, spent an hour hiding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was asked if he had seen Abedi waiting in the City Room with a rucksack on his back, whether he would have realised he was out of place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'd like to think so yes.

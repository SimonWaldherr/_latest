  US election polls tracker: Will Donald Trump or Joe Biden win the 2020 presidential race? 
description: > 
  Democratic challenger Joe Biden is currently leading Donald Trump in the national polls as the US approaches its 2020 presidential election.Currently, the 10-poll average indicates that just over half of Americans intend to back Joe Biden while Mr Trump’s support trails this by around five or six points.Americans will vote on Tuesday, November 3, in order to elect their next President, either giving Mr Trump another four years or handing over the keys to the White House to Mr Biden.Mr Trump’s age, gender and weight put him into a relatively high-risk category for the virus’s worst effects.Mr Trump triumphed in 2016 despite losing the popular vote, so it is still far too early to say who will win the White House later this year.

<div><p>Democratic challenger <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/22/joe-biden-2020-who-democratic-us-election-presidential-candidate/">Joe Biden</a> is currently leading <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/popular-donald-trump-latest-approval-ratings-polls-shows-president/">Donald Trump</a> in the national polls as the US approaches its <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/22/2020-election-us-date-when-what-swing-states-how-work-covid/">2020 presidential election</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the 10-poll average indicates that just over half of Americans intend to back Joe Biden while Mr Trump&#8217;s support trails this by around five or six points.</p>
<p>Americans will <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us-2020-election/">vote on Tuesday, November 3,</a> in order to elect their next President, either giving Mr Trump another four years or handing over the keys to the White House to&#160;Mr Biden.</p>
<p>However, on October 2, the President <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/02/president-donald-trump-tests-positive-coronavirus-election/">was taken to hospital with&#160;Covid-19</a>. Though the President now appears to have recovered, it is unclear what effect, if any, this will have on the presidential race.</p>
<p>Mr Trump&#8217;s age, gender and weight put him into a relatively high-risk category for the virus&#8217;s worst effects. His recuperation will hamper his ability to hold the mass rallies that fire up by his most loyal supporters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the first world leader to test positive for Covid-19, Boris Johnson, saw a remarkable increase in his personal approval rating during his illness. YouGov polling just after he left hospital saw his net approval as Prime Minister go from four per cent to 40 per cent, as the British public sympathised with his plight.</p>
<p>Mr Trump triumphed in 2016 despite losing the popular vote, so it is still far too early to say who will <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/01/07/introducing-us-2020-new-election-campaign-newsletter/">win the White House</a> later this year.&#160;</p>
<h3>Who is in the lead for president 2021?&#160;</h3>

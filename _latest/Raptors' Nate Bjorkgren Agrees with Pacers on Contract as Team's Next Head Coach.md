D'Antoni finished out his contract in Houston and parted ways with the team in September after the Rockets were knocked out of the playoffs by the L.A. <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a>.</p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png">Video Play Button</a><p class="atom video-indicator"><p class="text">Videos you might like </p> </p><p class="">However,&#160;Bjorkgren&#160;was given the job and will now be in charge of a team that could be in something of a transition because Oladipo is only under <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nba/indiana-pacers/victor-oladipo-13315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contract</a> through the 2020-21 season. As a result, he could be subject to trade <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2906254-why-nba-insiders-expect-victor-oladipo-to-hit-the-trade-block-this-offseason" target="_blank">discussions</a> soon.</p><p class="">Still, there is a core in place with Malcolm Brogdon, T.J. Warren, Sabonis and Myles Turner even if Oladipo is not around long term, and the Pacers are a steady franchise coming off of playoff appearances in each of the last five seasons and nine of the last 10.</p><p class="">Indiana is in a situation where a coach can step in and win right away, and that is exactly what&#160;Bjorkgren will try to do in his first head coaching job.</p><p class="">The 45-year-old began his career coaching high school in Arizona before moving on to the G League, where he served as an assistant under Raptors head coach Nick Nurse from 2007-11 and helped the Iowa Energy to the league title in 2011. He then became the head coach of the Dakota <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/washington-wizards">Wizards</a>, who later became the Santa Cruz <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/golden-state-warriors">Warriors</a>, leading the team to a Finals appearance. </p><p id="br-ad-53735041" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">After another year in the G League as the head coach of the Bakersfield Jam, Bjorkgren moved on to become an <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nba">NBA</a> assistant, first under Jeff Hornacek with the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/phoenix-suns">Phoenix Suns</a> and then moving on to rejoin Nurse in Toronto.</p><p class="">While he doesn't have any NBA head coaching experience,&#160;Bjorkgren is someone who knows what it takes to succeed in the postseason where Indiana has failed of late. He won a championship as an assistant coach with the Raptors and learned from Nurse, who is generally considered one of the best coaches in the league.</p></div>

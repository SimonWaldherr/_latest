<div><p>Barclays is ready to defy pressure to replace Jes Staley this week as it signals to the City that the controversial American is secure in his job for two more years, sources claim.</p>
<p>The lender, which is reporting its third quarter earnings on Friday, is not expected to announce any succession plans this week despite a fresh attack against the banking boss from its biggest shareholder Edward Bramson last month.&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/03/06/uk-investigates-visits-barclays-jes-staley-jeffrey-epsteins/">Regulators have been investigating</a> Mr Staley&#8217;s description of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein since early this year, prompting speculation that he <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/03/02/activist-investor-demands-immediate-departure-barclays-boss/">could step aside</a> despite many investors <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/04/25/shareholders-pledge-support-barclays-boss-staley-despite-epstein/">backing the under-fire chief</a>.</p>
<p>However, sources said he has the board&#8217;s support to stay for another two years and that during this time, his former JP Morgan colleagues CS Venkatakrishnan and Paul Compton, who were promoted to the two most senior roles in the investment bank last month, will be expected to &#8220;prove their mettle&#8221; as they battle it out for the top role.</p>
<p>Mr Bramson, who has been at loggerheads with Mr Staley since building a stake in the bank two years ago through his firm Sherborne Investors, originally called for shareholders to vote against his re-election in May, but later said they should hold off on voting to avoid creating further chaos during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Mr Epstein, who was found dead in a prison cell last August, had been an important client when Mr Staley worked at JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, he said his contact with Mr Epstein &#8220;tapered off&#8221; when he left the Wall Street bank in 2013 and gradually became less frequent, ending before he became chief executive of Barclays in 2015. He is reported to have taken a yacht to visit the private Carribean island of the convicted billionaire paedophile early that year.&#160;</p>

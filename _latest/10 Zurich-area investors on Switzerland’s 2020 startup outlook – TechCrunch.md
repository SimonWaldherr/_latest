<div><p id="speakable-summary">European entrepreneurs who want to launch startups could do worse than Switzerland.</p>
<p>In a report analyzing Europe&#8217;s general economic health, cost of doing business, business environment and labor force quality, analysts looked for highly educated populations, strong economies, healthy business environments and relatively low costs for conducting business. Switzerland ended up ranking third out of 31 European nations, according to <a href="https://www.nimblefins.co.uk">Nimblefins</a>. (Germany and the UK came out first and second, respectively).</p>
<p>According to official estimates, the number of new Swiss startups has skyrocketed by 700% since 1996. Zurich tends to take the lion&#8217;s share, as the city&#8217;s embrace of startups has jump-started development, although Geneva and Lausanne are also hotspots.</p>
<p>As well as traditional software engineering startups, Switzerland&#8217;s largest city boasts a startup culture that emphasizes life sciences, mechanical engineering and robotics. Compared to other European countries, Switzerland has a low regulatory burden and a well-educated, highly qualified workforce. Google&#8217;s largest R&amp;D center outside of the United States is in Zurich.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also one of the more expensive places to start a business, due to its high cost of living, salary expectations and relatively small labor market. Native startups will need 25,000 Swiss Francs to open an LLC and 50,000 more to incorporate. While they can withdraw those funds from the business the next day, local founders must still secure decent backing to even begin the work.</p>
<p>This means Switzerland has gained a reputation as a place to startup &#8212; and a place to relocate, which is something quite different. It&#8217;s one reason why the region is home to many <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank">fintech </a> businesses born elsewhere that need proximity to a large banking ecosystem, as well as the blockchain/crypto crowd, which have found a highly amenable regulatory environment in Zug, right next door to Zurich. Zurich/Zug&#8217;s &#8220;Crypto Valley&#8221; is a global blockchain hotspot and is home to, among others, the Ethereum Foundation.</p>
<p>Lawyers and accountants tend to err on the conservative side, leading to a low failure rate of businesses but less &#8220;moonshot innovation,&#8221; shall we say.</p>
<p>But in recent years, corporate docs are being drawn up in English to facilitate communication both inside Switzerland&#8217;s various language regions and foreign capital, and investment documentation is modeled after the U.S.</p>
<p>Ten years ago startups were unusual. Today, pitch competitions, incubators, accelerators, VCs and angel groups proliferate.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s Federal Commission for Technology and Innovation (KTI) supports CTI-Startup and CTI-Invest, providing startups with investment and support. Venture Kick was launched in 2007 with the vision to double the number of spin-offs from Swiss universities and draws from a jury of more than 150 leading startup experts in Switzerland. It grants up to CHF 130,000 per company. Fundraising platforms such as Investiere have boosted the angel community support of early funding rounds.</p>
<p>Swiss companies, like almost all European companies, tend to raise lower early-stage rounds than U.S. ones. A CHF 1-2 million Series A or a CHF 5 million Series B investment is common. This has meant smaller exits, and thus less development for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>These are the investors we interviewed:</p>

<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br>
Consumer-facing startups with first revenues.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br>
AirConsole &#8212; a cloud-gaming platform where you don&#8217;t need a console and can play with all your friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don&#8217;t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br>
I really wish that the business case for social and ecological startups will finally be proven (kind of like Oatly showed with the Blackstone investment). I also think that femtech is a hyped category but funding as well as renown exits are still missing.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br>
I am looking for easy, scalable solutions with a great team.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br>
I think the whole scooter/mobility space is super hyped but also super capital intensive so I think to compete in this market at this stage is hard. I also think that the whole edtech space is an important area of investment, but there are already quite a lot of players and it oftentimes requires cooperation with governments and schools, which makes it much more difficult to operate in. Lastly, I don&#8217;t get why people still start fitness startups as I feel like the market has reached its limits.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br>
Switzerland makes &#8212; maximum &#8212; half of our investments. We are also interested in Germany and Austria as well as the Nordics.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br>
Zurich and Lausanne are for sure the most exciting cities, just because they host great engineering universities. Berne is still lagging behind but I am hoping to see some more startups emerging from there, especially in the medtech industry.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br>
Overall, Switzerland is a great market for a startup to be in &#8212; although small, buying power is huge! So investors should always keep this in mind when thinking about coming to Switzerland. The startup scene is pretty small and well connected, so it helps to get access through somebody already familiar with the space. Unfortunately for us, typical B2C cases are rather scarce.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br>
I think it is hard to make any kind of predictions. But on the one hand, I could see this happening. On the other hand, I also think that the magic of cities is that there are serendipity moments where you can find your co-founder at a random networking dinner or come across an idea for a new venture while talking to a stranger. These moments will most likely be much harder to encounter now and in the next couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br>
I think travel is a big question mark still. The same goes for luxury goods, as people are more worried about the economic situation they are in. On the other hand, remote work has seen a surge in investments. Also sustainability will hopefully be put back on the agenda.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br>
Not much. I think we allocated a bit more for the existing portfolio but otherwise we continue to look at and discuss the best cases. The biggest worries are the uncertainties about [what] the future might look like and the related planning. We tell them to first and foremost secure cash flow.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing &#8220;green shoots&#8221; regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br>
Totally! Some portfolio companies have really profited from the crisis, especially our subscription-based models that offer a variety of different options to spend time at home. The challenge now is to keep up the momentum after the lockdown.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br>
What gives me hope is to see that people find ways to still work together &#8212; the amount of online events, office hours, etc. is incredible. I see the pandemic also as a big opportunity to make changes in the way we worked and the way things were without ever questioning them.</p>

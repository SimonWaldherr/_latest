Dominic West and wife Catherine FitzGerald and their note saying their marriage "is strong"

Nothing to see here.

Dominic West and wife Catherine FitzGerald insisted in a handwritten note shown to paparazzi that their marriage “is strong” — and kissed for photographers outside their family home — after pictures emerged this week of West getting cozy with actress Lily James in Rome.

“Our marriage is strong and we’re very much still together,” read the note, signed by both West and FitzGerald. “Thank you.”

Notably, “The Affair” actor wasn’t wearing his wedding ring and FitzGerald kept her left hand in her pocket. West, 50, declined to answer any questions regarding his recent Roman holiday with 31-year-old James, who is his co-star in the series “Pursuit of Love.”

West and FitzGerald have been married since 2010 and have three children together. West also shares one child with ex Polly Astor.

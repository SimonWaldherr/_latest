The paper has been closely read by modelling teams that contribute to Sage. It may also underpin the advice given by Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, when on Monday he urged us to be aware of the “duration of time” we spend with others, and also the “volume” of the spaces we meet in.

Event R predicts not only that some events are much riskier than others, but that the same types of venue – pubs and restaurants, say – are hugely different in terms of risk depending on how they operate, some with an R value three times higher than others.

Event-specific response

The formula also shows that the measures we use to protect ourselves, such as masks, handwashing, social distancing etc., are event-specific.

For example, masks and hand hygiene are found to have a substantial impact during a short train or bus ride, but in spaces where people linger (offices, schools, restaurants) physical distancing and social bubbles are much more effective by comparison.

The reason some bars and restaurants are more risky than others is because the protection that works best in them is social bubbles, but they are also the most difficult to maintain.

It is why, for example, a quiet country pub is an entirely different proposition to a busy Soho bar.

“For events where there is mixing, bubbling is an extremely powerful intervention” relative to masks or physical distancing, the paper concludes.

Of all the variables fed into the model, time emerges as perhaps the single most important risk people underestimate.

We think of 15 minutes (the measure used by NHS test and Trace to determine a significant exposure) to be the cut-off, but the Event R model suggests the risk of infection increases steeply for hours, every extra minute making a difference.

Time indoors

It is almost certainly this factor, among others, that explains the 10pm closing time for pubs, as it slashes the amount of time drinkers remain exposed and therefore the risk of getting caught in a superspreading incident.

Dr Julian Tang, consultant virologist at the Leicester Royal Infirmary and honorary associate professor at the University of Leicester, said time spent in mixed indoor spaces was critical.

Imagine you're in a pub and someone is smoking, he said. After five minutes there would be no detectable odor left on your clothes, and after 30 minutes only a whiff. But after an hour or two you would probably have to wash your clothes to get rid of the smell.

“If an infected individual is breathing or talking, they're spreading the virus and it starts to fill up the air, just like cigarette smoke,” said Dr Tang. “The longer you stay in an area with potential transmission, the more likely you are to be infected.”

Moreover, the longer you are exposed, the greater the potential infectious dose or viral load.

Adam Kucharski, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who specialises in modelling the spread of pathogens, said Event R provided a “nice theoretical outline” for transmission of the virus.

“It's important to consider all the dimensions of transmission: who you meet with, where you meet them, what precautions you take, how long the gathering is,” he advised.

“We see a lot of superspreading events that occur during prolonged indoor gatherings, but there's not a simple distance or duration that separates gatherings into 'safe' or 'not safe'. We should aim to make things ‘safer’, and realise this means balancing a number of factors”.

Can we learn from Japan's three Cs?

Prof Kucharski said Japan’s three Cs – closed spaces, crowded places and close contact settings – provided a good rough guide to judge the likelihood of super spreader events, the risk being highest when the Cs overlap and the length of exposure increases.

He added that he personally had been thinking more about how his friends "link together", as well as trying to reduce the risk when meeting up.

"Meeting the same couple of friends regularly is obviously very different from meeting up with many people from different households", he said.

With winter approaching, Dr Tang fears Event R could rise, with superspreading events becoming more common as people are forced indoors and ventilating windows and doors are closed.

“I think the second wave will be bigger,” he said. “Testing may be better, but indoor crowding is going to be the main problem.”

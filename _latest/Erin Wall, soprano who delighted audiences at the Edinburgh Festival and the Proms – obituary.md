description: > 
  Erin Wall, who has died of breast cancer aged 44, was a Canadian-born soprano who made a great impression on British audiences; she was a finalist in the 2003 Cardiff Singer of the World competition, a moving soloist in Verdi’s Requiem on the closing night of the 2013 Edinburgh Festival, and a noble Jenifer in a Proms performance of Tippett’s The Midsummer Marriage that same year.Erin Wall’s appearance in a concert performance of Massenet’s opera Thäis at Edinburgh in 2011 was a musical revelation.Although she had the biggest part, she was the only soloist to sing from memory, communicating directly with the audience.“She also uncorked a voice in its prime: luscious pianissimos, but also a magnificent high D shaking all available chandeliers in the Festival Theatre,” observed one critic.

First up, Scott Nolan. </strong></p><p>The son of a naval officer, Scott Nolan served in the United States Navy for five years and is now a criminal defense attorney in Fairfax County, Virginia. He is not really a fan of Donald Trump, but, much like he did in 2016, he is casting a vote for Trump as a protest against the direction he believes the country is going in.</p><p><strong>Why does this election matter to you?</strong></p><p>I am a veteran, a husband and a father. This election means turning over to my children the same well-ordered society with respect for individual rights and freedoms which I inherited, or turning over to them the chaos and victim politics of the unreasoning mob.</p><p><strong>How does your background as a veteran influence your vote?</strong></p><p>President Trump has consistently acted to preserve and recover American jobs and prestige. He has refused to allow bad treaties to stand just because that&#8217;s easier and would make him more popular. He has insisted on respect for American rights and a recognition from our foreign partners that we do not intend to continue to support their ways of life without their full participation. This is particularly important to me as a veteran. </p><p>Moreover, Vice-President Biden seems to me to be a non-entity. He is a politician for politics&#8217;s sake, and wants to be president because that&#8217;s the job with the most prestige. So far as I can tell, his agenda is to get elected. I also very much fear that he will be little more than a figurehead for the far-left policies of his party. The age of the Democratic Party as a social conscience is over, replaced by a party that actually believes the disastrous lies of socialism.</p><p>Scott<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53444939" alt=" is a member of our US election voter panel"> is a member of our US election voter panel</a>.

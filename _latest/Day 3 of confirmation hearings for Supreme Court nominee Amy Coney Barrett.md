description: > 
  If confirmed, Barret could shift the U.S. Supreme Court to a 6-3 conservative majority; as in past days, she refrained from providing an opinion about whether she would vote to upend President Obama’s signature health law or a woman’s right to choose that was enshrined in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.

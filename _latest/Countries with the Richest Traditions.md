Just like last year, Old World front-runners Italy , Spain and Greece each scored at least 90 points on a 100-point scale. Italy produced about 6.6 billion pounds of pasta in 2016, by far more than any other country, and is home to the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa – two of the most famous structures on the globe. Spanish is the second-most widely spoken language in the world. Greece’s ancient Olympic Games have been copied for millennia. Finishing fourth is France , which annually draws about 7 million people to Paris' Eiffel Tower – the most visited monument requiring a fee in the world.

However, a country’s archaism does not necessarily dictate the world’s perception of its long-standing cultural clout . Guatemala , which formed the core of one of the earliest known civilizations, the Mayans, finished in the bottom quarter of the ranking.

As a region, Europe fares much better than others. Generally small in area and population, European nations are viewed as far more culturally accessible , pulling them up in the ranks past large nations like Russia (No. 15) and the United States (No. 18) despite contributions like Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s ballets and jazz music.

Mexico and India remain in fifth and sixth places, respectively, while Turkey moved past Portugal this year to take seventh. Thailand and Japan round out the top 10.

  British "firmness" with Brussels over Brexit is "bearing fruit" Michael Gove claimed on Monday after Michel Barnier conceded to UK conditions for restarting trade negotiations."There's been a constructive move on the part of the EU and I welcome that," Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told MPs in the Commons."The EU still needs to make a fundamental change in approach to the talks and make clear it has done so," he tweeted.Theresa May appeared to mouth "utter rubbish" as Mr Gove claimed the UK can "co-operate more effectively" in many areas over border security outside the EU than "we ever could inside".Former Prime Minister Mrs May had warned that a no deal Brexit would cost Britain access to EU criminal databases.

<div><p>British "firmness" with Brussels over Brexit is "bearing fruit" Michael Gove claimed on Monday after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/19/news-lockdown-manchester-wales-fire-break-brexit-boris-latest/">Michel Barnier conceded to UK conditions for restarting trade negotiations</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>The Government insists it will only <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/18/michael-gove-says-door-remains-ajar-post-brexit-trade-deal-eu/">return to the negotiating table</a> if Mr Barnier admits that the EU, as well as Britain, must compromise to get the deal done.&#160;</p>
<p>The EU's chief negotiator said he was ready to intensify trade talks across all subjects and on the basis of common legal texts after discussions with David Frost, the UK's top Brexit official, on Monday.</p>
<p>"There's been a constructive move on the part of the EU and I welcome that," Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told MPs in the Commons. "I prefer to look forward in optimism rather than necessarily to look back in anger."</p>
<p>Lord Frost told Mr Barnier the EU needed a "fundamental" change in approach to the negotiations after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/09/06/eu-will-have-just-38-days-strike-brexit-deal-warns-boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson's October 15 deadline for a deal</a> was missed last week. "The EU still needs to make a fundamental change in approach to the talks and make clear it has done so," he tweeted.&#160;</p>
<p>A Number 10 spokesman said there was "no basis" to resume talks until there was "an EU approach consistent with trying to find an agreement between sovereign equals and with acceptance that movement needs to come from the EU side as well as the UK."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/09/18/eu-leaders-discuss-brexit-summit-boost-trade-deal-hopes/">At their summit</a> on Thursday, EU leaders called on the UK to "move" on the major obstacles of fishing, the "level playing field" guarantees and the deal's enforcement. They called for negotiations to continue until the EU's no deal deadline of the end of October.</p>
<p>Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and other leaders said on Friday that both sides would have to compromise after Boris Johnson said Britain should "embrace" no deal after his deadline was missed.&#160;</p>
<p>"It has to be a fair agreement for both sides,&#8221; Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice-president said in London. "The European Union is ready to work until the last minute for a good agreement for both parties."</p>
<p>Hilary Benn, the Labour chairman of the Commons select committee on the future relationship with the European Union, said: "It's quite clear that negotiations are continuing, and I think the war of words now needs to stop."&#160;</p>
<p>Theresa May appeared to mouth "utter rubbish" as Mr Gove claimed the UK can "co-operate more effectively" in many areas over border security outside the EU than "we ever could inside".&#160;Former Prime Minister Mrs May had warned that a no deal Brexit would cost Britain access to EU criminal databases.&#160;</p>
<p>A senior EU diplomat described the current impasse in negotiations as "pantomime", saying: "On any rational calculus there should be a deal &#8211; but does Number 10 know what it wants or how to close Brexit out?"</p>

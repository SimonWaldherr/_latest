  China says environment still grim despite 5 years of progress 
description: > 
  Shanghai, China China's environment conditions are "grim," falling short of public expectations even after five years of efforts to improve air quality, boost clean energy and curb greenhouse gas emissions, a senior official said on Wednesday.There was still a long way to go, said Zhao Yingmin, the vice-minister of ecology and environment, even though China had met a series of targets on smog, water quality and carbon emissions over the five years from 2016."While seeing the improvements ... it should be clearly recognized that the quality of the ecological environment remains far from people's expectations for a better life," he told reporters in Beijing.China remains dependent on heavy industry and coal, and the "grim environmental trends" have not fundamentally changed, he added.Last month, President Xi Jinping set a 2060 deadline to attain "carbon neutrality," as part of China's commitments to the Paris climate change accord.

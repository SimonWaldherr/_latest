“Among those who didn’t show up in Pennsylvania, they were two-to-one Clinton supporters,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “What we’re seeing right now is not the same lack of enthusiasm.”

“Many of these so-called shy Biden voters, who haven’t been talking about it before, are also the voters, the Democratic voters, who stayed home four years ago and now regret it,” he added.

A Monmouth poll of registered voters in Pennsylvania last week showed that Mr. Trump’s lead among white voters without a college degree had fallen from 22 points in early September to just nine points this month, suggesting that Mr. Biden was cutting into a demographic that is crucial to the president’s hopes of winning re-election. Multiple recent polls have found Mr. Trump’s standing with those voters down compared with his 2016 result in Pennsylvania.

Mr. Biden has been working aggressively to engage just those voters — and to court their neighbors who feel uneasy about their past support of Mr. Trump. On Saturday, he campaigned in Erie, Pa., in a county that supported Mr. Trump after going for President Obama and Mr. Biden in 2012. On Monday he was set to visit Ohio, a state that some Democrats have spent the past four years writing off but that polls show may now be up for grabs.

And his train tour after the first debate took him through parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania that are closely associated with disillusioned Democrats and committed Trump voters.

His first stop after launching the tour in Cleveland was Alliance, Ohio, where the Republican mayor, Alan C. Andreani, described seeing “as many Biden signs as Trump signs, Biden flags with Trump flags.”

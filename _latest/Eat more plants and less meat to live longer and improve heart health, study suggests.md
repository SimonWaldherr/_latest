Sticking to an overall plant-based diet or a diet that includes more plant foods than animal foods could be associated with a 16% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and up to 25% lower risk of early death, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association this week.

The new study adds to "the substantial body of literature" suggesting that consuming a plant-based diet is associated with better heart health and lower risk of death, said Casey Rebholz, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and senior author of the study.

"Plant-based diets emphasize higher intakes of plant foods and lower intakes of animal foods. Foods derived from plants include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes," Rebholz said.

"Animal foods include meat, eggs, dairy, and fish or seafood," she said. "In this study, we did not define plant-based diets on the basis of complete exclusion of animal foods from the diet ... but rather ranked individuals according to their relative frequency of intake of these foods."

They took over the summer with their raunchy track WAP a few months back.

And Megan Thee Stallion was living it up big time at Cardi B's no holds barred Las Vegas birthday bash this weekend, from whence she posted an array of sexy and attention-getting pictures and video.

The Savage star, 25, scintillated in a sheer all-black bodysuit, with a bra and panties covering her modesty.

Guest of honor: Megan Thee Stallion was living it up big time at Cardi B's no holds barred Las Vegas birthday bash this weekend

She appeared to be in her own cordoned off area at the violet- and pink-hued soiree, dancing and striking poses for the camera with her hair done in a sleek swipe and high ponytail.

Megan wore dangly earrings and chunky gold jewelry on her wrists.

'Real mf hot girl sh*t,' she captioned the quartet of spicy images, in what was surely a nod to her 2019 hit, Hot Girl Summer.

In one image, Stallion was seen from behind, serving some over-the-shoulder drama with an intense expression.

Her nails were light pink and long, and her eye makeup was smoky to match a lined, nude matte lip.

In her Stories, the Texas-born rapper shared video with the lady of the hour herself, who looked somewhat inebriated as she carried around a bottle of alcohol while continuing to ring in her 28th year.

'Happy birthday babbbyyy @iamcardib' Megan wrote over the video, showing the pair kissing and posing for the camera while Cardi took a swig.

The Bodak Yellow songstress looked appropriately show-stopping in a metallic corset and white gown combo.

Additionally, Megan posted some showy snippets from the back of a car, in which she was seen handling a hefty amount of cold, hard cash.

Her commentary was virtually unintelligible as she was seen holding the plastic-wrapped stack of money, which she turned to the camera to show consisted exclusively of $100 bills.

The stack looked to contain at least $250K.

Stallion filmed friends fawning all over the green, and captioned the clip, 'Made it and gave my bestie some'.

Cardi's song WAP, the lead single from her upcoming second studio album and featuring vocals from Megan, dropped on August 7th of this year.

It debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and the NSFW music video for the track was at the center of the pop-culture stratosphere for weeks.

Notably, the sizzling video featured a passage with none other than reality star and beauty mogul Kylie Jenner â€“ who was also present this weekend at Cardi's Vegas bash.

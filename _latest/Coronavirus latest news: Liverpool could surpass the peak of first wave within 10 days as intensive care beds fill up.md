Liverpool could surpass the peak of its first coronavirus wave within 10 days, and its hospital’s intensive care beds are already at 90 per cent capacity, according to a council leader.

Paul Brant, cabinet member for adult health and social care at Liverpool City Council, said: "Our intensive, critical care beds are filling up very fast.

"The most recent figures I've seen suggest they are over 90 per cent full and our acute hospital trusts have occupancy levels of Covid-positive patients of over 250.

"At the current rate of increase, we would expect Liverpool to surpass the peak of the first wave probably within the next seven to 10 days. It has become clear that the intensity of the demand on hospital services here in Liverpool is crowding out anything other than dealing with Covid."

Elsewhere, a Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be only 50 per cent effective, the chairman of the UK Vaccine Taskforce has said.

Kate Bingham said any vaccine capable of immunising against the virus would probably be as effective as the flu vaccine.

“The vaccines we have for flu are about 50 per cent effective,” she said.

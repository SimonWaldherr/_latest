Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on Tuesday vowed that if confirmed she will not be “used as a pawn” to help decide any potential cases that arise over the results of the election.

Barrett made the remarks during the often-heated second day of confirmation hearings where Democrats grilled her about a possible disputed-election fight.

Without committing to a recusal if such cases arise involving President Trump, the 48-year-old appellate court judge said, “I do assure you of my integrity, and I do assure you that I would take that question very seriously.”

Barret said that before a decision on a recusal would be made, she would first need to consult other justices.

“I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people,” she told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Barrett testified she has not spoken to Trump or his team about election cases.

Trump announced Barrett as his Supreme Court nominee on Sept. 26 and pressed to have her confirmed before the Nov. 3 election.

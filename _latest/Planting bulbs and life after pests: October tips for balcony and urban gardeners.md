Been a bit of a damp squib, October. Seemingly relentless rain marking a premature end to many of late summer’s offerings, among them my white window box cosmos, which started the month off quite blowsy and bright and is now something of a straggle; I'll pull it out soon enough, to make room for something else.

Among these downpours, there have been other small upsets on the balcony; namely, vine weevil. It was not my first experience of the notoriously container-prone pest, but arguably the most devastating: half a dozen once-prideful heucheras and tiarellas savaged from the roots up.

Vine weevil are pernicious beasts, the kind of pest that casts a pall just by mentioning its name. I may have cursed this column simply by mentioning them. They’re nasty little bugs – in the summer the adults (beetle-like, near-impossible to spot in daylight as they lurk undercover until nightfall) leave cartoonish munch-like cuts in leaf edges. Worse is yet to come: the white grub offspring that devour roots, annihilating the plant.

In the past I’ve treated them with nematodes, dissolved in water and applied to damp soil in the height of summer. But while I’d clocked a few foliage nibbles earlier this year, I was, frankly, idle and turned a bit of a blind eye. I shan’t again.

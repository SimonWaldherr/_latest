Leaders in the north of England have criticised plans to close pubs and hospitality venues as part of a new system of coronavirus restrictions.

Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, will hold a snap press conference at 12.30pm alongside other northern leaders in response to the Government's latest lockdown plans.

Meanwhile, the leader of Gateshead Council, Martin Gannon, said this morning that he is opposed to a lockdown of hospitality venues and that current measures should be given time to work.

Mr Gannon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I think new measures would be counter-productive.

"We had three different sets of regulations in 10 days which caused huge resistance and confusion.

"Our argument is that even with the mixed messaging, even with the confusion and frustration, the measures that are in at the moment are beginning to work."

Similarly, Liverpool's mayor Joe Anderson complained that local leaders aren't being consulted by the Government on new measures. "The main point of the imposition of the measures are clearly that: imposition. We have not be consulted," he said.

It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to outline a new three-tiered system of restrictions on Monday with measures expected to see pubs and restaurants to shut across the north of England.

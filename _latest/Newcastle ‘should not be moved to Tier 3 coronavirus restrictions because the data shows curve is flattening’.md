The Leaders of all seven councils in Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and County Durham, along with the North of Tyne Mayor and the Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner, issued a joint statement.

“At every turn we have put any differences aside to work together for the benefit of our residents, businesses and communities,” they said.

“We took the decision early last month to approach the government to ask for restrictions and resources to be put in place due to a worrying rise in the community Covid infection rate.

“While we welcomed the government’s response, the package of measures we put forward to support this move was not delivered.

“Three weeks on, and there is evidence that the restrictions are starting to have an impact. Figures are moving in the right direction, with the rise in cases slowing and giving us cause for cautious optimism.

“We are concerned by the suggestion that a decision could be taken nationally to move our region into Alert Level 3, and we strongly oppose this at the current time.

“We are seeing evidence of a flattening of the curve and there is a collective view – shared by all the leaders, Chief Executives and critically our superb Directors of Public Health that, with the public’s support we can make Alert Level 2 work.

“Our thanks to everyone who has done their bit so far, if we are to beat COVID-19 and protect our most vulnerable residents, we need everybody to follow the restrictions in place, avoid gatherings and mixing indoors with other households, and maintain the 'Hands, Face, Space' public health guidance at all times.

“We are committed to working with the government, but it needs to be a genuine collaboration, based on the data, rather than restrictions imposed upon us. We would welcome an urgent response to our proposals to support residents, communities, businesses and public services through the challenging winter months ahead.

“We firmly believe now is not the time to be moving to Alert Level 3, the evidence does not support this, and the economic consequences will be devastating without further support.”

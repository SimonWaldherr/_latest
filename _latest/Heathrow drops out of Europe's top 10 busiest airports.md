Heathrow has dropped out of Europe’s top ten busiest airports, new research shows, after the airport saw just 18 per cent of the usual number of passengers in August compared to 2019.

This August around 40,000 passengers per day passed through Heathrow - which formally sat at the top of the rankings - compared with a daily average of 220,000 pre-Covid. The analysis was published by Ralph Anker for the Anker Report.

Moving down from 1st to 11th in the league, Heathrow has been overtaken by four Russian and three Turkish airports, as well as Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris Charles de Gaulle.

Moscow Domodedovo made the top spot, while the Russian capital’s second airport, Sheremetyevo, came a close second. The third Moscow airport, Vnokovo, also made the top 10, as did St Petersburg’s Pulkovo.

Why the prevalence of Russian airports? “Russian domestic air travel was almost at 2019 levels in August, thanks to locals taking their summer holidays at resort destinations within Russia on the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Caspian Sea,” said Anker.

Turkey too, has seen strong domestic travel – both Istanbul airports made the top ten. The country also benefited over the summer from British tourists who until recently could go on holiday there without needing to quarantine upon their return.

Turkey is among the latest countries to be removed from the UK’s travel corridors list, and with few left on the FCDO’s ‘safe’ list (Italy and Germany among them), Heathrow's low numbers won't be rising any time soon.

“Governments across Europe and around the world appear to be doing their level best to kill off the demand for air travel by introducing ever more quarantine requirements or even just complete travel bans,” added Anker.

It’s hoped testing – expected to start trials in Heathrow soon – may help turn things around for the travel industry. Under a proposed ‘test and trace’ system, those testing negative for the virus would only need to quarantine for five days upon their return to the UK.

John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow’s chief executive, who supports The Telegraph's Test4Travel campaign, has said the UK aviation industry needs action from the Government, stating that “testing is the lifeline that the UK’s aviation sector needs to get back on its feet.”

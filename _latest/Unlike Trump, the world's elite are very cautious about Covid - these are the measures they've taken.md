While Donald Trump may be dominating the news agenda with his assertion that Covid-19 is nothing to ‘be afraid of’ - despite tens of people falling ill in the White House and his own hospitalisation - other powerful people, it seems, don’t believe his hype.

Over in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin, 67, has been taking the virus very seriously indeed despite urging his countrymen to get back to life as normal. He has not travelled since January 2020 and, reportedly, will not be doing so until after he’s received a Covid-19 vaccine - which he has not done yet, unlike one of his two adult daughters who took part in a vaccine trial as a volunteer. "Thank God, my daughter is feeling well," the president said.

Reports claim that the Russian politician has only been holding very limited meetings with others since March (briefings with senior officials are held by video link) and even then, anyone meeting Putin must quarantine for a minimum of two weeks beforehand and have a negative Coronavirus test.

Russian investigative news outlet Proekt claims that two large health resorts in the seaside town of Sochi have been set aside for people quarantining before visiting the president – last month they reportedly housed 30 nuclear industry workers before they visited the Kremlin.

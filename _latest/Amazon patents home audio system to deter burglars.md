  Amazon patents home audio system to deter burglars 
description: > 
  Amazon has patented a system which would record the sounds of your home through your Echo smart speakers and then play them back to deter burglars.Amazon explains in its patent filing that Echo smart speakers in a customer’s home could regularly make recordings of everyday life and then store them for future use.If the street is too loud and burglars might miss the sounds being played inside then the Echo speakers would automatically raise their volume.The system described in Amazon’s patent filing was designed by Jamie Siminoff, the chief executive of smart doorbell business Ring which Amazon acquired in 2018.It’s an expansion on an existing Amazon service, known as Alexa Guard, which is designed to deter and detect burglars.

<div><p>Amazon has patented a system which would record the sounds of your home <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/30/lawyers-urged-switch-alexa-working-home/">through your Echo smart speakers</a> and then play them back to deter burglars.</p>
<p>Amazon explains in its patent filing that Echo smart speakers in a customer&#8217;s home could regularly make recordings of everyday life and then store them for future use.</p>
<p>If a&#160;camera or a smart doorbell detects any unusual activity outside the house when the customer isn&#8217;t home, the Echo speakers throughout the house are&#160; activated to play sounds which simulate everyday life.</p>
<p>The patent also suggests that microphones could be used to check the volume outside the house. If the street is too loud and burglars might miss the sounds being played inside then the Echo speakers would automatically raise their volume.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s patent filing suggests the company may wish to develop the system for release. However, many large technology companies file thousands of patents with no intention of ever releasing the things described within them.</p>
<p>The system described in Amazon&#8217;s patent filing was designed by Jamie Siminoff, the chief executive of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/01/09/amazons-ring-fires-four-employees-snooping-customer-video-feeds/">smart doorbell business Ring</a> which Amazon acquired in 2018.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/09/20/amazon-alexa-learns-thwart-burglars-detecting-home-intrusions/">expansion on an existing Amazon service</a>, known as Alexa Guard, which is designed to deter and detect burglars.&#160;</p>
<p>The current system, available on Echo speakers, listens for suspicious noises such as the sound of breaking glass and sends alerts to customers to inform them of a potential break-in.</p>
<p>When turned on, the Alexa Guard system can also integrate with smart lights in the home to automatically turn them on and off to make it appear as if someone is home.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s home security patents filed in recent years have revealed that the company has a keen interest in protecting the homes of customers.</p>
<p>In 2018, the business filed a patent which would have used footage gathered by smart doorbells to compile a database of potentially suspicious people which could be shared between customers.</p>
<p>The database described in the patent could also be expanded to include sex offenders and other criminals. Privacy experts warned that a database of suspicious people could be a step too far, with a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union calling it a &#8220;disturbing vision of surveillance in the future.&#8221;</p>

<div><p>ABU DHABI &#8211; UFC heavyweight <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/alexander-volkov">Alexander Volkov</a> took a step in the wrong direction against Curtis Blaydes, but it hasn&#8217;t derailed his championship aspirations.</p>
<p>Ahead of his UFC 254 bout against Walt Harris on Saturday, Volkov (31-8 MMA, 5-2 UFC) reflected on the unanimous decision defeat he suffered in June.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that I made a little step back,&#8221; Volkov told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at a pre-fight news conference Tuesday. &#8220;Every loss makes you step back. We have a lot of examples of fighters who lose their fights and then come back and become a champion. For me, that&#8217;s just experience. Since I didn&#8217;t lose like a fool, I made a lot of damage in that fight. After the fight, I was fresh. The next day after the fight, I ran about six miles really easily. I had no damage, no injuries, nothing. For sure, I&#8217;m going for the belt, but for now, to be honest for myself, I need to take some wins to prove to everybody that I&#8217;m ready for this.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Harris (23-8 MMA, 6-7 UFC) is coming off of a loss of his own. Despite being ahead of Harris in the official UFC rankings, Volkov said he accepted the fight because of his opponent&#8217;s &#8220;big name,&#8221; given the options available.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of those guys who are free right now,&#8221; Volkov said. &#8220;Also, he&#8217;s a big name &#8211; a big guy. He has really good striking skills. I think it will be a really nice fight with him. It&#8217;s a good fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>UFC 254 takes place Saturday at Flash Forum on Yas Island, Abu Dhabi. The main card streams on pay-per-view after prelims on ESPN 2/ESPN+.</p>

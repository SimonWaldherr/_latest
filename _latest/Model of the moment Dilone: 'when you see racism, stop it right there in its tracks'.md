Like many of her top-model peers, Janiece Altagracia Dilone goes by only one name - her last, pronounced dill-own. She has just finished a yoga session, "and I'm kind of buzzing," she says, laughing, via Zoom, from the London hotel where she is quarantining.

Even before Covid grounded the international fashion merry-go-round, the 26-year-old New Yorker had stepped back from a career that saw her walk for the most coveted brands, including Versace, Fendi, Oscar de la Renta and Balmain, and star on the cover of Vogue, Elle, I-D and L'Officiel.

"There's a taboo with taking a break, but I really needed it. And now being back at work, I have an immense amount of gratitude," she says. "I used to find fashion to be a little shallow, but I've learnt that you can spiritualise anything." This she does with daily yoga, meditation and keeping a journal. "It seems to be working," she notes. "I don't like thinking about the future too much - it gives me anxiety."

Dilone spent the first month of lockdown in Los Angeles, having been stranded there mid-shoot. "I was cruising around and going on hikes. It was so dead, and it was really beautiful to see LA like that," she says. The rest of the time she spent with her large family - her mother, nine siblings and various nieces and nephews - in Long Island, where she was born and raised.

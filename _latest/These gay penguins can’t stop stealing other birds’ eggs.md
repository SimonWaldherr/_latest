<div><p>Kidnappy feet.</p>
<p>Fresh off their botched theft of a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/gay-penguins-try-to-hatch-egg-after-swiping-it-from-straight-couple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heterosexual penguin couple&#8217;s eggs</a>, opportunistic gay penguins in the Netherlands have now turned to snatching the potential offspring of lesbian birds.</p>
<p>This time, the expectant fathers &#8212; who reside at Amersfoort&#8217;s DierenPark &#8212; made off with the lesbian lovebirds&#8217; entire nest, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8862565/Gay-male-penguins-steal-lesbian-penguins-eggs-Dutch-zoo-latest-bid-fathers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Daily Mail reported.</a> They are currently taking turns baby-sitting their quarry while the other hunts for food.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely the baby-snatchers&#8217; eggs will hatch, as they were stolen from female penguins and will not be fertilized. Last year, their attempt to steal a straight penguin couple&#8217;s eggs similarly backfired after their egg didn&#8217;t produce a chick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Homosexuality is fairly common in penguins, but what makes this couple remarkable is that they have gotten hold of an egg,&#8221; said zookeeper Marc Belt at the time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the lady birds don&#8217;t seem too perturbed by the nest robbery, and will likely build a replacement soon as the species breeds twice per year, according to keepers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that egg won&#8217;t also be pilfered by their male counterparts, who are the dominant pair out of the enclosure&#8217;s 17 penguins. &#8220;Each couple in the enclosure have their own shelter but this couple has commandeered two,&#8221; said zookeeper Sander Drost.</p>
<p>The penguins aren&#8217;t the first same-sex soulmates to hatch an unauthorized adoption scheme. A same-sex duo in Denmark <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/27/zookeeper-says-gay-penguins-snatched-baby-from-negligent-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made online waves in 2018</a> after &#8220;kidnapping&#8221; a chick while its parents were having a swim. And in August, a lesbian power couple in Valencia, Spain, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/20/lesbian-penguins-become-proud-moms-after-adopting-an-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">successfully incubated and birthed a baby bird</a> a la Dr. Seuss&#8217; &#8220;Horton Hatches the Egg.&#8221;</p>

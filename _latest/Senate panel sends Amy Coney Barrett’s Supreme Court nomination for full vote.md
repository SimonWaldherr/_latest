<div><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-0 to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. The nomination will now move to a full Senate vote on Monday.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham on Thursday said he will not allow Democrats to &#8220;take over&#8221; the Senate Judiciary Committee&#8217;s confirmation vote on Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett after they made good on their <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/22/dems-to-boycott-scotus-hearing-in-effort-to-block-nomination/">threat to boycott the hearing</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to allow them to take over the committee,&#8221; Graham said in his opening statement. &#8220;They made a choice not to participate after allowing judge Barrett four days to be questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that members of his party would not take part in the confirmation vote because of how Republicans handled her nomination.</p>
<p>He called it &#8220;the most rushed, most partisan and least legitimate process in Supreme Court nomination history.</p>
<p>The New York Democrat added that the Democrats would &#8220;not provide the quorum that is required,&#8221; referencing a Senate rule requiring members of the opposite party to be present to conduct government business.</p>

  Supreme Court will rule on Trump administration policy forcing asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON â€“ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide the fate of a Trump administration policy that forces migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico while their applications are pending.The so-called Migrant Protection Protocols represent one of several administration efforts to reduce the number of asylum-seekers entering the country.Under the policy, asylum-seekers may come back to the United States only to appear for their court hearings.Immigration officials are instructed not to ask asylum-seekers whether they fear returning to Mexico.The Supreme Court likely will hear the case early next year and decide the policy's fate by June.

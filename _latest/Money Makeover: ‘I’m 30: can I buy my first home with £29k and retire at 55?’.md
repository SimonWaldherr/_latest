  Money Makeover: ‘I’m 30: can I buy my first home with £29k and retire at 55?’ 
description: > 
  Vinnie Moyo is looking to buy his first home with a deposit of £29,000.“I’m not sure whether to buy in London, where I work, as I’m likely to move to Manchester in the next five years to be closer to my family,” Mr Moyo said.I could rent a home for a lower cost in Greater Manchester and let out the London property.This will make it very difficult for Mr Moyo to buy a £340,000 home with his £29,000 deposit, which is less than 10pc of the value.Unlike with Help to Buy loans or most shared-ownership homes, a property bought using a Lifetime Isa can be let out later on.

<div><p>Vinnie Moyo is looking to buy his first home with a deposit of &#163;29,000. The 30-year-old, who works in accountancy, holds &#163;25,000 of this as cash in a<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/lifetime-isa-do-open-one/"> Lifetime Isa</a>, which includes a 25pc top up from the Government and can be used to purchase a first property.</p>
<p>The remaining &#163;4,000 is in a current account that earns no interest. He is looking at homes that cost about &#163;340,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure whether to buy in London, where I work, as I&#8217;m likely to move to Manchester in the next five years to be closer to my family,&#8221; Mr Moyo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am veering towards Stratford or Brixton in London, as they would make a good long-term investment. I could rent a home for a lower cost in Greater Manchester and let out the London property. But would this break the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/lifetime-isa-do-open-one/"> rules of the Lifetime Isa?</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Moyo&#8217;s second goal is to build up enough pension savings to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pensions-retirement/tax-retirement/retiring-55-make-money-last-30-years-paying-little-tax-possible/">retire in his mid-50s</a>. He recently changed jobs and has around &#163;47,000 across two workplace pensions with former employers. Combined, he and his new employer are contributing &#163;550 a month into his pot. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether to consolidate the two old pensions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He manages to save about &#163;1,000 a month, &#163;320 of which goes into a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/millennial-investorcan-stock-market-buy-house-within-10-years/">stocks and shares Isa</a> with Moneyfarm, which offers ready-made investment portfolios.</p>
<p>In total he has about &#163;6,000 in the firm&#8217;s second most risky portfolio. He has no debts apart from a student loan.</p>
<h3>Aneisha Beveridge of&#160;Hamptons International, an estate agent, said:</h3>
<p>In recent months lenders <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/personal-banking/mortgages/mortgage-availability-falls-10-year-low-half-loans-pulled-market/">have withdrawn a large number of mortgages</a> for people with small deposits. This will make it very difficult for Mr Moyo to buy a &#163;340,000 home with his &#163;29,000 deposit, which is less than 10pc of the value.</p>
<p>While there are still options out there, some banks will only lend on a house rather than a flat.</p>
<p>In Brixton and Stratford average prices for a house passed &#163;900,000 this year. A budget of &#163;340,000 means Mr Moyo should be looking for a flat instead, although he may have to look elsewhere, as prices of apartments in these areas are above his budget too.</p>
<p>Unlike with Help to Buy loans or most shared-ownership homes, a property bought using a Lifetime Isa can be let out later on. But this is on the proviso that the decision was driven by a change in circumstances and the property was not bought specifically to be let out.</p>

It was originally pitched to the Army as the UH-1G, basically a "tweaked" utility helicopter.</p><p>While anyone with eyes could easily see the design was something new, Bell had just lost an attack helicopter competition to Lockheed, and a brand-new attack helicopter would've required another competition, delaying the weapon's debut and potentially setting up the craft for a loss to another manufacturer.</p><p>So Bell played fast and loose with the rules and the Army played along.</p>

(CNN) Megan Thee Stallion makes her living having a way with words and she's got some strong ones in a New York Times opinion piece published Tuesday.

Headlined "Megan Thee Stallion: Why I Speak Up for Black Women" it lays out the rapper's thoughts on everything from her own recent troubles to how she controls her image and the legacy of Black female elected officials, including Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

She begins her column noting that "In the weeks leading up to the election, Black women are expected once again to deliver victory for Democratic candidates."

"Despite this and despite the way so many have embraced messages about racial justice this year, Black women are still constantly disrespected and disregarded in so many areas of life."

She goes on to reference two incidents that have had her in the headlines: Her recent performance on "Saturday Night Live" and her alleged wounding at the hands of former friend, singer Tory Lanez.

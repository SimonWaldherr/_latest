President Donald Trump raised nearly $248 million in September, his campaign has announced – a total that ranks among the most successful months in presidential election fundraising history but still lags far behind the record-breaking performance of his opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden .

Trump communications director Tim Murtaugh announced the haul on Twitter late Thursday night – about 24 hours after Biden said he raised $383 million in September, breaking the fundraising record for the second consecutive month. Biden's September and August performances sit atop the record books for monthly fundraising in presidential general elections, according to data compiled by the Campaign Finance Institute , a division of the National Institute on Money in Politics. Trump now has the third- and fourth-most money raised in a month, including the $210 million he collected in August .

"President Trump hits final stretch with strength, resources, record & huge ground game needed to spread message and secure re-election," Murtaugh said on Twitter.

But the numbers show that Biden might have more resources – at least financially – than Trump with less than three weeks until Election Day. The Trump campaign has just over $251 million in cash on hand, according to Murtaugh. Biden, on the other hand, has $432 million in the bank after September, campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said on Wednesday. Trump long held a big cash advantage over the former vice president, but that changed in August .

"The campaign will have the ability to spend when and where they want, likely avoiding having to make tough decisions about allocating resources in the homestretch," said Brendan Glavin, a senior data analyst at the Campaign Finance Institute, in an email to U.S. News.

Biden is using these growing resources to dominate the television airwaves, according to a report released Thursday by the Wesleyan Media Project , in conjunction with the Center for Responsive Politics. Their analysis shows that in the past two weeks, Biden's campaign has spent $56 million on a whopping 80,000 television ad airings, while the Trump campaign has spent $32 million on 32,000 airings.

"Although the impact of ads in presidential races tends to be fairly small, Biden's consistent ad advantages of two-to-one or even three-to-one in the battleground states has to account for at least some of his expanding lead in the polls over the past few weeks," said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, in a statement.

The Republican Party, nevertheless, has strong fundraising resources behind Trump. The president tweeted on Tuesday that WinRed, the conservative online donations platform, had raised more than $1 billion since its founding in 2019 . Trump has also said that he would self-fund his campaign if necessary.

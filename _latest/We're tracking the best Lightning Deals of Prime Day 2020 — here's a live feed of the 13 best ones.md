Lightning Deals are Amazon's fast-moving, limited-time, and limited-stock deals throughout Prime Day. They're aptly named — some of them are only available with limited stock, and many of the best Lightning Deals sell out well before their timer expires. You can add yourself to the waitlist in case more items become available â€" we've seen it happen. For example, just this morning, we watched a Lightning Deal on a Coop Original Pillow sell out within 10 minutes of going live. But later in the day, they released more stock.

That's why we're staying on top of the best Lightning Deals so you don't have to wade through 200 pages of deals to find that hidden gem. We'll be updating this article throughout Prime Day, so keep checking back. And don't be discouraged if you miss out on a Lightning Deal. A new one is coming up ... now.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Ms. Al Haidari&#8217;s hopes for her family&#8217;s reunion dimmed further last month when Mr. Trump told Congress <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/politics/trump-refugees.html" title="">he planned to cut the cap on refugees</a> for a fourth straight year. The number of refugees admitted depends on the administration and world events, but the ceiling for the current fiscal year, 15,000, is the lowest in the program&#8217;s four decade-long history. During the Obama administration, the cap was at least 70,000 a year. The announcement came as Mr. Trump fell back on the kind of anti-immigration messaging that has been a staple of his campaigns, tarring refugees as threats to public safety and the economy, despite <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/refugees-revenue-cost-report-trump.html" title="">multiple studies debunking such generalizations</a>. He also used the issue to attack his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/joe-biden-immigration.html" title="">proposed raising refugee admissions</a> to 125,000.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But families like the Al Haidaris make for unlikely political targets. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-muslims-military.html" title="">Veterans and active-duty service members</a> fear that the exclusion of those who assisted the military from resettlement is the real threat to national security because such cooperation will be harder to come by in future conflicts. More than 9,800 Iraqis were welcomed to the United States in 2016, according to State Department data. By the 2019 fiscal year, that was down to 465.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;If the message is sent that those who stepped up to help American service members were left behind, forgotten, and to die, then it&#8217;s going to significantly reduce the likelihood of people stepping forward in the future in other countries to help U.S. service members with their missions,&#8221; said Allen Vaught, a former captain in the Army who served in Iraq from 2003 to 2004.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Vaught has helped two Iraqis and their families resettle in Texas, his home state, where he served in the Legislature from 2007 to 2011. Two other translators who helped his squad were executed, Mr. Vaught said. He has spent years lobbying for the approval of a fifth who fled to Egypt in 2014 to escape retaliation from Iraqi militia groups. At least 110,000 Iraqis are waiting to be approved as refugees based on their assistance to the American authorities, according to resettlement organizations.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Anyone who worked with U.S. forces had a scarlet letter,&#8221; Mr. Vaught said. &#8220;They had a mark on their head. And the way they killed them was gruesome. One of my translators was burned alive.&#8221;</p></div>

  The heavy-duty Army howitzer you've probably never heard of 
description: > 
  The M107 self-propelled howitzer, a 175 mm artillery piece, entered service in 1962 and could hurl shells up to 25 miles.But the M107 didn't have a long service life, and the powerful weapon has mostly faded from memory.One such artillery piece is the M107 self-propelled howitzer.This 175 mm artillery piece entered service in 1962, alongside the M110, an 8-inch self-propelled howitzer.The M107 is not like the M109 self-propelled howitzer in that it is open and lacks both a turret and on-board ammunition storage.

<p>Some artillery pieces become very famous. Some of the most notable are the French 75 of World War I, or the <a href="http://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/this-is-how-to-fire-a-civil-war-cannon-step-by-step">Napoleons</a> used during the Civil War, or the <a href="http://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/you-can-see-the-most-notorious-german-artillery-piece-be-fired">German 88</a>. But some are less well-known, but packed a big punch &#8211; or long range &#8211; of their own.</p><p>One such artillery piece is the <a href="https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=757">M107 self-propelled howitzer</a>. This 175 mm artillery piece entered service in 1962, alongside the <a href="https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=59">M110</a>, an 8-inch self-propelled howitzer. It could fire shells as far as 25 miles away &#8211; and this long range proved very handy during the Vietnam War.</p><p>The M107 is not like the M109 self-propelled howitzer in that it is open and lacks both a turret and on-board ammunition storage. As such, it needed its ammo vehicles nearby to provide shells. The M107 was fast for an armored vehicle, with a top speed of 50 mph, and could go almost 450 miles on a single tank of fuel.</p><p>

</p><p>The M107s used the same chassis as the M110s. In fact, Olive-Drab.com reported that the two self-propelled howitzers could exchange guns, thus a M107 could become a M110, and vice versa. This was used to good effect in Vietnam, where the barrels could be swapped as needed at firebases.</p>

<p>Israel also used the M017 for decisive effect in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, destroying a number of Syrian and Egyptian surface-to-air missile batteries and even <a href="http://www.military-today.com/artillery/m107.htm">shelling Damascus</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/175.htm">According to GlobalSecurity.org</a>, the M107 fired only one type of conventional round, the M347 high-explosive round. The gun didn't see service long past the Vietnam War.</p><p>The M107 had a long reach, but it was not accurate &#8212; rounds like the laser-guided Copperhead or the GPS-guided Excalibur had not been developed yet.</p><p>An extended barrel for the M110 was developed, and in the late 1970s many M107s were converted to the M110A2 standard. The M110s eventually were replaced by the M207 MLRS.</p>

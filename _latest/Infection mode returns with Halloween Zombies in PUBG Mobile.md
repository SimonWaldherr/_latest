<p>In the infection mode, players are split into two teams at the beginning of the match, including Zombies and Defenders. Zombies must defeat all Defenders before the time limit ends the match for victory, but if even one Defender survives, the Defender team earns the Chicken Dinner. While Defenders boast firearms of M416 and AK47 with super Extended Mags, Zombies can only use melee attacks and abilities, which have cool-down times.</p>

<p>Once defeated, Defenders will become infected and respawn as Zombies, who can even transform into Fast Zombie, Stealth Zombie, and the Zombie King with huge defense and attack boost. Defenders will also transform into powerful combatants called the Vanquisher when there are only three of them left. Infected killed by Vanquishers cannot be resurrected. These make the game play even more interesting and encourage strategy from different side.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is a themed in d&#233;cor for Halloween. Zombies wear Halloween masks, with new atmospheric decorations, including jack-o'-lanterns, gravestones and candles.</p>

<div><p>The NYPD plans to send &#8220;more police officers&#8221; to polling places across Gotham this year because of the &#8220;contentious&#8221; 2020 presidential election &#8212; and will have additional teams of cops ready to respond to trouble, officials announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, we have no known threats or disruptions and we do not expect any during the course of the next few weeks,&#8221; Chief of Department Terence Monahan said at a press conference at One Police Plaza.</p>
<p>&#8220;But let me be clear, the NYPD is fully prepared to protect every person&#8217;s right to vote. We will have members of the NYPD at 1,201 polling locations across the five boroughs on election day and at the 88 locations in the city that begin early voting on Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NYPD also has special teams at the ready to &#8220;respond throughout the city,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He stressed that the NYPD always sends police officers to polling sites on Election Day, but acknowledged that this year was different, requiring more officers than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no secret that this election is more contentious than in years past,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beginning on Oct. 25, we will have hundreds of additional cops in uniform citywide who will be at the ready should they be needed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And each of these officers will be briefed daily with any information that might affect voting locations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed out that the NYPD will provide officers for the three new voting locations this year: the Barclays Center, Madison Square Garden and Lincoln Center, where large numbers of people are expected to cast their ballots.</p>
<p>To prepare, the NYPD ran through tabletop exercises and retrained officers in crowd control, he said. The department has <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/30/nypd-response-on-george-floyd-protest-violated-human-rights-report/">come under scrutiny</a> for its handling of some of the George Floyd protests in the city over the summer.</p>

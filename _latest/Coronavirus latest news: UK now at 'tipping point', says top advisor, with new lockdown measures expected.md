The UK is now at a coronavirus “tipping point” and deaths “will now follow”, one of the Government’s top scientific advisors has warned, as talks continue to finalise new local lockdown restrictions.

Tougher local lockdown restrictions are expected to be imposed on parts of the North West from tomorrow, including a possible ban on household mixing.

Boris Johnson is expected to announce the new three-tier “Local Covid Alert Level” system on Monday, which will place areas into areas of low, mid and high risk.

Liverpool could be placed into the third tier, which would include the toughest restrictions - which is understood to include guidance asking residents not to travel outside of their area unless for reasons such as work or education - according to Joe Anderson, the city mayor, following discussions with No 10.

It comes as Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, warned the nation is now “at a tipping point similar to where we were in March” in our fight against Covid-19.

Prof Van-Tam said in a statement: “Although the epidemic re-started in younger adult age groups in the last few weeks, there is clear evidence of gradual spread into older age groups in the worst affected areas.

“Sadly, just as night follows day, increases in deaths will now follow on in the next few weeks.”

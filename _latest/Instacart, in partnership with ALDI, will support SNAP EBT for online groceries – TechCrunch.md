<div><p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instacart" target="_blank">Instacart </a> is making its grocery delivery and pickup services more accessible to lower-income customers by offering customers the ability to pay for groceries using their SNAP (<a class="Link" href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a>) benefits. This is the first time Instacart shoppers have been able to use government assistance programs when paying for groceries, and follows earlier moves by larger retailers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/amazon-expands-use-of-snap-benefits-for-online-grocery-to-11-more-states/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/walmart-now-accepts-snap-for-online-grocery-orders-at-all-2500-pickup-locations/">Walmart</a>, and others in extending SNAP EBT to online grocery.</p>
<p>In Instacart&#8217;s case, the option is being made available in partnership with ALDI, which will offer the ability for SNAP EBT participants to access fresh food and other staples using the online service.</p>
<p>When shopping, Instacart users will be able to add ALDI&#8217;s EBT SNAP-eligible items to their cart, then select how much of their benefits they want to allocate to their order before checking out.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p></p><img class="vertical size-large wp-image-2064595" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/00-EBT-Cart.png?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680"><p>The program will launch over the new few weeks, and will first arrive at ALDI&#8217;s over 60 Georgia stores before expanding to over 570 stores across Illinois, California, Florida and Pennsylvania in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Instacart says it runs its Customer and Shopper Care team from Atlanta, which one reason why it selected Georgia as the debut market &#8212; adding it was important to first support the communities where its own employees live and work.</p>
<p>Today, online grocery shopping is often seen as a luxury service, but that should not be the case. Often, it&#8217;s just as affordable to shop online than in-store (if using the pickup option, at least), as customers can more easily compare prices with other retailers online. For some lower-income customers, online shopping can also save time when they&#8217;re stretched between jobs and family commitments.</p>
<p>The pandemic has now further <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/30/844361467/coronavirus-pandemic-complicates-getting-groceries-with-snap">complicated</a> access to food for those on SNAP benefits, and in particular, for high-risk individuals. These customers now have to take risks with their lives and health to shop in-store, making online grocery more of a necessity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The introduction of Instacart&#8217;s EBT SNAP payments comes at a time when food insecurity in the U.S. has compounded as the nation continues to be impacted by COVID-19,&#8221; Instacart stated in its <a href="https://news.instacart.com/instacart-and-aldi-announce-ebt-snap-pilot-to-increase-access-to-same-day-grocery-delivery-and-af02cb042d6d">announcement</a>. &#8220;According to Feeding America, due to the effects of the pandemic, more than 54 million people may experience food insecurity in 2020, which includes a potential 18 million children. In Georgia specifically, food insecurity impacts 12.5% of the population and disproportionately affects communities of color,&#8221; it noted.</p>
<p>Instacart is now one of several online retailers supporting SNAP EBT for groceries.</p>
<p>Before the coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture had been working to make online grocery more accessible to SNAP recipients through <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/online-purchasing-pilot">an online purchasing pilot program</a> with support of retailers including Amazon, Walmart, ShopRite, and others. The pilot retailers&#160; have made it possible to shop for groceries online, then pay using SNAP EBT.</p>
<p>ALDI and Instacart are not listed on the USDA&#8217;s website as program participants, however.</p>

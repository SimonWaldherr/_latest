<div><p>A member of the Breonna Taylor grand jury did not believe her shooting was justified and had asked about bringing additional charges against the cops who fired their weapons at her, a report said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The unidentified juror said in a statement through a lawyer that the only charge presented to them by prosecutors was wanton endangerment, which former Louisville detective Brett Hankison was hit with last month.</p>
<p>Hankison was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/28/brett-hankison-pleads-not-guilty-to-endangering-neighbors/">charged with the crime</a> for firing into her neighbor&#8217;s apartment during the botched drug raid that left Taylor dead. No cops were charged with her killing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Questions were asked about the additional charges and the grand jury was told there would be none because the prosecutors didn&#8217;t feel they could make them stick,&#8221; the juror&#8217;s statement said, according to NBC News.</p>
<p>&#8220;The grand jury didn&#8217;t agree that certain actions were justified, nor did it decide the indictment should be the only charges in the Breonna Taylor case,&#8221; the statement adds.</p>
<p>The juror said homicide laws were not explained to the panel after they had asked about the law, NBC reported.</p>
<p>The officers, who <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/25/newly-released-bodycam-footage-shows-moments-after-breonna-taylor-raid/">had a no-knock warrant</a>, killed Taylor on March 13 after entering her Louisville apartment and exchanging gunfire with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has said he believed he was firing at intruders breaking into the apartment &#8212; not police officers.</p>
<p>Police were looking for drugs in the apartment during the raid, but none were recovered.</p>
<p>Hours of recordings of the grand jury were <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/02/hours-of-breonna-taylor-grand-jury-audio-recordings-released/">released earlier this month</a>, giving a rare glimpse into what the Kentucky panel heard before it returned no indictments against cops for her killing.</p>

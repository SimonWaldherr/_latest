 <p>     </p> <p>The stunned mum told how she &#8220;blew a gasket&#8221; after snapping this photo of him curled up for a nap on the tiles before kicking him out of her home three days into what was promised to be a two-day job.</p> <p>Oddly, tradesman Luke, of Libra Plumbing, blamed the incident on a hot drink Rachel made him - telling the Record: &#8220;I finished the cup of tea and can&#8217;t remember anything until waking up&#8221;.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Rachael has had to source a new fitter and is expected to be left thousands of pounds out of pocket.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>She said: &#8220;I&#8217;m just left in limbo with a big mess. This is appalling behaviour and needs to be exposed.&#8221;</p> <p>The mum-of-two paid a &#163;715 deposit to the bathroom company for her goods and a further &#163;1260 on delivery.</p> <p>She had been told to expect to pay the fitters &#163;900 on completion of the job.</p> <p>The work got under way last Monday and was expected to be completed by the end of Tuesday, but the job was hit by delays.</p></div>

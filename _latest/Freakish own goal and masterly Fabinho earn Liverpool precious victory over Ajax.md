<div><p>It is impossible to replace the irreplaceable but Liverpool surely found a solution for now for the loss of Virgil van Dijk as Fabinho produced an outstanding performance in the centre of their defence as they began their Champions League campaign with a precious away victory.</p>
<p>The winning goal against Ajax was freakish but Liverpool will believe they have deserved some luck after the terrible anterior cruciate ligament injury that &#160;has ruled out their best defender, and arguably the best in the world, for possibly the rest of this season.</p>
<p>All the talk had been of Van Dijk&#8217;s absence and the effect it would have on Liverpool who will be almost as pleased with the clean sheet as the points although, in truth, they were fortunate not to concede against a vibrant young Ajax side in the heavy Amsterdam rain.</p>
<p>Liverpool also defended differently without Van Dijk, dropping deeper and with Fabinho filling in from midfield as he has done before and to great effect although it may be a disservice to the Brazilian to expect him to stay in that role for the coming months. Liverpool, despite Fabinho&#8217;s outstanding display, inevitably appear more vulnerable without him in his usual position and that will be a worry with the taxing schedule to come.</p>
<p>Liverpool&#8217;s lead was gained in the strangest manner and came within seconds of a move in which Ajax should have gone ahead themselves. It was Sadio Mane who turned sharply to spin centre-half Perr Schuurs from a throw-in and create the space to shoot - only to take a chunk out of the turf with the ball miscued across goal. However Nicolas Tagliafico made a horrible mess of it as he attempted to clear only to side-foot into his own net with goalkeeper Andre Onana stranded.</p>
<p>How Ajax will have been frustrated by that and by Quincy Promes&#8217;s inability to beat Adrian from close range after the winger &#8211; who had come on for the injured 20-year-old Ghanaian forward Mohammed Kudus &#8211; exchanged passes with David Neres. Adrian pushed out a boot to deflect his shot away.</p>

It’s erection season.

With the 2020 presidential vote just weeks away, porn star Cherie DeVille is launching an effort to get her fans to the polls.

“There is so much at stake. I want to convince anyone I can, even if I have to appeal to their penis,” DeVille 42, told The Post. “I think that the country is going through a lot and I hear a lot of people in casual conversations being very upset about a variety of things.”

DeVille has launched a website — ErectionSeason.com — which mixes sex and civics, complete with a video explaining the project and links to voter information in all 50 states.

“If someone tries to c–kblock you from exercising your democratic rights, call the Voter Protection Hotline at 1-866-687-8683,” the website advises.

DeVille, star of such productions as “Cougar Sandwich” and “Assablanca,” and who calls herself “the internet’s favorite stepmom,” plans to leverage her more than 2.7 million followers on social media to share voting information.

“I am going to start blasting it all over the platforms that I have control over — my Instagram, my Twitter — and mobilize as many of my followers to get out and vote,” she said.

Though her views are avowedly left-leaning, DeVille said her get-out-the-vote effort is nonpartisan. She declined to say who she was backing in the 2020 presidential election.

“I truly mean it when I say I want all people to get out and vote and I don’t want to polarize people with my opinions,” she said.

The North Carolina native has embraced activism in recent years. She penned an op-ed in the Daily Beast warning of potential COVID-19 outbreaks among adult film stars and once announced a run for president.

“I have had enough. I am tired of being misrepresented and I am tired of being lied to by the political leaders. I am fed up with the circus that is the White House today,” she said in an August 2017 press conference. “We will make American f–king awesome again.” DeVille was joined on stage by rapper and running mate Coolio.

A campaign website touted progressive positions on marijuana legalization, immigration and climate change. A universal health care plan — dubbed ‘Coolio care’ — was in the works. DeVille suspended the campaign in 2019, citing lack of funds. She boasts she “nearly won” the nomination of the Reform Party.

(A party spokesman told The Post they never heard of her.)

Coolio is also gearing up to plug her latest political effort.

“We need people voting man, every vote counts,” the rapper told The Post.

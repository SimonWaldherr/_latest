<div><p>In Las Vegas even the statues are wearing masks.</p>
<p>The 15ft white emperor that greets gamblers at the entrance of Caesars Palace has a cherub by his right foot and a gold covering stretched across his mouth.</p>
<p>It is a reminder of the damage the pandemic has wrought on the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/usa/">epicentre of American extravagance</a>, a city driven by tourism and reliant on people willing to let loose. Inside the casino resort there are more reminders.</p>
<p>Plexiglass screens divide poker players. Slot machine stickers order a seat to be left between users. Everywhere masks are mandatory. It is the emptiness that sticks out most.</p>
<p>&#8220;This place is normally 100 times busier&#8221;, says David Sajdak, a 62-year-old resident, as he looks out over the gaming floor one weekday morning. &#8220;Or a 1,000 times.&#8221;</p>

  In Rare Move, Trump Administration Rejects California’s Request for Wildfire Relief

The handling of wildfires has become highly politicized during Mr. Trump’s presidency. Last year, the president threatened to cut off funding for wildfire relief unless California improved the management of its forests.

“Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen,” Mr. Trump tweeted in January 2019. “Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money.”

Mr. Trump’s threat at the time alarmed both Republicans and Democrats in the state. And wildfire experts say Mr. Trump’s analysis is problematic because most of California’s forests are on land owned by the federal government and their maintenance largely falls under the responsibility of his administration.

As wildfires have become hotter, more intense and more destructive in recent years liberals and conservatives in the state have been locked in a debate over the reasons. During a visit to California in September, Mr. Trump said “I don’t think science knows” what is happening when the state’s secretary for natural resources pressed him on the changing climate.

“One camp is saying it’s all climate change driven, and the other saying it’s all forest management,” said Malcolm North a forest ecologist at the University of California, Davis. “The reality is that it’s both. I get kind of frustrated at this all-or-nothing type of approach.”

Professor North said the lightning-ignited fires in conifer forests this summer in California were driven in large part by decades of fire suppression — putting out forest fires — and a lack of stewardship that allowed forests to build up two or three times the timber and brush that they have had historically.

Business owners have said extra wage subsidies announced by the Chancellor will help to keep staff in their jobs over winter, while others are distraught after being excluded from support yet again.

Rishi Sunak has announced an extension to the new Job Support Scheme, which starts in November. The Government will hand extra support to businesses legally required to shut down for some periods over the winter months due to “local lockdowns”. The state will pay them grants equivalent to two thirds of each employees’ salary, up to a maximum of £2,100 a month, to retain staff who cannot work for at least seven days due to the restrictions.

Crucially, those businesses that qualify under the extension will not have to top up staff wages as under the main scheme, although they will still be asked to cover National Insurance and pension contributions.

Peter Kinsella, who owns the Lunya deli and restaurant business based in Liverpool, where pubs are expected to face new restrictions, said the extra help could save more than half his workforce if he has to shut down his sites.

“We would have been forced to lay off two thirds of our workers without more help. We have 65 staff. We used to have 95 but we had to close one of our restaurants in Manchester. We now have just the two sites left in Liverpool,” he said.

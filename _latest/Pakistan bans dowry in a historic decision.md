A law has been passed in the country to ban dowry. In a rather historic decision, Pakistan becomes the first Muslim country to do so. The Minister of Religious Affairs of Pakistan, has decided to ban the tradition of dowry which basically revolves around the groomâ€™s family asking for either expensive gifts, furniture, cars and in extreme cases property to put it on display.

However, with this decision taken, the dowry will only include clothes that belong to the bride and bedsheets only as per tenets of Islamic Sunnah. According to the bill, the maximum amount to be given to the bride as her dowry will be no more than four tola gold. Also, guests arriving at the marriage ceremony will be banned from giving gifts costing more than PKR 1,000.

On a note of positivity, this law has been implemented in all provinces including Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh. This will also help cater expenses that the bride family has to bear in order to fulfill social and traditional customs.

Amazon Prime Day 2020 is back on October 13-14.

Ahead of the shopping event, Amazon created several ways to fill your account with bonus credits.

Below, we show you how to take advantage of all the great offers and deals available ahead of the sales event in mid-October.

A bit of preparation could help maximize the savings you'll get when the big day arrives.

But first, you'll need to be an Amazon Prime member.

For any event — a half-marathon, a surprise party, a trip to a new city — preparation is key. And yes, this even includes Amazon Prime Day.

After months of speculation, Amazon Prime Day 2020 will take place next week on, October 13-14. The annual sales event certainly warrants some extra preparation ahead of time since it features hundreds of thousands of deals, coming in and out of stock.

This year, more so than in past years, it pays to do some legwork ahead of the big show. Amazon created several offers, detailed below, to give shoppers an incentive to explore everything the retail giant has to offer. Interested shoppers can earn as much as $100 in bonus credits when shopping for products from small businesses and Amazon's brick-and-mortar locations.

However, time's ticking on these offers since they expire when Prime Day arrives.

We will be here to make shopping during Prime Day as smooth as possible, with deal roundups and resources like the guide below. Read up on everything related to Amazon Prime Day 2020 here.

As it stands, only Amazon Prime members can access the deals featured on Prime Day — so you'll need to make sure you're a subscriber. If you find that your subscription lapsed, but don't want to be on the hook for the $119 annual subscription cost, don't fret. You can pick up a monthly subscription for $13.

For the would-be first-time subscribers, there's enough time between now and when Prime Day begins that it's safe to sign up for the 30-day free trial and take advantage of all the perks (including shopping Prime Day) without paying.

While it would be tempting to wait until the last minute to sign up, we encourage you to start your membership as soon as possible. You'll need a subscription to access the early discounts available, but also gain access to all of the pre-Prime Day credit opportunities.

Download the Amazon app

You can use the Amazon app all year long to streamline your mobile shopping experience, but it's particularly useful for Prime Day. Before Prime Day goes live, go to the "Deals" section of the app, where you'll be able to view all upcoming deals. Click "Watch this deal" to receive an alert the moment it goes live. The app organizes all the deals you're interested in, so just pay attention to your phone notifications if you want to grab a deal before it's gone.

Better still, the Amazon app is required when shopping Amazon's physical stores and, more importantly, claiming bonus credits ahead of the shopping holiday.

Collect bonus credits

Ahead of the shopping event, Amazon created several avenues for shoppers to earn credit to use during the two-day event. We've listed them here, plus a few bonus ways to seek more value.

Narrow down what you want to buy

It's smart to go into Prime Day with at least some idea of what you want to buy (and save on). If you need some inspiration from your fellow Insider readers, these were the 30 top-selling products from last year's Prime Day.

Amazon devices will most likely enjoy significant discounts. If you're able to, we recommend holding off until Prime Day to make your next Echo or Kindle purchase. Amazon now makes tons of different devices, from tablets and TVs to speakers and yes, even microwaves.

Your Prime Day wish list doesn't have to include a bestseller or an Amazon device — but you should compile some type of list to make shopping more efficient.

It bears repeating that Amazon Prime Day 2020 will not be the final sales event of the year. Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which may offer a larger selection of products, are still in the books for late November. So, if the product you want doesn't go on sale, don't settle for retail price.

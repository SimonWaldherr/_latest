Pity the poor passport. Essential though it is for travel abroad, and for proving that we are who we are at home, it’s fated to spend its time hidden away for safe keeping, its pages rarely scrutinised by anyone but weary bureaucrats.

Its twin tasks are to distil the identity of both bearer and issuing nation, but it often leaves us cringing at our own photographic likeness and puzzling over the antiquated sense of nationhood that crests and gilt lettering convey. And yet, the passport is an artefact rich in visual and historic narrative – one that gestures to our universal similarities even as it highlights borders.

Traditionally, passport design has rarely invited curiosity. For instance, Taiwan’s design – a dark green jacket emblazoned with a stylised sun shining from within a plain gold ring – is typical of administrative aesthetics at their most staid.

Recently, however, the island’s pro-independence New Power Party set about crowdsourcing images for a redesign via a competition. There was a pointedly political dimension. The contest came about in response to a resolution passed in parliament in July to emphasise the word “Taiwan”, which on existing travel documents sits below the words “Republic of China”, causing, legislators argued, confusion abroad. The majority of finalists took it a step further, not through their choice of motifs, which were both playful and traditional, but via a crucial omission: those three English words, “Republic of China”, were nowhere to be seen.

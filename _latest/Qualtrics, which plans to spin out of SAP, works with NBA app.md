<li>As the NBA kept games going during the pandemic, it used Qualtrics software to build an app for players and staff in its "bubble" that could gather feedback on the coronavirus testing process, food options, recreational activities, and more.</li>

<p>NBA games were put on hold when the coronavirus first started spreading through the US in March and remained paused until July, when the league launched a plan to allow the action to start back up.&#160;</p><p>To allow teams to keep competing, the NBA created a "bubble": An isolation zone at Walt Disney World where players would live, getting regularly tested without venturing into the outside world.&#160;&#160;To make sure that players and staff were staying safe and having an enjoyable experience on the campus, the NBA built an app using Qualtrics in the span of about two weeks.&#160;</p><p>Every player and coach in the bubble has access to this app, which uses Qualtrics software to collect their input on a range of matters, including how their day is going, what their needs are, feedback on the testing or food delivery process, and more.&#160;</p><p>"There's incredible foresight from the NBA to gather this data about how people are feeling, especially with the mental health crisis going on," Qualtrics cofounder and CEO Ryan Smith told Business Insider.</p><p>Qualtrics has worked with the NBA since 2016, making it a natural pick when the league needed to put the app together.&#160;</p><p>

</p><p>Within the company, Qualtrics too has been using its own software to check if employees are feeling satisfied and productive while working from home.

<p>Users get a push notification through the app about twice a week so they can share how they're doing, why, and give feedback on how the NBA can make their experience better. Based on this data, the NBA can quickly fix issues that arise, whether it's with meals, testing processes, or recreational opportunities.&#160;</p><p>"The NBA had the sense to institute a listening platform that allows them to have a system of action," head of global insights at Qualtrics, Michael Maughan, told Business Insider.&#160; "It helps everyone in the bubble feel heard and taken care of."</p><p>With Qualtrics, the NBA can get an aggregate view about any issues that have arisen, easily spin up data visualizations, and receive recommendations on what to do based on user feedback.</p><p>"Their trends analysis allowed us to visualize how the campus changed week-to-week as people became more comfortable with the campus environment and amenities offered," Flatow told Business Insider.</p><p>So far, the NBA has used responses collected from this app to negotiate improvements to its meals, including creating better food stations, diversifying the off-campus restaurants available for delivery, and expanding menus and hours on the NBA campuses.&#160;</p><p>In addition, the NBA has redesigned protocols so that its staff can participate in activities like golfing, fishing, watching outdoor movies, practicing outdoor yoga, and boating in a safe way.&#160;Finally, the NBA revised security checkpoints and improved transportation schedules based on user feedback.&#160;</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/qualtrics-ryan-smith-sap-states-coronavirus-testing-2020-5">Qualtrics, the enterprise tech company that SAP decided to buy for $8 billion days before its IPO, is repurposing its software for COVID-19 testing and to keep employees happy during remote work</a></p><p>"The main lesson we've seen for COVID is the biggest experience gap most organizations have had is they jumped to productivity and saw employees could get stuff done and forgot to ask employees if they're OK," Qualtrics' Maughan said. "That's what's so instrumental. In addition to their incredible vision to create the bubble, [the NBA] also recognized the incredible humanity of the situation."</p>

<div><p>A top New York state election official and Mayor Bill de Blasio are urging New York City residents to vote early in person beginning Saturday as the local Board of Elections grapples with processing and counting a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/11/new-york-bracing-for-5m-mail-in-ballots-for-2020-election/">tidal wave</a> of mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The city elections agency as of Monday had processed more than 1 million absentee ballot applications submitted by voters.</p>
<p>BOE executive director Michael Ryan reported that the agency has processed all but about 9,000 of the ballot requests and its two printing contractors are &#8220;up to date&#8221; with sending out the ballots to voters following <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/06/board-of-elections-resends-99k-ballots-in-brooklyn-amid-snafu/">the botched mailings</a> sent to Brooklyn voters a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Still, the printing snafu triggered a&#160; backlash and prompted the state Senate&#8217;s Election Committee chairman, Zellnor Myrie of Brooklyn, to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/01/top-ny-lawmaker-urges-in-person-voting-amid-ballot-fiasco/">promote early in-person voting</a> over mailing in absentee ballots.</p>
<p>Early voting runs for nine days from Oct. 24 to Nov. 1 at 88 polling sites preceding the Nov. 3 election. All the sites will adhere to safety protocols to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/11/nyc-to-open-88-early-voting-sites-including-daycares-schools/">prevent the spread</a> of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The last day to request an absentee ballot is Oct. 27.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early voting we recommend as the best option of the three options [instead of mail-in ballot or Election Day voting],&#8221; said NYS Board of Elections co-chairman Doug Kellner, who monitors city elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The early voting option was underutilized during the primary. The early voting sites are larger, have more staff and usually don&#8217;t have long lines,&#8221; added Kellner, who expects some problems with long lines on Election Day.</p>
<p>De Blasio also banged the early voting drum during a press briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be early voting myself and want to really encourage people to take advantage of early voting. I think Election Day is going to be a huge, huge turnout. We obviously don&#8217;t want to see people in lines more than they need to be,&#8221; de Blasio said.</p>
<p>People who vote early in person will have their votes counted as part of the machine count on election night.</p>
<p>By comparison, the more tedious counting of hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots won&#8217;t happen until after Election Day, a process that could take weeks.</p>
<p>The mail-in ballots have to be checked against the machine count to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/long-island-man-busted-for-asking-mail-in-ballots-for-dead-mom/">prevent against</a> double-voting fraud.</p>
<p>In addition, lawyers for candidates involved in close races can scrutinize the mail-in ballots and lawsuits could be filed that could bog down the counting. Snafus with the processing, mailing and counting of absentee ballots in Brooklyn emerged <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/05/84000-mail-in-ballots-disqualified-in-nyc-primary-election/">as vexing problems</a> during the June 23 primary.</p>
<p>Under state law, local election agencies must certify the vote by Nov. 28. The Electoral College meets on Dec.14 to certify the presidential election.</p>
<p>Kellner said he doesn&#8217;t want a repeat of the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/04/rep-maloney-declares-victory-in-primary-says-results-were-certified/">slow counting</a> of mail-in ballots that occurred in the city during the primary and vowed state election officials will more aggressively monitor the city BOE to speed up the count. Two Democratic primary congressional races weren&#8217;t called until early August &#8212; six weeks after the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get involved to make sure the schedule is maintained,&#8221; Kellner said.</p>
 
<p>Kellner recommended $50 million in additional funding for local election agencies, though he said de Blasio has &#8220;made good on his commitment&#8221; to fund the city BOE.</p>
<p>The head of one government watchdog warned that inadequate funding could prolong vote counts in some parts of the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;In smaller counties it&#8217;s a question of staffing and money. At the New York City Board of Elections, it&#8217;s not a question of money but competence,&#8221; said John Kaehny, director of Reinvent Albany.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s budget office said the state <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/10/cuomo-urged-to-release-50-million-to-prevent-covid-19-election-chaos/">can&#8217;t afford</a> to dish out $50 million to local election agencies.</p>

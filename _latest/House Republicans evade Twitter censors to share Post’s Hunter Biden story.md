House Judiciary Committee Republicans on Wednesday copied and pasted The Post’s censored cover story on Hunter Biden’s alleged hard drive and encouraged people to share the link on Twitter.

Twitter blocked users from sharing The Post’s own link to the story, which describes an alleged 2015 email from Ukrainian energy company Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi thanking Hunter Biden for “giving an opportunity to meet your father.”

“Twitter has blocked users from tweeting the link to the @nypost’s story on Hunter Biden. So we put it on our website for you to read and share. Click, share, and RT!” the @JudiciaryGOP account tweeted.

About 5,000 users retweeted the link within 30 minutes.

Twitter did not immediately censor the link, which directs users to a .gov webpage on an official US government site.

Biden, who led the Obama administration Ukraine policy, said last year, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” including his reported $83,000 monthly pay on Burisma’s board.

Twitter said Wednesday it prevented users from tweeting or direct-messaging a link to the article because it violated a ban on distributing hacked material.

The alleged Hunter Biden hard drive was given to The Post by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney to President Trump, after he received it from a Delaware computer repairman.

The repairman says he legally accessed the content under an abandonment contract clause when Hunter Biden did not collect a damaged laptop within 90 days.

Facebook, meanwhile, said it was taking unspecified steps to limit distribution of The Post’s article pending “fact-checking.”

Republican lawmakers on Wednesday cited the article censorship by Twitter and Facebook in calls for reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a foundational internet liability shield for sites that host third-party content. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) separately requested a Federal Election Commission investigation.

Supporters of reforming Section 230 say tech giants should lose protections if they operate as a publisher, rather than as a neutral platform.

“Condemnation is not enough. It’s time to reform Section 230,” wrote Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.

“Twitter is attempting to meddle in the election with anti-conservative bias. @jack is acting like a publisher, making the case yet again to reform Section 230,” Buck wrote.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the panel’s top Republican, wrote, “Big Tech claims they aren’t biased against Conservatives. So why are they suppressing speech to help the Democrats? Section 230!”

<p>The CEO of one of the US's largest mall operators says malls will have to make some big changes to survive.&#160;</p><p>"This has been a very passive industry," Lou Conforti, the CEO of Washington Prime Group, told Business Insider in a recent interview. "We were rent collectors versus problem solvers or curators."&#160;</p><p>Conforti doesn't even like to use the word "mall" because of its "negative connotation" &#8212; he prefers "retail venue" instead. The company's portfolio includes a mix of open-air and traditional enclosed shopping centers.&#160;</p><p>Washington Prime, which was spun off from Simon Property Group in 2014, is introducing innovations that it hopes will make its retail venues more attractive to both tenants and shoppers, while blending e-commerce and in-person purchases.&#160;</p><p>At the beginning of the year, Washington Prime launched a new initiative called Fulventory, offering its tenants the ability to turn an empty mall space into a place where they could facilitate services that allowed customers to buy online and pick up in store and buy online and return in store. Existing mall tenants can also use the space to run clearance sales on excess inventory.&#160;</p><p>They can choose between small, medium, and large spaces, and Washington Prime is charging a lower rent to use them than it would for a traditional retail store.&#160;</p><p>So far, Washington Prime has partnered with West Virginia University Medicine to create a logistics, distribution, and fulfillment center in the Morgantown Mall in Morgantown, West Virginia. The fulfillment center services 11 hospitals and a number of clinics in the WVU Medicine network.</p><p>Washington Prime has also brought on Dick's Sporting Goods &#8212; <a href="https://investor.washingtonprime.com/investor-relations/news-and-views/news/news-details/2020/Dicks-Sporting-Goods-Opens-Warehouse-Sale-Location-at-Lake-View-Plaza-Demonstrating-Further-Demand-for-Washington-Prime-Groups-Fulventory-Initiative-/default.aspx">which opened</a> a Warehouse Sale clearance location at Lake View Plaza in Orland Park, Illinois &#8212; to the Fulventory initiative, as well as unnamed active-lifestyle and women's-fashion tenants.</p>

<p>Conforti said the service was meant to help retailers bridge the gap between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar sales, which he says is essential to meeting the needs of today's shoppers.&#160;</p><p>Shoppers might want to order an item online but be able to pick it up the same day in store, without having to pay for shipping. They might not want to spend so much time browsing stores in person as the coronavirus pandemic remains a concern in the US.</p><p>"Dark stores" &#8212; or locations dedicated exclusively to fulfilling online orders &#8212; are a growing trend in retail. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/macys-stores-fulfillment-pickup-centers-2020-10">Macy's recently closed stores</a> in Littleton, Colorado, and Dover, Delaware, to dedicate them exclusively to fulfillment and order pickup for the holiday season.&#160;</p><p>"There's this symbiotic relationship between e-commerce and physical retailing, but they both need to be more user-friendly," Conforti said.&#160;</p><p>Another benefit of Fulventory, Conforti said, is finding new purposes for large, empty retail spaces. The WVU Medical space, for example, is in an 80,000-square-foot former Sears store.</p><p>In August, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-and-giant-mall-operator-look-at-turning-sears-j-c-penney-stores-into-fulfillment-centers-11596992863">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Amazon was in talks with Simon Property Group to turn former Sears and JCPenney stores into fulfillment centers. Amazon and Simon both previously declined to confirm those reports, saying they don't comment on rumors or speculation.&#160;</p><h2>'We beta test the s--- out of stuff'</h2><p>Retailers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-filed-bankruptcy-liquidation-closing-stores-2020-2">continue to file for bankruptcy protection</a> at an elevated pace in 2020, with companies like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ann-taylor-loft-parent-ascena-files-for-bankruptcy-closes-stores-2020-7">Ascena Retail Group</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jcpenney-closing-stores-list-addresses-updated-2020-7">JCPenney</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-and-co-rtw-retailwinds-bankruptcy-2020-6">RTW Retailwinds</a> announcing plans to close hundreds of stores.</p><p>Washington Prime collected <a href="https://investor.washingtonprime.com/investor-relations/news-and-views/news/news-details/2020/Washington-Prime-Group-Announces-Second-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx">just 44% of its rent</a> in the second quarter. Of the 56% that was not paid, 30% was due to rent-deferral agreements with tenants, while 26% was because of bankruptcy or pandemic-related lease modifications, according to the company.</p>

<p>A recent Barclays analysis <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/mall-values-could-b.html">reported on by CNBC</a> estimated that 15 to 17% of US malls would need to be redeveloped to serve other purposes in the long term. That's not great news for property owners &#8212; according to Barclays, turning a dead mall into a fulfillment center could mean a loss in property value of between 60 and 90%.&#160;</p><p>

</p><p>Conforti said the keys to malls' survival were in diversifying tenants and creating innovative spaces. He said the mall sector has historically been a "lazy-a-- business."&#160;</p><p>"We had a lot of overleveraged private-equity-sponsored tenants that were crummy merchandisers, and guess what? They should go away," he said.</p><p>This summer, Washington Prime hosted a series of <a href="https://investor.washingtonprime.com/investor-relations/news-and-views/news/news-details/2020/Summer-Sweat-Series-Promotes-Physical-and-Mental-Wellbeing-at-Washington-Prime-Group-Town-Centers-/default.aspx">socially distanced exercise classes</a> as well as a <a href="https://investor.washingtonprime.com/investor-relations/news-and-views/news/news-details/2020/Washington-Prime-Group-Brings-Community-Together-with-Cinema-Under-the-Stars/default.aspx">drive-in movie series</a> in some of its parking lots.&#160;</p><p>It also struck a deal to bring Amazon Lockers to a number of its properties in 2016.</p><p>Ultimately, Confort said, it comes down to trying a lot of new things and seeing what sticks.&#160;</p><p>"Beta tests are the most important thing this industry can do because guess what? You're supposed to fail," he said. "You shouldn't rely on something because ... it was done 30 years ago."</p><p>"We need to have a lot of dynamism in this space," he added. "So we beta test the s--- out of stuff."</p>

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told "CBS Evening News" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell that the United States needs to redouble its efforts to contain the coronavirus as we enter the fall and winter months.

"What we really have to do is double down" on preventive measures like social distancing and wearing masks, Fauci said in the interview Wednesday. He noted that coronavirus cases are surging in 37 states, a concerning rise affecting over three-quarters of the country.

"That is not a good sign as you're entering into the cooler weather," Fauci warned. He stressed that the same protocols health officials have been advising for months — wash your hands frequently, social distance, wear a mask, avoid crowds — are as essential as ever, seven months into the pandemic.

"They sound very simple, but people are not doing that and that's why we have an uptick in cases," he said.

Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also spoke about President Trump's recent COVID-19 diagnosis and recovery.

"We're very pleased" with how well Mr. Trump is doing, he said. But he also warned that not everyone who contracts the virus will be so fortunate.

In the interview, Fauci also said the pandemic is going to change the way his family, and many others around the country, celebrate the upcoming holidays.

"My Thanksgiving is going to look very different this year," he said, noting that his children won't be coming in from out of town "out of concern for me and my age."

This is a developing story and will be updated.

Portions of Norah O'Donnell's interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci will air on the "CBS Evening News" on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. ET on CBS and 10 p.m. ET on CBSN.

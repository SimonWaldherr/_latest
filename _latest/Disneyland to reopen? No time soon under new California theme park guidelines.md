As might be expected, the plan brought an immediate rebuke from Disneyland's top official as unfair, unworkable and sure to keep the park shut.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm are in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, which is in the third category, labeled "substantial." Universal Studios Hollywood is in Los Angeles County, which is in the lowest category, "widespread."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Dr. Mark Ghaly, California's secretary of Health and Human Services, said on a conference call&#160;that the guidelines are realistic, noting that San Francisco County achieved the highest level. That level requires there be less than one case a day per 100,000 residents and a testing positivity rate of less than 2%.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-experience_america-theme_parks-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We believe it is possible, and San Francisco is a great case in point," he said, though it requires "a lot of work" and "a lot of vigilance" on the part of officials and citizens to protect themselves and their neighbors from the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But Disneyland President Ken Potrock issued&#160;a statement&#160;blasting&#160;the state's new rules as "mandating arbitrary guidelines that it knows are unworkable and that hold us to a standard vastly different from other reopened businesses and state-operated facilities."</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-experience_america-theme_parks-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He acknowledged the rules won't allow Disneyland, Orange County's largest employer, to reopen anytime soon.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"These state guidelines will keep us shuttered for the foreseeable future, forcing thousands more people out of work, leading to the inevitable closure of small family-owned businesses, and irreparably devastating the Anaheim/Southern California community,&#8221;&#8203; Potrock said&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When large theme parks are allowed to reopen, they will be limited to 25% capacity.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">California created a separate set of guidelines for smaller attractions, allowing them to reopen at the "moderate" level, but only with outdoor attractions and also only at 25% capacity.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Gov. Gavin Newsom indicated during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXaEstnNhnE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">weekly news conference </a>Monday that it was important to recognize differences in the nature of different theme parks.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to break up the theme parks," Newsom said. "It&#8217;s not just one or two brands. It&#8217;s many different parts that are part of the theme park industry."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">California's approach is markedly different than what has occurred in Florida. California's Orange County reported coronavirus cases at a rate of 37 cases per week per 100,000 people for the week of&#160;Oct. 13-19,&#160;according to Johns Hopkins University data.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Orange County, Florida, home to Disney World, reported coronavirus cases at a rate of 101 cases per week per 100,000 people for the same period. That's nearly three times California's infection rate, and yet Florida has allowed theme parks there to remain open while California's remain shuttered.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It seems to me that the guidelines that are set up by the state of California are more stringent than any state across the country," Disney CEO Bob Chapek told CNBC in an&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2020/10/13/disney-world-attendance-remain-capped-new-cdc-covid-19-guidance/5977875002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">interview&#160;last week</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Newsom has repeatedly cited the arrival of cooler temperatures&#160;and flu season as grounds for additional caution.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;This is an area of obvious and real concern,&#8221; Newsom said during his news conference. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re being very sober, and &#8211; forgive me&#160;&#8211; stubborn about some industries in the state that I know are eager to get guidelines.&#8221;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-experience_america-theme_parks-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The parks have been been closed for seven months now and in limbo since the summer&#160;as they waited for the state to announce the benchmarks for reopening.&#160; Disneyland, which <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/06/24/disneyland-california-delays-reopening-past-july-17/3255300001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">scrapped its planned July 17 reopening</a> because of this summer's COVID-19 spike, and Universal Studios&#160;could only watch and take notes&#160;as their&#160;Florida counterparts reopened.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But even though Disney's and Universal's&#160;Orlando parks opened without spurring new COVID-19 surges, it wasn't enough to prevent financial upheaval.&#160;In late September, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/09/29/coronavirus-effect-disney-lay-off-28-000-california-florida/3579963001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Disney announced&#160;layoffs of 28,000 employees</a> in California and Florida, and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/08/09/disney-world-reduce-hours-september-visits-drop-amid-covid-19/3330470001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Disney World shortened its hours</a> in response to&#160;smaller-than-anticipated crowds.

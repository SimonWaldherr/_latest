While closing all bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants could have a “moderate” impact on the R, closing them early would make little difference, the papers suggest.

“Curfews likely to have a marginal impact,” they note, suggesting that allowing customers to sit outside only would be likely to be much lower risk.

The papers are damning about the NHS Test and Trace system, which the Prime Minister has said would be "world beating".

"The relatively low levels of engagement with the system... coupled with testing delays and likely poor rates of adherence with self-isolation, suggests that this system is having a marginal impact on transmission at the moment," they wrote.

"Unless the system grows at the same rate as the epidemic, and support is given to people to enable them to adhere to self-isolation, it is likely that the impact of Test, Trace and Isolate will further decline in the future."

The scheme's success only seems to have worsened since the Sage document was written.

Figures from last week showed NHS Test And Trace in England had suffered its worst week for the proportion of contacts it successfully manages to track down. Only 68.6 per cent of close contacts of individuals who have tested positive for Covid-19 were reached in the week ending September 30, the lowest weekly percentage since the scheme began.

The Sage papers also warn the Government against sending out mixed messages.

A section on “consistency” states: “If policies appear to promote contradictory goals, this will at best confuse the public and at worst degrade trust and adherence. For example, preventing people from meeting a relative at home, while encouraging them to go to pubs or workplaces appears inconsistent.”

Full lockdown would have 'very high impact' on transmission

The Sage papers argued that a full, national lockdown of the kind the Government imposed in March would have a "very high impact" on the level of transmission.

The policy is just one of two Sage says it can confidently predict the outcome of - the other is using no interventions and seeing the virus rip through the population.

The papers estimate the policy would reduce transmission by around 75 per cent, based on a reduction of the R rate from 2.7 to 0.6 after the country was locked down in March.

But the experts also say a full lockdown, with a "stay at home" order issued by Downing Street, would have a "large impact on wellbeing" - including on people with mental health conditions and existing illnesses and on older and BAME people.

The papers recommended Mr Johnson should accompany any national-level lockdown with substantial "financial, social, informational and emotional" support, and allow people to exercise outdoors as they did during the Spring wave of the virus.

The scientists also warn that "harsh enforcement could exacerbate social division and could lead to disorder".

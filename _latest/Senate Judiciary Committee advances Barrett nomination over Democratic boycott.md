<div><p>Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee approved Judge Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s nomination to the Supreme Court on Thursday, sending the nomination to the full Senate despite a boycott from Democrats on the committee.</p><p>Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called it a &#8220;unanimous vote,&#8221; though none of the 10 Democrats were present. In the committee room, Democrats instead put in their chairs large photos of people who benefitted from the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Barrett&#8217;s nomination is expected to move to the full Senate floor as quickly as tomorrow. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to hold a procedural vote on the confirmation Sunday and a final vote on Monday. Republicans are expected to have the votes needed to approve her.</p><p>Democrats boycotted as a sign of protest. They say Barrett&#8217;s nomination is illegitimate because Republicans are refusing to abide by their promise, and their 2016 precedent, to not confirm a justice in an election year. In 2016, the <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/ct-mcconnell-supreme-court-garland-20160320-story.html">Senate refused to consider Merrick Garland</a>, nominated by President Obama almost eight months before the election.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>&#8220;Republicans have moved at breakneck speed to jam through this nominee, ignoring her troubling record and unprecedented evasions, and breaking longstanding committee rules to set tomorrow&#8217;s vote,&#8221; Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee said in a joint statement. &#8220;Fearing a loss at the ballot box, Republicans are showing that they do not care about the rules or what the American people want, but are concerned only with raw political power.&#8221;</p><p>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called it a &#8220;surreal&#8221; for Democrats to boycott an important vote. He compared the pictures Democrats had set up to those that sporting venues have put in their stadiums during games throughout the pandemic.</p><p> &#8220;Rather than show up and do their job, they choose to continue the theater that was part of the hearing,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Democrats on the committee were under mounting pressure from progressives to make a bigger stand against Barrett&#8217;s confirmation. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in particular <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-16/dianne-feinstein-liberal-critics-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-hearing">has been under intense scrutiny by fellow Democrats </a>after praising Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham&#8217;s handling of the nomination, undercutting Democrats&#8217; message. </p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>Progressives argue that allowing the nomination to move under normal business terms lends credence to the Republican effort.</p><p>Democrats&#8217; boycott of the vote threatened to force Republicans to violate the committee&#8217;s quorum requirements, which demand that two members of the minority party be present for votes. But no one challenged the quorum requirement on Thursday.</p></div>

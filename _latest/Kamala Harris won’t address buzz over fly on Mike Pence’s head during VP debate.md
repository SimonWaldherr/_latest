Sen. Kamala Harris refused to address the buzz surrounding the fly that landed on Vice President Mike Pence’s head during their debate.

The Democratic vice presidential nominee tried in vain to fly by questions about the show-stealing insect during an interview on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show.”

“I think it’s important that we kind of find a way to move on, and… fly away from this subject onto something else,” she told Maddow in between laughs.

But Harris did indicate that she was able to spot the black horsefly that sat on Pence’s neatly combed gray hair for 2 minutes and 9 seconds during last week’s debate in Salt Lake City, Utah.

“I would kick myself if I didn’t ask you.. if you noticed the fly on Vice President Pence’s head,” Maddow said.

The California lawmaker let out a chuckle and sighed “Oh, Rachel.”

“We could see it at home, could you see it?” Maddow pushed, to which Harris nodded as she attempted to stifle her laughter.

The host continued to press the buzzy issue, asking whether Harris had wanted to swat the bug away.

Harris chortled before saying it was time to “move on” from the viral moment.

In an interview earlier this week, Pence said he had no clue the fly was there.

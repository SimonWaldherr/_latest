Kanye West is facing the music for his delusional “write-in” presidential bid.

The 43-year-old hip hop star was slammed Friday for encouraging fans to write him in for president on 2020 election ballots, potentially siphoning votes from Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

The billionaire sneaker mogul on Thursday night tweeted a photo of his name penned on a mail-in ballot with the caption “friends writing me in” — sparking outrage from onlookers.

“You used to be talented and wise. Now you are a sad loser,” one critic bashed.

“Are you insane?” another observer Tweeted — as a third fumed, “You’ve become a sad joke, Kanye.”

Activists quickly urged observers to report West, who launched late-entry White House bid as an independent, to Twitter “for attempted voter suppression.”

“A vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump,” another critic slammed.

Democrats fear the hip hop mogul could thwart Biden’s chance at becoming president by funneling votes away from black and swing state voters.

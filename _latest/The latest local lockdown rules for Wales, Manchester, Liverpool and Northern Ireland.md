Boris Johnson has unveiled tough new local lockdowns that will see millions of households banned from mixing with each other indoors and hundreds of pubs in Liverpool shut their doors for four weeks.

The Prime Minister announced the measures, which came into force on October 14, alongside a three-tier Covid alert level system, which will see different parts of the country placed in different categories dependent on rates of infection, with areas in the highest level facing the toughest restrictions.

The first alert level, which is medium, covers most of the country and consists of the current national measures, such as the rule of six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm.

The second alert level, which is high, “reflects the interventions in many local areas at the moment”, the Prime Minister said. This level bans the mixing of households or support bubbles in any indoor setting, however separate households can meet outdoors and in private gardens providing that the rule of six is followed.

Areas already under restrictions will automatically move into the high alert level, and as a result of increasing infection rates, Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move into the high alert level.

According to a list released by Number 10, the Greater Manchester, Warrington, Derbyshire, Lancashire, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, North East, Tees Valley, West Midlands and Leicester areas all fall under Tier 2.

The very high alert level - the most severe on the system - will “apply where transmission rates are rising most rapidly and where the NHS could soon be under unbearable pressure without further restrictions”. In these areas, social mixing indoors and in private gardens will be banned and pubs and bars will be closed.

Just 6.31% of eligible voters turned out in 1792. The elections of 1820, 1789 and 1816 also saw rates below 20%.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But trends changed in the mid-19th century, when the U.S. began to see&#160;"astronomical" turnout,&#160;said Barry Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The high numbers&#160;are partly reflective that suffrage was restricted to mainly white, male property owners," Barry said. "It was also a time of great party polarization. That drew out voters because it seemed as though something was really at stake, and that turns out to be an important driver of turnout generally throughout history."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Think you know everything about women's suffrage?&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/life/women-of-the-century/2020/08/20/19th-amendment-and-suffrage-history-you-need-unlearn/5614889002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Here&#8217;s the history to unlearn</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The U.S. saw&#160;the highest eligible voter turnout rate, 82.6%,&#160;in 1876, when Republican Rutherford Hayes defeated Democrat Samuel Tilden. In 1860, when&#160;Abraham Lincoln defeated John Breckinridge,&#160;John Bell and&#160;Stephen Douglas, 81.8% of eligible voters turned out. The elections of 1868, 1880, 1888 and 1840 also saw rates above 80%.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Importantly, after the Civil War and the passage of the 13th, 14th, 15th Amendments, we saw very high turnout of freed&#160;slaves," said&#160;Bernard&#160;Fraga, an associate professor of political science at Emory University who studies minority voter turnout. "Despite efforts of suppressing the vote of freed men, you still saw a tremendous amount of turnout."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But those&#160;rates fell with the end of Reconstruction, as federal officials withdrew&#160;from Southern states and Jim Crow laws barred newly&#160;enfranchised Black voters. Progressive Era reforms &#8211; including the creation of the secret ballot and&#160;voter registration laws &#8211; "ironically had the effect of decreasing turnout," Barry said. By 1920, rates fell to less than 50%.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Turnout rates continued to fluctuate&#160;throughout the mid-20th century as&#160;women gained the right to vote, Congress passed the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the national voting age became 18 (the voting age had been 21 in most states).&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-elections-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Turnout among those eligible to vote began to decline in 1972 and was in the low 50% range throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The lowest mark in recent history was 1996 with 51.7% of the voter-eligible population participating.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Know your voting rights:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/20/2020-election-voter-rights-polls-trump-biden/3710714001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">What to do if you encounter intimidation at the polls</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The United States makes it relatively difficult to vote compared to other democracies, and we&#8217;ve had relatively low turnout," Fraga said, referencing turnout among the voting age population.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While registered voters in the U.S. turn out at a comparatively high rate, turnout among the voting age population is low partly&#160;because non-citizens &#8211; and people convicted of a felony, depending on the state &#8211; cannot vote.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The U.S. placed 26th out of 32 for turnout rates among the voting age population among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,&#160;according to a&#160;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">2018 Pew Research Center study</a>.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">2008: Highest voter turnout in last 50 years&#160;</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The turnout rate started to rise in 2004 and, in 2008, the U.S. saw the highest rate of eligible voter turnout in a presidential election&#160;in the last 50 years: 61.65%.

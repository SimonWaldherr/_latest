But the Post says many experts believe the 10-day event, which drew hundreds of thousands of bikers, was responsible for many times that number of infections. They say contact tracing often doesn&#8217;t capture the source of an infection, and asymptomatic spread often goes unnoticed. Attendees came from every state, packing&#160; bars, restaurants and tattoo parlors in the area.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Holding a half-million-person rally in the midst of a pandemic is emblematic of a nation as a whole that maybe isn&#8217;t taking (the pandemic) as seriously as we should," Josh Michaud, an epidemiologist and associate director for global health policy for the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, told the Post.&#160;</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a id="gpd-1603031601498"></a>Donald Trump touts his own recovery from COVID-19 in new reelection ad</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">President Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/17/election-2020-trump-touts-his-own-covid-recovery-pitch-seniors/5967676002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">claiming victory over the virus</a> in his reelection campaign ads.

Francis chose to live there permanently after his 2013 election, shunning the Apostolic Palace, because he said he needed to be around ordinary people. The hotel has a communal dining room and chapel where Francis celebrates Mass each morning.&#160;At 83 and with part of a lung removed when he was in his 20s due to illness, the pope would be at high-risk for COVID-19 complications.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-6" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">COVID resources from USA TODAY&#160;</h2><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>In your inbox:</strong> Stay up to date with the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic from the USA TODAY Network. <strong><a href="https://profile.usatoday.com/newsletters/coronavirus-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Sign up for the daily Coronavirus Watch newsletter</a>.&#160;</strong></li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Tips for coping: </strong>Every Saturday and Tuesday we'll be in your inbox, offering you a virtual hug and a little bit of solace in these difficult times. <strong><a href="https://profile.usatoday.com/newsletters/Staying-Apart-Together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Sign up for Staying Apart, Together</a>.</strong></li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>On Facebook: </strong>A lot is still unknown about the coronavirus.

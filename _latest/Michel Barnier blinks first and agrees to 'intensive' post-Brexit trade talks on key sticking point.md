<p>Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove had told MPs that the UK was walking away from Brexit trade talks, saying they would&#160;be "meaningless" without a shift in the EU's stance.</p>
<p>"The conclusions of that council reaffirmed the EU's original negotiating mandate, they dropped a reference to intensive talks that has been in the draft and they declared that all, all future moves in this negotiation had to be made by the UK," he said, adding it was "almost incredible" that the EU had so far refused to discuss legal texts so far.</p>

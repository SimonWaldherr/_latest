Special to USA TODAY

Every election cycle I field the same inquiry from my clients. It goes something like this: Don’t you think stocks will sell off if my candidate loses? My response is always the same: Don’t invest your politics.

While most investors are handicapping the election on a daily basis, savvy investors should be focused on long-term economic trends that are likely to continue no matter which party takes the White House, the kinds of shifts that will have a profound impact for years, even decades, to come.

Here are three trends to consider:

Manufacturing is on the rise

Manufacturing jobs are returning to the U.S., which will drive employment growth, productivity, and corporate margins. Manufacturing jobs create an additional 7.5 jobs, while retail jobs, for example, create 1.2 additional jobs, according to calculations from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While the loss of retail, entertainment and travel-related jobs is tragic, the total impact on the economy will be less dramatic than during the first decade of this century when U.S. manufacturing jobs were being exported to China in droves (experts estimate over 2 million jobs were lost).

Another check?:Here are the top two things Americans want in the next stimulus package

Can't say 'white privilege'?Corporate America demands Trump rescind executive order on diversity

U.S. capital expenditures (capex), the money companies put into plants, technology and equipment, declined dramatically once China joined the World Trade Organization. The correlation is sobering. But once China’s cost advantage began to fade, corporations began to spend again. And that spending was political-party neutral: Capex rose during President Obama’s administration and continued under President Trump. Since then, productivity has been rising. The trend has accelerated and is likely to continue.

Technology will keep driving growth

Corporations are digitizing en masse. Companies as diverse as McDonald’s, Honeywell, Ecolab and Walmart, to name a few, are aggressively digitizing their business models. The trend is accelerating not stalling. Work and shop from home, online banking and payment systems, streaming and gaming, 5G, automobiles full of semiconductors, cloud, data aggregation and cybersecurity — will continue to experience robust demand and sustainable growth.

The digital economy now comprises 9% of GDP. Even more important, “new economy” capex spending (software + tech equipment + Research and development) has exceeded “old economy” spending on structures, industrial and transportation equipment for the first time.

Tech stocks have outperformed for years, leading some experts to compare shares in those companies to those that burst in the tech bubble of 1999-2000. Yet, today’s high multiples are based on trough earnings in an easy monetary policy environment. In 1999, the U.S. central bank was raising interest rates, with the Fed Funds rate hitting 5.5% by the end of 1999. At the height of the bubble, Cisco (CSCO), for example, traded at a multiple well in excess of 130x peak earnings. Today’s multiples, while above average, are nowhere near bubble valuations and are likely to normalize when earnings growth returns in earnest in 2021.

Global growth

The global purchasing manager indices (PMIs) for September continued their optimistic trend with fourteen of 18 regions strengthening and/or expanding. If we are indeed in the early stages of a new expansion, and the monthly numbers indicate that is the case, a typical economic expansion lasts, on average, eight years. Global PMIs, it should be further noted, are highly correlated to corporate profits. Good news for the nascent bull market.

Strap in. The next few months may be turbulent. Elections do, indeed, have consequences but these long-term trends are embedded in the economy and will continue to emerge despite where the political winds blow.

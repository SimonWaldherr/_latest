  'Unprecedented': Voter turnout in election could reach highest rate in more than a century 
description: > 
  Through the first eight days of early voting in Texas, 801,000 people voted in Harris County, eclipsing 93% of the county's 2016 early voting total, with 10 more days of early voting left."We certainly expect that this will be the highest turnout election of all-time here."For the first time in election history, more people are expected to vote early than on Election Day.After the 2018 midterm election, which was the highest midterm turnout since 1914, McDonald predicted the 2020 presidential election could hit the 1908 turnout rate.He said high early voter turnout should ease the length of lines in may states on Election Day.

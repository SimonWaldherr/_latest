<p>Lockdown, the shift to working from home and the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/property-hotspots-stamp-duty-holiday-could-create-biggest-savings/">stamp duty holiday</a> have brought a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/property-hotspots-new-lockdown-restrictions-could-push-house/">summer property surge</a> that has pushed <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/house-prices/asking-prices-larger-homes-hit-record-high-buyers-compete-space/">home values to record highs</a>.</p>
<p>But which <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/postcodes-driving-property-market-mini-boom-ones-left-behind/">micro-markets have been the ultimate winners</a> of the post-pandemic house price boom?</p>
<p>Here, using an exclusive dataset from property website Zoopla, we look at the local authorities&#160;that recorded the biggest year-on-year price jumps in August in each part of England, Wales and Scotland.</p>
<h3>The North</h3>
<p>In the year before the pandemic started, house prices in Greater Manchester were <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/northern-towns-leading-post-coronavirus-property-surge/">growing at the fastest rate in the country</a>. That trend has continued since the market was reopened after lockdown: it&#160;accounted&#160;for six of the 10 local authorities in Britain that recorded the biggest August price jumps, according to Zoopla.&#160;</p>
<p>Oldham,&#160;on the northeastern outskirts of the city, saw the highest rate of growth in the UK, with a 5.2pc year-on-year jump in prices in August.</p>
<p>Neighbouring Rochdale and Tameside came in second and third place with respective jumps of 5.1pc and 4.7pc.</p>
<p>Mark Hadley, of Hunters estate agents, said: &#8220;In August and September the market felt like being on a treadmill and someone kept pressing the speed button &#8211;&#160;it was just getting faster and faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Value for money is key, and means &#8220;investors are fighting first-time buyers,&#8221; said Mr Hadley. Each group&#160;accounts for two in five purchasers.</p>
<p>Many landlords buying here are&#160;from the South,&#160;drawn in by the average 8pc yields and high tenant demand.&#160;Terraced houses that cost &#163;80,000 to &#163;85,000 can earn &#163;650 per month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more first-timers are turning to Oldham's cheaper homes now that lenders require larger deposits for mortgages,&#160;said Mr Hadley.</p>

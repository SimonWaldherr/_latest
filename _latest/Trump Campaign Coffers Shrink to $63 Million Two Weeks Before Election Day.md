Biden Jr., who reported $177.3 million in cash on hand for the final stretch of the campaign.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">New filings with the Federal Election Commission showed the extent of Mr. Trump&#8217;s cash troubles, which are severe enough that he diverted time from key battleground states and flew to California on Sunday for a fund-raiser with just over two weeks until Election Day. The president ended September with just over half as much money as he had at the beginning of the month.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign and its shared committees with the Republican National Committee have raised $1.5 billion since the start of 2019, the disclosures late Tuesday showed that his main re-election committee &#8212; the account that must pay for many of the race&#8217;s most important costs, including most television ads &#8212; had only a small slice remaining.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">All told, Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign and its shared committees with the R.N.C. had $251.4 million entering October, compared with the $432 million that Mr. Biden&#8217;s campaign and its joint accounts with the Democratic National Committee had in the bank. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Fortunes have reversed sharply from this spring, when Mr. Trump and the Republicans <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/politics/biden-2020-fundraising.html" title="">had nearly $190 million more in the bank</a> than Mr. Biden and the Democrats did when he emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Now, entering October, Mr. Biden had close to triple as much of the most flexible campaign dollars as the president.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The Trump campaign has all the resources we need going into the homestretch of this election,&#8221; said Samantha Zager, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She added, &#8220;As Hillary Clinton proved when she outspent us two to one in 2016, no amount of money can buy the presidency.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Speaking in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump tried to excuse the state of his fund-raising operation. &#8220;I could be the king of all fund-raisers,&#8221; claimed Mr. Trump, whose campaign has aggressively pursued large contributors, saying he simply did not want to &#8220;owe them.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats took glee at the diminished size of a war chest that Mr. Trump&#8217;s former campaign manager once compared to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1258388669544759296?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Death Star from &#8220;Star Wars.&#8221;</a> The campaign arm of House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, issued a news release with the subject line &#8220;DCCC Has More COH Than Trump Campaign,&#8221; referring to cash on hand.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shane-goldmacher" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Shane Goldmacher</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rachel-shorey" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-says-before-coronavirus-he-never-planned-on-campaigning-in-erie-pa-we-had-this-thing-won"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-says-before-coronavirus-he-never-planned-on-campaigning-in-erie-pa-we-had-this-thing-won">Trump says before coronavirus he never planned on campaigning in Erie, Pa. &#8216;We had this thing won.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="President Trump at his campaign rally at Erie International Airport in Erie, Pa., on Tuesday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/us/politics/20elections-brief-erie4/merlin_178815651_3caa7bfe-b39c-4c16-8b44-6bcff21bb2cf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">President Trump at his campaign rally at Erie International Airport in Erie, Pa., on Tuesday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Doug Mills/The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump falsely insisted on Tuesday that the United States is &#8220;rounding the turn on the pandemic&#8221; and distorted Joseph R.

In what Mr. Trump said was a first for one of his campaign rallies, he played on large video screens a montage of several clips in which Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, talked about phasing out fossil fuels to combat climate change.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If Biden is elected, he will wipe out your energy industry,&#8221; Mr. Trump said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also offered a litany of false claims about Mr. Biden&#8217;s position on the coronavirus, saying that the former vice president would &#8220;delay therapies, postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, shut down our country.&#8221; But his claim that under his own leadership, the country was &#8220;rounding the turn&#8221; on the pandemic was sharply at odds with the reality that the virus was surging both nationally and in Pennsylvania, where <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/pennsylvania-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">cases are at a level the state has not seen since April.</a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by an average of 7 percentage points in the state, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/presidential-polls-trump-biden?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-elections-2020&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;context=storyline_menu_recirc" title="">according to the Upshot&#8217;s calculator.</a> Mr. Trump, seeming to acknowledge that deficit, pined for the days earlier this year when his electoral standing looked brighter.

Zeidler Municipal Building in downtown Milwaukee by 7:30 a.m., as crowds waited for more than two hours to cast their ballots on the first day of early voting in Wisconsin.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Jon Berlin, 70, a psychiatrist, arrived with his partner, Susan Hrlevich, 60, at 5:20 a.m. The pair, who are independent voters, wore parkas and brought folding canvas chairs as they walked from their downtown residence to cast votes for Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">They said they feared even longer lines &#8212; and exposure to the coronavirus &#8212; if they had waited until Nov. 3 to vote.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel safe in this country for the first time,&#8221; said Mr. Berlin. &#8220;We have this horrible pandemic and we need a leader who can face the truth and tell the truth.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Early voting has drawn crowds around the nation, and both campaigns are seeking to turn out their supporters. Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden&#8217;s running mate, planned to participate in a virtual Milwaukee rally with Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and several local officials to encourage early voting there.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Chrystal Gillon-Mabry, a 68-year-old artist, and her sister, Coral Hegwood, 59, a retired city employee, brought books to read and chairs when they arrived before 5:30 a.m.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Hegwood said that she was still undecided as she stood in line. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to vote for Trump, but I don&#8217;t want to compromise my Christian beliefs,&#8221; she said. Afterward, she said she had voted for Mr. Biden. &#8220;I prayed and prayed on it,&#8221; she said, concluding that &#8220;Biden has more compassion than Trump &#8212; he has no compassion or empathy for anybody.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Before in-person early voting began Tuesday, more than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://elections.wi.gov/node/7192" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">915,000 Wisconsinites had voted</a> since officials began mailing absentee ballots Sept. 17, a figure that amounts to about 30 percent of the state&#8217;s total vote in 2016. The turnout has been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/us/elections/absentee-voting-in-several-key-states-is-favoring-democrats.html" title="">far higher in the state&#8217;s traditionally Democratic strongholds</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dane County, which includes Madison and is by far the state&#8217;s most Democratic county, has had turnout already that amounts to close to half the votes cast there four years ago. No other county&#8217;s turnout eclipsed more than 37 percent of its 2016 numbers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While Wisconsin Democrats have encouraged voters to cast ballots as soon as they are able, the state&#8217;s Republican Party urged supporters to wait until early voting began. &#8220;Avoid the long lines on Election Day,&#8221; read a flyer the Republican Party of Wisconsin mailed to supporters last week, urging them to make plans to vote early, which the state describes as voting &#8220;absentee&#8221; in person. The mailing made no mention of voting by mail.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Denise Williams, 67, who uses a walker and has been staying mostly at home since the pandemic, was glad to socialize &#8212; from at least a few feet apart &#8212; with fellow voters, all of whom wore masks. She arrived at 6 a.m. and waited almost three hours.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Our country is too divided, I want it back together again,&#8221; said Ms. Williams, a retired nursing assistant who voted for Mr. Biden. She would have voted by mail, she said, but she never received a ballot. &#8220;I wanted to make sure my vote got in, and with my health, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll be on Election Day.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  Kay Nolan and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/reid-j-epstein" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="michigan-and-pennsylvania-say-they-can-finish-counting-ballots-within-three-days-of-the-election"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#michigan-and-pennsylvania-say-they-can-finish-counting-ballots-within-three-days-of-the-election">Michigan and Pennsylvania say they can finish counting ballots within three days of the election.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Pennsylvania voters requested nearly 3 million ballots and have returned just over 1 million of them.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The top election officials in Michigan and Pennsylvania, two battleground states where many fear that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/politics/how-prepared-are-these-7-battlegrounds-for-the-election-a-readiness-report.html" title="">an avalanche of mail ballots could significantly delay the reporting</a> of election results next month, said Tuesday that they hope to finish counting nearly every ballot within three days of Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Secretaries of state Jocelyn Benson of Michigan and Kathy Boockvar of Pennsylvania said election officials in both of their states have made sweeping preparations to process absentee ballots quickly, even though they will have to begin their tabulations long after many other states.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Benson said Michigan had doubled or tripled the number of high-speed ballot-processing machines in counties with large numbers of absentee voters and had recruited 30,000 workers to verify and count them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Pennsylvania, Ms. Boockvar said, outside experts had helped state and local election officials &#8220;figure out what was most important and where we could eliminate bottlenecks&#8221; in the tabulations. Workers in more populous counties will be counting around the clock until tabulations are largely complete; a handful of ballots, like those from voters living abroad, are counted later.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;All the counties have really upped their game,&#8221; she said. &#8220;By Friday, I expect the overwhelming majority of ballots will be counted in Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The two secretaries, both Democrats, spoke with Secretary of State Frank LaRose of Ohio, a Republican, at a seminar held by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Their pledges appeared aimed in part at addressing concerns that prolonged tabulations in the two states would raise public concerns about election fraud that could be exploited by losing candidates. President Trump has repeatedly said that he could lose only if the presidential election were rigged, and has claimed without evidence that voting by mail is riddled with fraud.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Pennsylvania and Michigan are perhaps the two most hotly contested states where delays in tabulating absentees votes have seemed likely to be significant. In Pennsylvania, where voters requested <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/PA.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 3 million ballots and have returned just over 1 million </a>of them according to the United States Elections Project, workers cannot even open ballots until the polls have closed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Michigan voters have already sent in almost 1.7 million of the nearly 3 million absentee ballots they have requested, but state law only allows election workers to begin opening and verifying mail ballots &#8212; but not tabulating them &#8212; on the day before Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ohioans also are voting by mail in record numbers and have already returned half of the 2.4 million ballots they have requested. But the state&#8217;s tabulation rules, which allow counties to process absentee ballots as they arrive, make it likely that some absentee results will be posted even before in-person ballots are counted, Mr. LaRose said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">All three officials said they had taken steps to ensure that their vote counts were as transparent as possible to debunk claims of fraud. Ohio will revise election night reports to highlight the number of absentee ballots that remain to be counted, Mr. LaRose said.

He spent a decade unsuccessfully pursuing projects in China, operating an office there during his first run for president and forging a partnership with a major government-controlled company.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And it turns out that China is one of only three foreign nations &#8212; the others are Britain and Ireland &#8212; where Mr. Trump maintains a bank account, according to an analysis of the president&#8217;s tax records, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html" title="">which were obtained by The New York Times</a>.

He said the company had opened the account after establishing an office in China &#8220;to explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialized and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,&#8221; Mr. Garten said. &#8220;Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Garten would not identify the bank in China where the account is held.

His campaign has tried to portray Mr. Biden as a &#8220;puppet&#8221; of China who, as vice president, misread the dangers posed by its growing power. Mr. Trump has also sought to tar his opponent with overblown or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/us/politics/hunter-biden-china.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share" title="">unsubstantiated assertions</a> about Hunter Biden&#8217;s business dealings there while his father was in office.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As for the former vice president, his public financial disclosures, along with the income tax returns he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://joebiden.com/financial-disclosure/#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voluntarily released</a>, show no income or business dealings of his own in China.

Hours later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he was considering posting the interview with Ms. Stahl &#8220;PRIOR TO AIRTIME!&#8221; He described it as a &#8220;terrible Electoral Intrusion&#8221; and suggested that his Democratic opponent, Joseph R.

A day earlier, Mr. Trump repeatedly called his opponent &#8220;a criminal,&#8221; using the same word for a reporter he chided for not focusing on the Post story. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president has repeatedly called on Mr. Barr to intervene in issues since he was confirmed by the Senate. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"> Mr. Biden is leading or tied with Mr. Trump in nearly every public poll in the battleground states that handed Mr. Trump his 2016 victory.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has significantly cut into Mr. Trump&#8217;s edge on issues like the economy, and the president&#8217;s poor performance in handling the pandemic has brought his poll numbers down. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president made the comments during an interview in which his answers were studded with lies and falsehoods about a range of issues, and in which he criticized the Bidens, the news media and the infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony S. Fauci.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After spending Monday attacking Dr. Fauci, who remains popular in public opinion polls, Mr. Trump claimed Tuesday he was &#8220;not at odds&#8221; with him, before renewing the attacks. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president falsely described Dr. Fauci as a &#8220;Democrat,&#8221; and claimed he was a &#8220;good friend&#8221; of the family of Gov.

But on Monday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took a novel approach: She asked her nine million Twitter followers to watch her play a video game.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Anyone want to play Among Us with me on Twitch to get out the vote?&#8221; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1318276809977434112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1318277832401997830%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_0&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.latimes.com%2Fentertainment-arts%2Fstory%2F2020-10-20%2Faoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-twitch-among-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Monday afternoon, referring to the popular livestreaming platform. She added that she had never played it &#8220;but it looks like a lot of fun.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Among Us is a cartoony game in which players try to stay alive on an alien spaceship.

Major streamers, YouTube stars and TikTok influencers now play it for millions of fans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Monday night, more than 300,000 users went online to watch Ms. Ocasio-Cortez play Among Us with a handful of popular streamers. It was another illustration of how Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has a degree of internet literacy that was not seen in Congress before she entered politics.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As Ms. Ocasio-Cortez&#8217;s pink &#8220;aoc&#8221; avatar bounced around the spaceship, a video beneath the action showed the headphone-clad congresswoman smiling as she played &#8212; and occasionally gasping when her avatar ran into trouble.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Ocasio-Cortez talked a little about politics &#8212; including health care and transgender rights &#8212; and the presidential election. She said that she planned to vote in person, rather than by mail, because she wanted her vote counted on Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I&#8217;m so excited by this upcoming election,&#8221; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez added a few minutes later. &#8220;We can overwhelm the polls, and we can get things back on track.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For the most part, though, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was absorbed in the game itself, and the spaceship where her avatar was competing. At one point she observed that some of its features seemed anachronistic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;What kind of futuristic spaceship still runs a combustion engine?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I mean, really?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-ives" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid6">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid6-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid6"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid6"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="new-ads-put-poll-workers-at-center-stage-to-shore-up-faith-in-voting-system"></p><p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70">Ad Watch</p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#new-ads-put-poll-workers-at-center-stage-to-shore-up-faith-in-voting-system">New ads put poll workers at center stage to shore up faith in voting system.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A series of ads featuring poll workers and election officials begins airing Tuesday, meant to assure Americans that the voting process is safe and secure.

The situation has improved since April, when the state&#8217;s unemployment rate hit 16.1 percent. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But to answer one of the most basic questions of a re-election campaign &#8212; are you better off today than you were four years ago? &#8212; unemployment in the state is higher than it was in September 2016, when it stood at 5.4 percent.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-cooper" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="pelosi-and-mnuchin-are-racing-against-a-tuesday-deadline-for-a-new-stimulus-deal"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#pelosi-and-mnuchin-are-racing-against-a-tuesday-deadline-for-a-new-stimulus-deal">Pelosi and Mnuchin are racing against a Tuesday deadline for a new stimulus deal.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continues to talk about a stimulus plan with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.&#160;" class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/us/politics/20elections-brief-pelosi/20elections-brief-pelosi-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continues to talk about a stimulus plan with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.&#160;</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Erin Scott for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California is racing against a self-imposed Tuesday deadline for a compromise with congressional Republicans on a coronavirus stimulus package that could be considered before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, held their latest talks on Monday afternoon, speaking for nearly an hour by phone. The two &#8220;continued to narrow their differences,&#8221; said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi. He added that &#8220;the speaker continues to hope that, by the end of the day Tuesday, we will have clarity on whether we will be able to pass a bill before the election.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The odds of a last-minute deal remain long, with Democrats and the Trump administration still haggling over funding levels and policy issues. Even if they could agree, Senate Republicans have all but ruled out embracing a plan anywhere near as large as the more than $2 trillion package under discussion.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">If such a deal were struck, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the chamber would consider it, but he also made a point of scheduling two separate votes in the coming days on narrower bills of the kind senators in his party are more willing to accept. One would revive a lapsed federal loan program for small businesses and the other would provide $500 billion for schools, testing and expired unemployment benefits.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump has insisted in recent days that he wants to spend more than the $2.4 trillion Ms. Pelosi has put forward in negotiations, and claimed he could easily cajole enough Senate Republicans into supporting an agreement of that size &#8212; a notion that many of them have told his top deputies would never happen.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a private call with Democrats on Monday, Ms. Pelosi instructed committee chairmen to work with the top Republicans on their panels to try to resolve critical differences holding up the deal. She outlined a number of remaining areas of disagreement, including Democratic demands for hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for state and local governments, support for restaurants devastated by the pandemic and additional health provisions, according to a person on the call, who disclosed the details on condition of anonymity. Democrats also remain wary that the administration would spend the funds as Congress intended.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Ms. Pelosi insisted she was optimistic a bargain could be reached and said she was intent on reaching one before a new Democratic administration began in January.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to carry over the droppings of this grotesque elephant into the next presidency,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi told her members. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get something big, and we&#8217;ve got to get it done soon and we&#8217;ve got to get it done right.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p></div>

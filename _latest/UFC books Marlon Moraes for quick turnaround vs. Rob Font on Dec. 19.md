<div><p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/marlon-moraes">Marlon Moraes</a> is wasting no time returning to the cage after his recent loss to Cory Sandhagen.</p>
<p>A former UFC bantamweight title challenger, Moraes (23-7-1 MMA, 5-3 UFC) will attempt to get back into the win column against <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/rob-font">Rob Font</a> on Dec. 19 at an event expected to take place at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Multiple sources confirmed the booking to MMA Junkie on Wednesday but asked to remain anonymous since the promotion has yet to make an official announcement. MMA reporter Mike Russell first <a href="https://twitter.com/MIKERUSSELLMMA/status/1318624655826178048?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> the matchup as being targeted in a tweet Tuesday.</p>
 
<p>Moraes competed against Sandhagen earlier this month at UFC on ESPN+ 37. He was finished with a spinning wheel kick and punches in Round 2. The loss was Moraes&#8217; second in as many fights but the first time he&#8217;s been finished since 2011.</p>
<p>Font (17-4 MMA, 7-3 UFC) will compete in his first fight since tearing his ACL in a December 2019 unanimous decision win over Ricky Simon. Coming into the matchup, Font rides a two-fight winning streak and has lost only once since late 2017.</p>
<p>With the addition, the Dec. 19 lineup includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sean Brady vs. Belal Muhammad</li>
<li>Antonio Braga Neto vs. Deron Winn</li>
<li>Tafon Nchukwi vs. Jamie Pickett</li>
<li>Rob Font vs. Marlon Moraes</li>
</ul>

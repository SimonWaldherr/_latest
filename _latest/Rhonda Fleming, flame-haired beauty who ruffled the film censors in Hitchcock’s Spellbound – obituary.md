<div><p>In 1966 she retired from acting following her fourth marriage, to the producer Hall Bartlett. But before long the couple were estranged from each other. They divided up the rooms of their Los Angeles home and established a rota for use of the kitchen and swimming pool, before finally agreeing upon a divorce in 1972.</p>
<p>Rhonda soon discovered that Hollywood loyalties were fleeting. After six years away from the industry, she struggled to find work, and turned instead to Broadway, making her stage debut in the 1973 revival of Clare Boothe Luce&#8217;s The Women. Her film career never regained its former momentum, and she was mainly remembered, albeit fondly, as a relic of Hollywood&#8217;s golden era, an impression given further credence in one of her few roles of the period, a cameo as &#8220;Rhoda Flaming&#8221; in Michael Winner&#8217;s 1976 spoof Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood.</p>
<p>In 1990, following the death of her sister Beverly from ovarian cancer, Rhonda Fleming retired for good. She dedicated her remaining years to charitable pursuits, with a particular focus on cancer research. The Rhonda Fleming Mann Clinic for Women&#8217;s Comprehensive Care opened at the UCLA Medical Center in 1991. A second facility followed three years later, the Rhonda Fleming Mann Resource Center for Women with Cancer, dedicated to providing support and information for families affected by the illness.</p>
<p>Intensely religious from the age of 18, Rhonda was a close associate of Media Fellowship International, an organisation dedicated to nurturing Christian values in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Rhonda Fleming married, first, in 1940, to Thomas Lane, an interior decorator. The marriage was dissolved and in 1952, she married, secondly, Dr Lew Morrell. They divorced in 1958, and she married the actor Lang Jeffries two years later. Her fourth marriage, to Hall Bartlett, was dissolved in 1972. In 1978 she married the producer Ted Mann. He died in 2001, and in 2003 she married Darol Wayne Carlson, who died in 2017. She is survived by a son from her first marriage.</p>

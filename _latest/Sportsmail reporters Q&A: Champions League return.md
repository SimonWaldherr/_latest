I&#8217;m looking at RB Salzburg striker Patson Daka and Rennes&#8217;s Jeremy Doku as potential breakout stars. Daka has a near goal-a-start record for the Austrians while Doku is just 18 but Rennes decided to splash out &#163;25m to sign him from Anderlecht this summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who are the underdog team to keep an eye on and which big club could face a group stage exit?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both made the latter stages in Portugal last season but won&#8217;t be among the favourites &#8211; free-scoring Atalanta and German league leaders RB Leipzig.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Can see United finding themselves in the Europa League after the group stages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">COVID chaos or a smoothly-completed competition again &#8211; which will it be?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Smoothly completed competition.

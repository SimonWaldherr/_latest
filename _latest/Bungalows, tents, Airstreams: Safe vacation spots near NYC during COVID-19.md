Up for a vacation this autumn? We could use about 20.

But amid this socially distant reality, there’s a whole new slew of concerns you have to keep in mind when booking travel.

Happily, there’s no shortage of options that fit the bill for safer travel, from the recently opened Roundtree in Amagansett, boasting exterior entrances and accommodations fanned out over two acres to the secluded Grove Lodge, the newest accommodation at Mohonk Mountain House, a family-friendly resort in the Hudson Valley (pack your hiking boots).

For more inspiration, these road-trippable spots — for a variety of selling points — make it easy to stress less, savor more.

Live out your HGTV dreams in South Cairo, New York

They had us at tiny homes. But in case you need more convincing to head to any of Think big! A Tiny Home Resort‘s eight impeccably furnished petite digs: This sanctuary is located on 37 acres of land — with at least an acre between each abode — just two hours from Manhattan. Perched on a cliff overlooking the Catskill Creek, grab a book from the library for a blissful al fresco reading session or blow off all your quaran-steam with kayaking, a stroll with the on-site goats or a round of outdoor games. (Indoorsy types, there’s wifi and cable, too). FYI: They’re mostly booked for August, so book your September holiday pronto.

From $250/night

Glamp in a private tent in Waymart, Pennsylvania

If nature, angling and lazing in a boat on a 90-acre spring-fed mountain lake sounds up your alley, you’ll love family-friendly Keen Lake Camping and Cottage Resort. Located in the Pocono Mountains two-and-a-half hours from NYC, there are vacation home rentals, RVs and more, but we’re partial to the glamping tents on elevated platforms. Outside your tent you’ll have a grassy area to unwind, complete with a firepit and gas grill for firing up all those frozen veggie burgers you panic ordered in March. Don’t care about the safari-style tents? For $43 a night (for two people) grab a no-frills campsite, or for $78 per night splurge for a lakefront view, electric and sewer site.

From $149/night for glamping, $174/night for lakefront glamping

Book a treetop lodge in Kennebunkport, Maine

Toasting a special occasion? Post up at Hidden Pond, a chichi boutique property featuring a collection of individually-standing cottages, bungalows and, new for July, treetop lodges, spread out across 60 acres of mystical birch forest. All have been converted into rentals for 2020. Before you arrive, the staff can stock your room with F&B, extra towels, tie-dye kits and whatever you need to start your vacation on an excellent note. From there, grab a bike and golf cart to explore the property, scope out pristine nature trails, pick your own flowers from “The Farm” or enjoy water activities at the nearby beach. When hunger strikes, superb on-site restaurant Earth offers private dining sheds for small groups or get a dining basket delivered to your room to indulge in from the comfort of your private porch. All this and more a five-hour drive from New York City.

From $650/night

Retreat to an airstream trailer in Amenia, New York

Hidden away about 90 miles from Manhattan in Dutchess County, Hotel Caravana is located at the Four Brothers Drive In, which plays double features nightly. The groovily-outfitted 1984 31-foot vintage Airstream sleeps up to six. There’s also a patio deck, firepit, hammock and plenty of lawn games. When you’re not nursing a flask and watching flicks, grab a loaner bike and hit the Harlem Valley Rail Trail. For solo travelers or pairs on a budget, you can also book a campsite on the sprawling 16-acre grounds for a mere $40 a night.

From $369/night

Avoid bumping into anyone in Port Jervis, New York

Decamp to the land of the Neversink and the Delaware rivers, thanks to Cedar Lakes Estate‘s bucolic setting and lush vistas (a welcome reprieve from, you know, your computer screen and fire escape). A 90-minute jaunt from The Big Apple, these 18 lavish cottages are situated on a 500-acre site. The resort does a damn good job of making your socially distanced stay fun: think mountaintop yoga, a private picnic on the great lawn, renting a canoe on the lake and roasting s’mores at your firepit. Head home rejuvenated and with a delectable stash of homemade pastries, fresh produce, wildflower bouquets and other provisions from the twice weekly farmer’s market (included with your resort fee) en tote.

From $2,100 for a weeklong, all-inclusive stay (plus $125 daily resort fee per person for all meals, drinks and activities)

A hotel with outdoor hallways in Greenport, New York

Venture about 100 miles from midtown Manhattan to Sound View Greenpoint‘s idyllic slice of Long Island, and settle in to vacation mode at the Low Tide Beach Bar — furniture spaced appropriately — clutching a Death & Co. cocktail and soaking up the melodious rhythms of live bands (remember that?). Located on a quarter-mile of private beach on the Long Island Sound, the property unveiled a new collection of residential-style one and two bedroom suites, each with its own outdoor deck. Social distancing never looked chicer.

From $365/night

Book a bungalow in the Westhampton Beach, New York

Some folks are anxious about traveling. But the setup at the Beach and Bay Bungaglows in Westhampton Beach leaves visitors blissfully worry-free. Under new ownership as of this spring, each of eight sweet houses has been renovated with new furnishings and full kitchens, plus a deck with a grill apiece. (The setup is especially nice for those nervous about restaurants.) Its barrier island location means guests can paddleboard or kayak on the calm Moriches Bay side and catch waves across the road in the Atlantic Ocean. —Hana R. Alberts

From $270/night

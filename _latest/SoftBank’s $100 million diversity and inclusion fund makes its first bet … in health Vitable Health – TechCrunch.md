<div><p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank&#8217;s Opportunity Growth Fund has made the health insurance startup <a href="https://www.vitablehealth.com">Vitable Health</a> the first commitment from its $100 million fund dedicated to investing in startups founded by entrepreneurs of color.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/y-combinators-vitable-health-is-bringing-basic-healthcare-to-underserved-populations/">which recently launched from Y Combinator</a>, is focused on bringing basic health insurance to underserved and low-income communities.</p>
<p>Founded by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/joseph-kitonga" target="_blank">Joseph Kitonga, </a> a&#160;23 year-old entrepreneur whose parents immigrated to the U.S. a decade ago, Vitable provides affordable acute healthcare coverage to underinsured or un-insured populations and was born out of Kitonga&#8217;s experience watching employees of his parents&#8217; home healthcare agency struggle to receive basic coverage.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>The $1.5 million commitment was led by the SoftBank Group Corp Opportunity Fund, and included <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank">Y Combinator, </a> DNA Capital, Commerce Ventures, MSA Capital, Coughdrop Capital, and angels like Immad Akhund, the chief executive of Mercury Bank; and Allison Pickens, the former chief operating officer of Gainsight, <a href="https://vitablehealth.com/blog?p=vitable-s-next-chapter-we-raised-1-6m-to-bridge-the-gaps-in-today-s-healthcare">the company said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good healthcare is a basic right that every American deserves, whoever they are,&#8221; said Paul Judge, the Atlanta-based Early Stage Investing Lead for the fund and the founder of Atlanta&#8217;s TechSquare Labs investment fund. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been inspired by Joseph and his approach to addressing this challenge. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vitable-health" target="_blank">Vitable Health </a> is bridging critical gaps in patient care and has emerged as a necessary, essential service for all whether they&#8217;re uninsured, underinsured, or simply need a better plan for their lifestyle.&#8221;</p>
<p>SoftBank created the opportunity fund while cities around the U.S. were witnessing a wave of public protests against systemic racism and police brutality stemming from the murder of the Black Minneapolis citizen George Floyd at the hands of white police officers.&#160; Floyd&#8217;s murder reignited simmering tensions between citizens and police in cities around the country over issues including police brutality, the militarization of civil authorities, and racial profiling.</p>
<p>SoftBank has had its own problems with racism in its portfolio this year. A few months before the firm launched its fund, the CEO and founder of one of its portfolio companies, Banjo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/banjos-ceo-resigns-cto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resigned</a> after it was revealed that he once had ties to the KKK.</p>
<p>With the Opportunity Fund, SoftBank is trying to address some of its issues, and notably, will not take a traditional management fee for transactions out of the fund &#8220;but instead will seek to put as much capital as possible into the hands of founders and entrepreneurs of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Opportunity Fund is the third investment vehicle announced by SoftBank in the last several years. The biggest of them all is the&#160;<a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=softbank+vision+fund&amp;wm=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 billion Vision Fund</a>; then last year it announced the $2 billion&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-the-innovation-fund-committing-2b-to-invest-in-latin-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Innovation Fund</a>&#160;focused on Latin America.</p>

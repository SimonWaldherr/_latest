  Republicans Advance Barrett’s Supreme Court Nomination Over Democratic Boycott 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday voted to advance President Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, with majority Republicans skirting the panel’s rules to recommend her confirmation as Democrats boycotted the session in protest.If all goes according to plan, Mr. Trump and his party would win a coveted achievement just eight days before the election.“This is why we all run,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the committee, said.“It’s moments like this that make everything you go through matter.”Democrats, livid over the extraordinarily speedy process, spurned the committee vote altogether and forced Republicans to break their own rules to muscle through the nomination.Without the votes to block the judge in either the committee or the full Senate, though, their action was purely symbolic.

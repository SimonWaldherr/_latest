​Donald Trump is no longer at risk of transmitting coronavirus, the White House doctor said on Saturday night.

The diagnosis comes as the US President prepares to resume campaign rallies and other activities.

Dr Sean Conley said Mr Trump meets the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for safely discontinuing isolation and that by "currently recognised standards" he is no longer considered a transmission risk.

The memo did not declare Mr Trump as testing negative for the virus. But sensitive lab tests - like the PCR test - detect the virus in swab samples taken from the nose and throat.

The memo followed Mr Trump's first public appearance since returning to the White House after being treated for coronavirus.

Mr Trump took off his mask moments after he emerged on the White House balcony to address the crowd on the lawn below.

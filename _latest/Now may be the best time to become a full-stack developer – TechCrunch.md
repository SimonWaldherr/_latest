<div><p id="speakable-summary">In the world of software development, one term you&#8217;re sure to hear a lot of is full-stack development. Job recruiters are constantly posting open positions for full-stack developers and the industry is abuzz with this in-demand title.</p>
<p>But what does full-stack actually mean?</p>
<p>Simply put, it&#8217;s the development on the client-side (front end) and the server-side (back end) of software. Full-stack developers are jacks of all trades as they work with the design aspect of software the client interacts with as well as the coding and structuring of the server end.</p>
<p>In a time when technological requirements are rapidly evolving and companies may not be able to afford a full team of developers, software developers that know both the front end and back end are essential.</p>
<p>In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the ability to do full-stack development can make engineers extremely marketable as companies across all industries migrate their businesses to a virtual world. Those who can quickly develop and deliver software projects thanks to full-stack methods have the best shot to be at the top of a company&#8217;s or client&#8217;s wish list.</p>
<h2>Becoming a full-stack developer</h2>
<p>So how can you become a full-stack engineer and what are the expectations? In most working environments, you won&#8217;t be expected to have absolute expertise on every single platform or language. However, it will be presumed that you know enough to understand and can solve problems on both ends of software development.</p>
<p>Most commonly, full-stack developers are familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and back-end languages like Ruby, PHP, or Python. This matches up with the expectations of new hires as well, as you&#8217;ll notice a lot of openings for full-stack developer jobs require specialization in more than one back-end program.</p>
<p>Full-stack is becoming the default way to develop, so much so that some in the software engineering community argue whether or not the term is redundant. As the lines between the front end and back end blur with evolving tech, developers are now being expected to work more frequently on all aspects of the software. However, developers will likely have one specialty where they excel while being good in other areas and a novice at some things&#8230;.and that&#8217;s OK.</p>
<p>Getting into full-stack though means you should concentrate on finding your niche within the particular front-end and back-end programs you want to work with. One practical and common approach is to learn JavaScript since it covers both front and back end capabilities. You&#8217;ll also want to get comfortable with databases, version control, and security. In addition, it&#8217;s smart to prioritize design since you&#8217;ll be working on the client-facing side of things.</p>
<p>Since full-stack developers can communicate with each side of a development team, they&#8217;re invaluable to saving time and avoiding confusion on a project.</p>
<p>One common argument against full stack is that, in theory, developers who can do everything may not do one thing at an expert level. But there&#8217;s no hard or fast rule saying you can&#8217;t be a master at coding and also learn front-end techniques or vice versa.</p>
<h2>Choosing between full-stack and DevOps</h2>
<p>One hold up you may have before diving into full-stack is you&#8217;re also mulling over the option to become a DevOps engineer. There are certainly similarities among both professions, including good salaries and the ultimate goal of producing software as quickly as possible without errors.&#160; As with full-stack developers, DevOps engineers are also becoming more in demand because of the flexibility they offer a company.</p><p class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></p>			</div>

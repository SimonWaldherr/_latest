  Ting Shen/Xinhua/Getty ImagesWhile Democrats and the White House push forward with stimulus talks, Goldman Sachs still doesn't expect a near-term breakthrough.The election is the biggest variable for determining the size of a fiscal relief bill and when it passes, Goldman said.The White House recently upped its proposal to $1.88 billion, but the sum still stands well below the $2.2 trillion package pushed by House Democrats.Time is running out for a pre-election breakthrough, making the election's outcome "the biggest variable" for how stimulus talks will proceed, according to the bank.A fully Democrat-controlled government could expedite a much larger fiscal relief bill, Goldman said.

<p>Senate Democrats already blocked Republicans' bill for renewed Paycheck Protection Program funding on Tuesday, and are poised to vote against a $500 billion "skinny bill" on Wednesday. With neither party making significant strides to meet the other, progress toward reaching a compromise has been sluggish.</p><p>Still, talks will likely continue since "neither side benefits from ending them," Goldman's strategists said. Pelosi said Tuesday she remains "optimistic" about a deal, but has previously indicated that a bill may not materialize until after November 3.</p><p>Time is running out for a pre-election breakthrough, making the election's outcome "the biggest variable" for how stimulus talks will proceed, according to the bank. A status quo result would likely extend the legislative deadlock into the winter and see a bill pass in a lame-duck session of Congress, the team said.</p><p>A Democratic sweep of the White House and the Senate would push a deal into 2021, as Republicans would maintain their objection to a larger deal and Democrats would simply wait to take power. A fully Democrat-controlled government could expedite a much larger fiscal relief bill, Goldman said.</p><p>The strategists still see hope for piecemeal bills being passed before the new year. While Democrats have mostly opposed the approach, lawmakers may seek to renew expanded unemployment benefits before they expire in 2021, the team said. &#13;

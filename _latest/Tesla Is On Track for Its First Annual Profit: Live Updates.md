Sales in China slipped in September, despite price cuts.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Aly Song/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla on Wednesday is expected to report a profit for the fifth consecutive quarter, putting it on track to report its only annual profit since its founding in 2003.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the company will also face questions about whether the strong sales growth it has enjoyed over the last few years is tapering off.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Analysts believe Tesla&#8217;s sales in the United States have already slowed, and they have said it may be suffering from sluggishness in other parts of the world. In China, Tesla has cut prices several times this year and sales of the Model 3 sedans it makes in Shanghai declined slightly in September compared with August and July. In Europe, the company faces growing competition from traditional automakers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Tesla is losing ground in Europe to fierce competitors&#8221; that have offered more affordable electric models, Vicki Bryan, the chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said in a report. Ms. Bryan also said Tesla&#8217;s Model Y hatchback seemed to be taking sales away from the Model 3 rather than adding to the company&#8217;s sales.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla said this month that it delivered 139,000 cars in the third quarter. That was about a 50 percent increase from the second quarter, when sales and production were severely hampered by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The company&#8217;s chief executive, Elon Musk, last month appeared to temper expectations when he forecast that sales would rise 30 to 40 percent this year, implying a range of 482,000 to 514,000 cars.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla would have to sell 182,000 cars in the fourth quarter to sell more than 500,000 cars for the year. Most analysts expect sales for the full year to fall short of that mark, however. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company delivered 112,000 cars.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Analysts expect Tesla to report earnings of 55 cents a share for the third quarter, according to a consensus compiled by FactSet. The company earned 50 cents a share in the second quarter, and 78 cents a share in the third quarter of last year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla&#8217;s profits have often been helped by the sale of credits to other automakers who need them to meet environmental regulations. In the second quarter, the company reported $428 million in credit revenue.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While several automakers have introduced electric vehicles, Tesla so far has faced little serious competition. But that could change over the next year or so.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Tuesday evening, General Motors offered a preview of a battery-powered and technology-packed Hummer pickup truck that it plans to begin selling in about 12 months. The Hummer EV is supposed to go 350 miles or more on a single charge &#8212; in line with Tesla&#8217;s top models. Cameras embedded all around the truck allow drivers 18 different views of where the vehicle is going and what it is driving over. All four wheels will have the ability to turn, allowing it to drive diagonally, a feature G.M. is calling &#8220;Crabwalk.&#8221; G.M. promises the truck will be able to charge enough to travel 100 miles in just 10 minutes.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The first edition will start at $112,595. Other editions due in 2022 and later will be available under $100,000.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Hummer EV is meant to compete with Tesla&#8217;s pickup, the Cybertruck, which is supposed to go into production late next year.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neal-e-boudette" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="wall-street-pauses-as-stimulus-talks-continue"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#wall-street-pauses-as-stimulus-talks-continue">Wall Street pauses as stimulus talks continue.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="The New York Stock Exchange." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/business/21markets-brf-markets/merlin_178753866_8efef06a-ab31-40f9-8715-278e500f3ff5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The New York Stock Exchange.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Mark Lennihan/Associated Press</p></p></p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">U.S. stock futures were little changed on Wednesday, losing earlier gains, suggesting that markets on Wall Street could follow Europe&#8217;s benchmark stock indexes lower at the start of trading.

Of those, about 5,300 Hong Kong employees would be made redundant. Executives would also take pay cuts, and company will also suspend salary raises next year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The global pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on aviation and the hard truth is we must fundamentally restructure the group to survive,&#8221; Augustus Tang, the chief executive of the company said in a statement.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We have to do this to protect as many jobs as possible,&#8221; he said, adding that the company had already scaled back capacity, frozen recruitment and cut executives&#8217; salaries, but was still burning up to about $260 million monthly. Mr. Tang said he hoped to reduce that to about $65 million under the restructuring, which will begin to take effect immediately.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">So far, the pandemic has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-21/coronavirus-has-wiped-out-more-than-90-of-international-flights" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slashed more than 90 percent of international flights</a>, and it could take until 2024 for passenger traffic to reach pre-Covid-19 levels, according to the International Air Transport Association.

A day earlier, ConocoPhillips announced that it was acquiring Concho Resources, another Permian producer, for $9.7 billion.

While some analysts had predicted that Snap&#8217;s growth would tail off as people returned to school, its number of daily active users rose 18 percent to 249 million.

It came just before Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s spokesman <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Drew_Hammill/status/1318659655304941568?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gave an upbeat assessment</a> of talks on Tuesday between her and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, saying they had found &#8220;common ground as they move closer to an agreement.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi had said earlier on Tuesday that she was &#8220;optimistic&#8221; a deal could be reached with the Trump administration in the coming days. But Mr. McConnell&#8217;s remarks underscored the divisions among Republicans that have long hampered a compromise, and which have broken out into an extraordinarily open intraparty feud just two weeks before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Republicans are growing increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump and his team are too eager to reach a multitrillion-dollar agreement and are conceding far too much to the Democrats. They fear that a vote on any large bipartisan stimulus would force colleagues who are up for re-election into a difficult choice of defying the president or alienating their fiscally conservative base by embracing the big-spending bill he has demanded.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senate Republicans were also concerned that any vote on such a package could interfere with the Senate&#8217;s hasty timetable for confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court by early next week. Mr. McConnell said he told the White House he was particularly concerned a deal before then could inject unwanted unpredictability into the schedule, according to the Republicans, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a closed party luncheon.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell made it clear that he knew his counsel was likely to leak, making reference to the possibility that his remarks could appear in the news media, two of the Republicans said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A short time later, outside the hearing room where Republicans met privately, Mr. McConnell told reporters the Senate would consider a broad bipartisan stimulus deal if the White House and Democrats struck one. But he would not say if it would hold a vote before Election Day, and members of his leadership team have warned that Republican votes could be hard to come by in the chamber.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If a presidentially supported bill clears the House, at some point we&#8217;ll bring it to the floor,&#8221; he said, without elaborating on the timetable.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He made his comments around the same time that Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin were speaking by phone, in what Drew Hammill, Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s spokesman, described as a productive discussion that would continue on Wednesday. He said her target of reaching a deal by the end of the day had yielded progress.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Today&#8217;s deadline enabled the speaker and secretary to see that decisions could be reached and language could be exchanged, demonstrating that both sides are serious about finding a compromise,&#8221; Mr. Hammill <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Drew_Hammill/status/1318659655304941568" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Yet Mr. McConnell was pursuing a different track. He forced a test vote Tuesday afternoon on a narrow measure that would revive the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular small-business loan program. While Democrats support the program, most of them opposed the narrow bill, contending that a far broader package was needed.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the public they will face tighter restrictions in 10 days if a rise in infections isn’t stopped.

Merkel held an online conference with the leaders of 11 German cities to discuss a sharp increase in case numbers.

There is growing alarm in Germany where new cases have exceeded 4,000 for the second day in a row.

Of particular concern are cities such as Berlin and Frankfurt, where public health experts say a steep rise in infection rates is due to people having parties or gathering in large numbers.

Merkel and the mayors of 11 German cities today agreed that measures - already adopted in Berlin - like restrictions on the sale of alcohol at night could be introduced to other badly affected areas. The army may be used more widely to help with contact tracing.

If those measures don’t halt the rising numbers within 10 days, Germany will face tighter targeted restrictions, Merkel said.

COVID-19 has led to a number of changes in the NFL’s schedule, and it now impacts the Jets.

Instead of visiting the Chargers next Sunday, they will be in Miami to face the Dolphins, with the game at Los Angeles moved back to Week 11. Initially, the Jets were supposed to have a bye week then, but now their bye week will be in Week 10, when they were supposed to visit the Dolphins.

The NFL had to make a number of changes after Monday’s Patriots-Broncos game was postponed due to another positive coronavirus test on the Patriots. The Jets-Cardinals game on Sunday was in doubt for a while on Friday when a Jets player tested positive. But that was a false positive, it was revealed after further testing.

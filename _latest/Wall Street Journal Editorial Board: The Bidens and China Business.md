<div><p class="speakable">Most of the media is ignoring the emails found in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank">Hunter Biden's laptop</a>, but that doesn't mean they aren't news. Joe Biden has an obligation to answer questions about his son's influence-peddling and his own financial dealings -- notably regarding China.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="speakable"><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-hunter-biden-media-democrats-chris-murphy" target="_blank">TUCKER CARLSON: AMERICA&#8217;S MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE WANT YOU TO SHUT UP ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN</a></strong></p><p>The New York Post last week obtained the contents of a laptop purported to belong to Hunter. The Post has been transparent that it obtained its copy of the hard drive from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank">Trump</a> lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who says he received it from the owner of a Delaware computer-repair shop, where it was abandoned in 2019. Mr. Biden derides this as a "smear campaign," while House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff calls it without evidence "Russian disinformation."&#160;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER</a></strong></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe says the government has no intelligence to support the disinformation claim. A repair-shop order from April 2019 contains Hunter's name and what appears to be his signature. The shop owner supplied a subpoena showing the computer and hard drive were seized by the FBI in December 2019. And the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank">Biden campaign</a> hasn't said the emails are phony.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p><p>The emails regarding Hunter's business in Ukraine have been widely reported. But as intriguing is a May 2017 email thread that includes a discussion about "remuneration packages" for six people as part of a business deal with a now-defunct Chinese energy titan, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china" target="_blank">CEFC China Energy.</a> The Chinese company was international news a few years ago, after the U.S. government charged a CEFC-funded organization with money laundering, and its CEO was detained by Chinese authorities. CNN reported in 2018 that "at its height" CEFC was "hard to distinguish" from the Chinese government.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-bidens-and-china-business-11603236651" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING THIS EDITORIAL IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</a></strong></p><p class="ad gam"></p></div>

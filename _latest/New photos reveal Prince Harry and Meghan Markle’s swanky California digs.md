Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got plenty for the $14.7 million that they plunked down for their new California home.

Never-seen-before photos, from a now-deleted listing on the rental site Giggster, show a mansion that was appropriately billed as an “Italian villa,” complete with stone pillared entry gates and sculpted hedges.

Lush greenery is everywhere — manicured lawns, Italian cypress trees, 100-year-old olive trees, blooming lavender and tiered rose gardens. Also on the grounds are a tennis court, a children’s cottage and a guest house.

Inside is a library lined with built-in shelves, an office, a spa with a separate dry and wet sauna, a gym with a stripper pole, a game room, an arcade, a theater, a wine cellar and a five-car garage.

One real estate agent who spent an hour there described the 5.4-acre estate as a place “designed for someone who never wants to leave home,” the outlet reported.

The guest house has two bedrooms and two baths — an ideal setup for Meghan’s mother, Doria, who is a doting grandmother to year-old Archie.

No one is quite sure who owned the home, but speculation swirling at the time of the August sale tagged Russian tycoon Sergey Grishin. The purchase price was more than $25 million in 2009.

Estate agent Brett Buschbom told the Daily Mail: “I went through this house and an hour later I’m coming out like ‘Wow,’ the whole bottom floor felt like a resort with steam room, massage room, sauna, Jacuzzi, full bar, arcade and one of the most amazing wine cellars and that was just the basement.”

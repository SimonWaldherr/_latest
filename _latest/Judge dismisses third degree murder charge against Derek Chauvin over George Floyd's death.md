  Judge dismisses third degree murder charge against Derek Chauvin over George Floyd's death 
description: > 
  A judge has dismissed the third degree murder charge against white cop Derek Chauvin over the killing of black man George Floyd after he knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes.The former Minneapolis police officer, 44, still faces other charges including the more serious charges of second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.Cahill also denied motions to dismiss the charges of aiding and abetting against the three other fired officers charged in connection with Floyd's death.Cahill ruled that 'probable cause does not exist' for the third-degree murder charge against the officer, according to court documents.Cahill said the state did not satisfy the following three requirements for the charges to stand against Chauvin: proof of Floyd's death, proof that Chauvin caused Floyd's death, and proof that Chauvin's intentional conduct that caused Floyd's death was 'eminently dangerous to other persons' and done with a disregard for human life.

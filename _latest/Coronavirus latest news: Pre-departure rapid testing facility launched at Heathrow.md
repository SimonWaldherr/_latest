<p>A pre-departure rapid Covid-19 testing facility has been launched at Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>From Tuesday, the facilities in Terminals 2 and 5 will initially offer tests to passengers travelling to Hong Kong and Italy before they fly.</p>
<p>To start, the facilities will offer LAMP testing and will expand to offer antigen testing in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Unlike PCR tests, which are used by the NHS, LAMP and antigen tests can be processed without being sent to a laboratory.</p>
<p>Announcing the launch, aviation services company Collinson and logistics firm Swissport described the pre-departure testing regime as the "crucial next step toward keeping the travel industry moving while limiting the spread of the virus".</p>
<p>The private test costs &#163;80 and aims to provide results in around one hour, with passengers interested in using the facility required to book a test online before making their way to the airport.</p>
<p>The testing facilities will initially be open for four weeks.</p>

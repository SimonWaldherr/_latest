<div><p>Pastry Week saw further harsh judging, collapsing cages, eclair despair and several bakers in peril. Here are all the rough puff talking points&#8230;</p>
<h4>Matt Lucas is outshining co-host Noel Fielding</h4>
<p>Five episodes into his tent tenure, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2020/09/23/has-matt-lucas-single-handedly-saved-bake/">Matt Lucas continues to look like inspired casting</a>: warm, welcoming and naturally nimble-witted. He wore pastry lattice on his bald head for &#8220;a lockdown look&#8221;, gave out &#8220;valueless handshakes&#8221; and said he wouldn&#8217;t go on Channel 4 stablemate Naked Attraction because: &#8220;My body is my own business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucas even treated us to a blink-and-you&#8217;ll-miss-it Little Britain catchphrase by asking Lottie to save him a toad-in-hole pastie with an Andy Pipkin-style: &#8220;Want that one!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure, Noel Fielding got some laughs too - mainly by winding up sparring partner Hollywood for his &#8220;powerful buttocks&#8221;, &#8220;thunder fingers&#8221; and &#8220;egg-washed bronze look&#8221; - but he&#8217;s currently playing a supporting role to Lucas&#8217;s star turn. Yeah I know!</p>
<h4>Linda&#8217;s stinker saw her sent home</h4>
<p>&#8220;This is the week I wanted to get to,&#8221; said an optimistic Linda Rayfield as the episode began. &#8220;I know I can make pastry. Lots of us mums can.&#8221; Words which came back to bite her during an episode from hell.</p>
<p>Her Goan-inspired signature pasties weren&#8217;t crimped as requested and were essentially samosas. The technical challenge went even worse. Linda simply couldn&#8217;t get the choux pastry right for her eclairs, binning her batter and starting again three times. They didn&#8217;t rise, looked more like churros and Linda served them &#8220;deconstructed&#8221; with the cr&#232;me p&#226;tissi&#232;re and icing as dips. Needless to say, she came last.</p>
<p>She needed the showstopper to save her but that went disastrously too. Linda&#8217;s colourful red, gold and green pastry dome got stuck to the bowl and broke in half. &#8220;Pastry Week was supposed to be my week,&#8221; Linda shrugged sportingly. &#8220;Hey ho. Fair comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s oldest baker at 61, Linda has been a likeably chirpy presence in the tent. She&#8217;ll be best remembered for that child-like Battenberg ambulance, her mouthless Bob Marley bust and winning two technicals in a row. She can return to Bexhill-on-Sea with her head held high.&#160;</p>

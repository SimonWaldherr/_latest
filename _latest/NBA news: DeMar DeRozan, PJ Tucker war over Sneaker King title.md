In recent years, guys like PJ Tucker and <a target="_blank" title="DeMar DeRozan" href="https://clutchpoints.com/sports/nba/players/demar-derozan/b5360a01/">DeMar DeRozan</a> have been showing off their so-called shoe game more and more. They regularly post pictures on Instagram or make videos.</p><p class="code-block code-block-29"></p><p class="code-block code-block-19"></p><p id="egplayer"></p><p>Tucker is widely known in the NBA as the Sneaker King. The <a target="_blank" title="Houston Rockets" href="https://clutchpoints.com/sports/nba/houston-rockets/">Houston Rockets</a> forward allegedly has a whopping 5,000 pairs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7VKr9TT-kA">with a separate loft in his house</a> solely dedicated to them. Most of his fellow players have bowed to his unbelievable collection.</p><p class="code-block code-block-20"></p><p id="div-gpt-content-1">   </p><p>Most, but not everyone.</p><p>It looks like DeRozan is trying to steal the throne from Tucker, <a target="_blank" href="https://clutchpoints.com/rockets-news-pj-tucker-opening-sneaker-boutique-in-houston/">who also has his own sneaker store</a>. The <a target="_blank" title="San Antonio Spurs" href="https://clutchpoints.com/sports/nba/san-antonio-spurs/">San Antonio Spurs</a> guard called out the burly Rockets bruiser on Instagram, saying: &#8220;I will show everybody who really is the shoe head when it comes to these kicks! I&#8217;m just playing it cool. You got another post to show off and I will also show off.&#8221;</p><p class="code-block code-block-21"></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deebo and the cutie PJ starring in:</p><p>Shoe Wars. <a target="_blank" href="https://t.co/gDhQxDIhmq">pic.twitter.com/gDhQxDIhmq</a></p><p>&#8212; Kate (@KateBDoll) <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/KateBDoll/status/1319099444122497025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p>Of course, the long-time reigning sneaker champion of the NBA responded quickly. Tucker said: &#8220;Can somebody tell my little bro, DeMar DeRozan if he wants the smoke. He knows better than anybody where to find me.&#8221;</p><p class="code-block code-block-22"></p><p id="div-gpt-content-2">   </p><p>The 31-year-old DeMar DeRozan also has a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=RDv5OK_xBaBUk&amp;v=XDaTKkVWOdc">room filled with sneakers</a>. He likes collecting signature kicks of <a target="_blank" title="Michael Jordan" href="https://clutchpoints.com/sports/nba/players/michael-jordan/3226/">Michael Jordan</a>, Penny Hardaway, and his childhood hero Kobe Bryant. He said he started his love for shoes when he saw Kobe&#8217;s Crazy 8&#8217;s for the first time in high school. During one of DeRozan&#8217;s stints with the <a target="_blank" title="Toronto Raptors" href="https://clutchpoints.com/sports/nba/toronto-raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a>, he wore 15 different Jordans in their first 15 games.</p><p>But until DeRozan proves his worth, PJ Tucker is still the undisputed NBA Sneaker King. He owns hundreds of what they call Holy Grail kicks or the rarest pairs in the business. Plus, there are countless stories about Tucker&#8217;s shoe obsession: He once wore six pairs in a single game; he <a target="_blank" href="https://spacecityscoop.com/2020/05/03/houston-rockets-p-j-tucker-impress-michael-jordan/">impressed MJ himself</a> with his Js, and; he <a target="_blank" href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/pj-tucker-spends-30k-sneaker-shopping/">spends over $30,000</a> on sneaker shopping (even once dropping <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/how-much-nba-houston-rockets-star-pj-tucker-spent-on-sneakers.html">around $200,000</a> on kicks in one year).</p><p class="code-block code-block-23"></p><img width="300" height="168" src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Indiana-coach-shares-bold-approach-for-franchise-1-300x168.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="Pacers, Nate Brokgren"><strong>JUST IN:</strong> <strong> <a href="https://clutchpoints.com/pacers-news-indiana-coach-shares-bold-approach-franchise/" rel="prev">New Pacers coach shares bold approach for franchise</a></strong><p id="taboola-below-article-thumbnails"></p>     <p class="code-block code-block-28"></p><p class="posts-nav-link"></p><img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CPTextNoBorders.png"></div>

<div><p>In the latest of the prime minister&#8217;s announcements on 22 September, people who can work from home, are again being encouraged to do so. While those who can&#8217;t should still go to work and follow covid secure practices.</p><p>&#160;There is no date to fully return to offices anytime soon as we head into autumn and winter though.&#160;</p><p></p><p>&#160;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-work-from-home-coronavirus-july-2021-facebook-twitter-a9640206.html">As reported by <i>The Independent</i></a>, Google has told its employees that they&#8217;ll be working remotely until the summer of 2021, while other tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter have allowed most employees to work remotely indefinitely.</p><p>So as we&#8217;re now six months into working from home for lots of people, your workspace is probably starting to feel in need of a revamp &#8211; especially if your make-shift office and bedroom have merged into one.</p><p>However, as the pandemic has forced us to both work and live in our personal spaces, it's important to keep your free time and work hours separate so work doesn't consume every room. </p><p>Easier said than done you might think, but that's where the folding desk comes in. Compact, neat and mounted to your wall, it can be folded away once your working day is over. Out of sight, and hopefully out of mind too.</p><p>That means no more working from your bed, sofa or kitchen table and not feeling like you can't face eating your meals at the latter anymore.</p><p>From the quirky to minimal, here are nine different styles for every budget and room size. </p><p>You can trust our independent round-ups.

<p>"There are a whole host of issues being litigated right now. The consequence of this could have absolute results, specially if some of these cases, as we know, wind their way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. And especially if Judge Barrett would be confirmed to a Justice Barrett, those are the kind of impact and the kind of consequences that could truly have an impact on who wins the election. I not saying that she's partisan. I'm just saying that the issue upon which it might turn, the presidency might turn, could literally be in the hands of judges because because of this."</p>

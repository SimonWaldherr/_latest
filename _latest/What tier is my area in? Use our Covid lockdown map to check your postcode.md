  Most of the country is covered by the medium alert level, which consists of the current national measures for England, including the Rule of Six and 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants, while the additional high level reflects the restrictions already in place in many areas as part of local lockdowns.These are primarily aimed at reducing household-to-household transmission by reducing all mixing by households or support bubbles indoors, while the Rule of Six continues to apply outdoors.However, the Government has also introduced a very high alert level - enforced in the Liverpool City region from October 14 and Lancashire since October 17 - for areas where transmissions rates are rising most rapidly, bringing with it a "baseline" of restrictions including banning social mixing indoors and private gardens and closing pubs and bars.

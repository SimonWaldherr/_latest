  As I listened to the president brag as if he is as successful as he says he is, I was reminded of the way that his family and business associates talked to me about him before he became president.Back in 2015, I noted that they all seemed to tell the same anecdotes about him, even when those could be disproved with some simple fact-checking.Worse was the way that they talked about him as if he really was perhaps the greatest leader on earth.

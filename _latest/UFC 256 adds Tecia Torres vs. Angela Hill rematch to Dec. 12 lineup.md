<div><p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/tecia-torres">Tecia Torres</a> and <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/angela-hill">Angela Hill</a> are going to run it back.</p>
<p>At UFC 256 on Dec. 12, two longtime members of the UFC&#8217;s 115-pound division, Hill (12-9 MMA, 7-9 UFC) and Torres (11-5 MMA, 7-5 UFC), will meet in a rematch of their clash from more than five years ago.</p>
<p>Multiple people with knowledge of the matchup recently informed MMA Junkie of the booking but asked to remain anonymous since the promotion has yet to make an official announcement.</p>
<p>While no official announcement has been made, UFC 256 is expected to take place at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas with a main card on pay-per-view following prelims on a combination of ESPN and ESPN+.</p>
<p>The first fight between Hill and Torres took place in October 2015 at UFC 188, which was the UFC&#8217;s first event in Mexico. That night, Torres beat Hill by unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Since that fight, Hill has gone 10-8 and briefly was cut from the UFC before re-signing with the promotion in early 2017 after a stint as Invicta FC&#8217;s strawweight champion. Torres has gone 5-5 in 10 UFC appearances since their first matchup.</p>
<p>Hill will look to rebound from back-to-back split decision losses to Michelle Waterson and Claudia Gadelha. Torres will be looking to turn a recent win over Brianna van Buren into a winning streak.</p>
<p>With the addition, the UFC 256 lineup includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amanda Nunes vs. Megan Anderson &#8211; for UFC women&#8217;s featherweight title</li>
<li>Petr Yan vs. Aljamain Sterling &#8211; for UFC bantamweight title</li>
<li>Mackenzie Dern vs. Virna Jandiroba</li>
<li>Ronaldo Souza vs. Marvin Vettori</li>
<li>Dwight Grant vs. Li Jingliang</li>
<li>Angela Hill vs. Tecia Torres</li>
</ul>

  Tropical Storm Epsilon forms in Atlantic; expected to be at or near hurricane strength this week 
description: > 
  The National Hurricane Center said Tropical Storm Epsilon formed in the Atlantic Ocean Monday morning and could be at or near hurricane strength by Thursday.Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next 72 hours, and the storm is forecast to approach Bermuda as a hurricane later this week.However, "some gradual development of this system is possible late this week while it moves slowly northwestward or north-northwestward over the western Caribbean Sea," the Hurricane Center said.If it develops into a tropical storm, it would take on the name Zeta.With Epsilon's formation, a total of 26 systems have reached tropical storm strength or greater so far in the Atlantic Ocean this season.

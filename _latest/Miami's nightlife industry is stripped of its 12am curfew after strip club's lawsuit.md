  Miami's nightlife industry is stripped of its 12am curfew after strip club's lawsuit 
description: > 
  The city of Miami has been forced to lift its 12am curfew on all clubs, restaurants and bars, following a successful lawsuit filed by a local strip club.In the case, Tootsie’s Cabaret sued Miami-Dade County to overturn restrictions that forced businesses, including clubs, bars and restaurants, to shutter between midnight and 6am.Judge Beatrice Butchko, of Florida’s 11th Circuit Court, agreed, ruling Friday that Miami-Dade was banned from enforcing the curfew herein.The city announced Saturday that police will no longer enforce the four-month-old curfew order, in accordance with the judge's ruling.From a practical matter, the curfew is unenforceable until the appeal is settled by the courts,’ Gimenez said in a statement.

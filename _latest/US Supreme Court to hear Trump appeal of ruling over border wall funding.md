  US Supreme Court to hear Trump appeal of ruling over border wall funding 
description: > 
  The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear the Trump administration’s appeal of a lower court ruling, which said the organisation improperly diverted money to build portions of the border wall with Mexico.The high court previously allowed construction of the border wall to continue, even after a federal appeals court ruled in June that the administration had illegally sidestepped Congress in transferring the Defence Department funds.Log in here Update preferencesMr Trump ended the shutdown after Congress gave him approximately $1.4 bn (£1.07) in border wall funding, but that was far less than the $5.7bn (£4.3bn) he was originally seeking.At the time, the money Mr Trump identified for the wall included $2.5bn (£1.9bn) in Defence Department money, $3.6bn (£2.7bn) from military construction funds and $600m (£461m) from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5bn in Defence Department funds.

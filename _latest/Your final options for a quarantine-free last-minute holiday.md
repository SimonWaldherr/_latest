<div><p>Missed out on a family holiday this year? You couldn&#8217;t make the most of the lockdown sunshine; your summer trip to the Med was cancelled; your staycation break was blown away by the August gales. Now schools are back, so you have one last chance for a rewarding trip for all &#8211; the autumn half term.&#160;</p>
<p>At the best of times you have to be selective about your destination &#8211; late October is a tricky time weather-wise. And the current Covid world of quarantine and cancellations and the unpredictability of the &#8220;air corridor&#8221; arrangements is going to make things even more complicated. You are going to have to tread very carefully and be prepared for last-minute changes. But don&#8217;t give up.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve put together a guide to help you navigate the uncertainties and maximise your chances of getting away &#8211; whether you&#8217;re determined to find sunshine or just want a good dose of culture on a city break.</p>
<p>Discover the most likely destinations to be a safe bet this half-term below or keep scrolling for all the latest advice on when to book and how to get insurance.</p>
<h3>The best bets</h3>
<h4>Rhodes</h4>
<p><b>The risk:</b>&#160;Greece escaped the early months of Covid-19 lightly, but the resumption of tourism in August coincided with a rise in the infection rate. Now that the summer peak is over and most holidaymakers have gone home, things have stabilised.&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/articles/greece-when-can-travel-again-latest-advice-lockdown-flights/">A number of islands were removed</a>&#160;from the travel corridors list as part of the Government&#8217;s new regional approach, but all have now been reinstated bar Mykonos; Rhodes remains green for travellers. Furthermore, the whole of the UK is now aligned on its advice for Greece.</p>
<p><b>The reward:&#160;</b>Close to the Turkish coast and almost as far south,&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/rhodes/articles/expert-travel-guide-rhodes/">Rhodes</a>&#160;stays a degree or two warmer than Crete throughout October, and it too has the advantage of a decent choice of flights from several UK airports.&#160;</p>
<p><b>Getting there:</b>&#160;All the major tour operators including Jet2 (<a href="https://www.jet2holidays.com/">jet2holidays.com</a>) are currently offering packages.&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/rhodes/hotels/">Telegraph Travel&#8217;s favourite hotels on the island can be found here</a>.</p>

<h4>Athens</h4>
<p><b>The risk:&#160;</b>For now, the mainland still has the all clear.</p>
<p><b>The reward:</b>&#160;What makes&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/athens/articles/athens-travel-guide/">Athens</a>&#160;particularly attractive in the coronavirus era is that life is lived outdoors pretty much year-round &#8211; from its historical sites and squares to its open-air restaurants and caf&#233;s. Add to that the fact that the pocket-sized city centre is easily walkable, so public transport can mostly be avoided.</p>
<p><b>Getting there:</b>&#160;Fly into the capital with any one of a number of airline options including WizzAir, EasyJet, British Airways and more. Currently there many options from around &#163;100 return.&#160;</p>

<h4>Madeira</h4>
<p><b>The risk: </b>Mainland Portugal is off the menu for now, but Madeira, where the case rate is low, remains a quarantine-free option.</p>
<p><b>The reward:</b>&#160;Best known for its old-fashioned charm (think preened gardens and afternoon tea), Madeira is also the perfect playground for those seeking on-foot adventures: it&#8217;s a crumple of volcanic basalt, rampant greenery, deep troughs and gnarly ridges.&#160;</p>
<p><b>Getting there:</b> Jet2, easyJet and BA all have options, with return fares from around &#163;200.</p>

<h4>The Caribbean</h4>
<p><b>The risk:</b>&#160;Several Caribbean islands with travel corridors &#8211; including Barbados and St Lucia &#8211; are now open to tourists, so long as they can present evidence of a negative Covid test. Firms that offer the service include&#160;<a href="https://www.c19testing.co.uk/fortravel">C19 Testing</a>. Case rates on both&#160;Barbados and St Lucia are low.&#160;</p>
<p><b>The reward:</b>&#160;Barbados and St Lucia. Need we say more?&#160;</p>
<p><b>Getting there:&#160;</b>Tui has packages to St Lucia from around &#163;600pp; BA resumes flights to the island next week. BA is already flying to Barbados, with late October returns from around &#163;400.</p>
<h3>Open, but with risks</h3>
<h4>Cyprus</h4>
<p><b>The risk:</b> Cyprus has seen a rise in infections, and, as of October 20, its seven-day case rate has reached 53.6 per 100,000, putting its travel corridor at risk. Book at the last minute (changes to the quarantine-free list are made on Thursday evenings) to avoid disappointment. The UK is in Cyprus&#8217;s &#8220;Category B&#8221;, which means tourists are permitted to enter, but must provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test on arrival. This must have been obtained less than 72 hours before travel, through a private clinic (the cost is usually around the &#163;150 mark). Children under 12 years old do not require a test.</p>
<p><b>The reward:</b> Nowhere in the Med does the summer warmth cling on more reliably than in Cyprus, which still gets nine hours of sunshine a day and temperatures peaking at 77F (25C) in October. Paphos is the most attractive of the south coast resorts.</p>
<p><b>Getting there: </b>Flights are looking quite expensive (&#163;200-&#163;300). Tui (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.tui.co.uk/" target="_blank">tui.co.uk</a>) has plenty of package deals.</p>
 
<h4>Sweden</h4>
<p><b>The risk:</b> Sweden&#8217;s seven-day case rate has also been inching up, and currently stands at 46.6 per 100,000. It has no restrictions on British arrivals, however.</p>
<p><b>The reward:</b> According to Telegraph Travel&#8217;s Oliver Smith, who visited this month, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/sweden/articles/sweden-no-masks-utopia/" target="_blank">Sweden offers the chance to travel back in time</a>. He wrote: &#8220;A few tell-tale signs of the pandemic &#8211; sticky tape on the floor, perspex screens at the till &#8211; can be seen in some shops. But compared to fearful Britain it felt like utopia.&#160;Office workers cradled beers and chatted on the terraces. Couples ambled along the cobbles, arm-in-arm. But best of all? Nobody was wearing a mask.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p><b>Getting there: </b>Ryanair, BA and SAS fly to Stockholm, with returns for under &#163;100.&#160;</p>

<h4>Germany</h4>
<p><b>The risk:</b>&#160;Germany&#8217;s seven-day case rate, having been successfully supressed for longer than its European neighbours, is now on the rise (it is now 49 per 100,000). Furthermore, arrivals from much of the UK (including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), must take a test before they travel or on arrival.&#160;</p>
<p><b>The reward:</b>&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/germany/articles/germany-autumn-holiday/" target="_blank">William Cook, writing for Telegraph Travel, says</a>: &#8220;If you&#8217;ve never been to Germany, the Black Forest is the perfect place to start, a land of dense dark forests which inspired the spooky fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. Its wooded hills are intensely atmospheric, and there&#8217;s a wide range of walking trails, suitable for all ages and abilities. Serious hikers love it here, but even if you&#8217;re only moderately fit it&#8217;s still a wonderful place to wander.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Getting there: </b>There are still direct flights to a clutch of German cities, including Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Dusseldorf and Stuttgart.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>On the quarantine list, but watch this space</h3>
<h4>The Canary Islands</h4>
<p><b>The risk:</b> While the seven-day infection rate in Spain soared, and is now over 160 per 100,000, the Canaries &#8211; 620 miles away in the Atlantic &#8211; has had relatively few cases. Nevertheless, the&#160;UK Government is still to give the islands a travel corridor.</p>
<p><b>The reward: </b>They are so far south that the holiday season lasts all year, and October is one of the best months of all.&#160;</p>
<p><b>Getting there: </b>There are currently flights. If they return to green-list status, it is virtually certain that all the big tour operators will start to offer packages again. See&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/canary-islands/hotels/" target="_blank">Telegraph Travel&#8217;s recommended hotels in the Canaries</a>.</p>
<h4>Sicily</h4>
<p><b>The risk:&#160;</b>It was thought that Italy&#8217;s islands may be spared the same fate as the mainland, with a regional air bridge, but Grant Shapps confirmed that would not be the case. Again, this option is looking unlikely for half-term barring a last-minute change of tack.</p>
<p><b>The reward:</b>&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/sicily/articles/sicily-expert-travel-guide/">Sicily</a>&#160;offers a wonderful combination of historical sights &#8211; from the ancient Greeks, to the Normans and the 18th-century baroque, a spectacular coastline, some lovely resorts and a warm autumn. At this time of year it&#8217;s a great destination either for the beach or some sightseeing, or a combination of both.</p>
<p><b>Getting there:</b>&#160;BA has returns to Catania from about &#163;200. The Thinking Traveller (<a href="https://www.thethinkingtraveller.com/">thethinkingtraveller.com</a>) has great villas.</p>
 
<h3>When should I book?</h3>
<p>As you have surely noticed, the Government has been changing its advice on which countries are &#8220;safe&#8221; to travel to &#8211;&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/countries-with-quarantine-for-uk-arrivals/" target="_blank">the &#8220;green list&#8221;</a>&#160;&#8211; each week. We have seen major destinations such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and France removed from the list. An announcement is usually made on a Thursday evening, and less than 48 hours&#8217; notice may be given on the change. If a country is taken off the list, then returning travellers have to self-isolate for 14 days and tour operators invariably cancel packages to the country. Usually, airlines also drastically reduce the number of flights.</p>
<p>The Government previously decided to take a country off its green list if cases there exceeded 20 per 100,000 people over the previous week, though with the rate in the UK currently much higher it is now exercising more leniency.</p>
<p>What all this means, quite simply, is that you should book late &#8211; maybe a week or two before departure &#8211; and check the current infection rate before you commit.</p>
<p>In the UK, accommodation is likely to be in high demand as there are fewer factors to consider for a domestic holiday (local lockdowns notwithstanding; see below). This is clearly visible on travel company websites, where some of the more popular possibilities for a week away on British soil are close to selling out &#8211; if they have not done so already. There are still some lovely option available though. The best move is then to book early for staycations but&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/hotels-vs-holiday-rentals-which-should-i-book/" target="_blank">check cancellation policies</a>&#160;before committing.&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/articles/best-uk-breaks-for-october-half-term/" target="_blank">You can find some great options here</a>, or read on for more advice on travelling abroad and where to go in Europe this half-term.</p>
<h3>Will my money be safe?</h3>
<p>Many travel firms are struggling and we may well see a rush of financial failures before long. But as long as you book with an Atol-bonded tour operator, or &#8211; in most cases &#8211; pay for your holiday with a credit card, you will get a refund in the event of insolvency. Package holiday providers also have a legal responsibility for your safety, so they won&#8217;t take you to a destination that the FCO advises against, and they are legally obliged to refund you for a cancellation &#8211; though many have been taking weeks or months to do so.</p>
<h3>What about insurance?</h3>
<p>Many travel insurance companies have now started to sell policies again and nearly all will cover you if get ill. Relatively few offer Covid-related cancellation cover. Exceptions are AllClear (<a href="https://allcleartravel.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">allcleartravel.co.uk</a>), CoverforYou (<a href="https://www.coverforyou.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">coverforyou.com</a>), Staysure (<a href="https://www.staysure.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">staysure.co.uk</a>) and Trailfinders (<a href="http://www.trailfinders.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">trailfinders.com</a>). One of the few companies that can arrange insurance if you travel against FCO advice is Campbell Irvine (<a href="https://campbellirvinedirect.com/CIDirect/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">campbellirvinedirect.com</a>).</p>
<h3>What about a UK lockdown?</h3>
<p>Another key thing to consider, of course, is whether your plans might be scuppered by what happens in the UK. Even if your chosen destination stays open, an uptick in coronavirus cases in your area might mean that you are subjected to another lockdown. Wales will enter a second lockdown on Friday, for example, with all travel banned. So, before booking, you need to check explicitly the policy of the operator or airline you are dealing with and whether they will allow you to cancel without penalty.&#160;&#160;</p>

The Seattle Seahawks have indefinitely suspended radio host Dori Monson following a transphobic tweet he sent Wednesday evening, according to Michael-Shawn Dugar of The Athletic.

Monson, who has since deleted the tweet, leads the Seahawks' pre- and postgame shows and works for Seattle's KIRO Radio 97.3 FM, where he hosts his own show featuring weekly interviews with Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll.

The 59-year-old posted his tweet during the Washington gubernatorial debate while incumbent Jay Inslee discussed the state's adherence to science.

“The state where I could go to Olympia tomorrow and change my birth (certificate) to say I was a girl on 10/2/61 HAHAHAHA," Monson wrote.

Per Dugar:

"In response to the claims of transphobia directed at him, Monson decried 'cancel culture' for coming after him and maintained his words were taken out of context. He said the libertarian in him doesn’t allow him to care whether adults would like to change their gender. 'I couldn’t care less,' he said this week.

'They’re saying you’re laughing at transgender people,' Monson said. 'No, I’m laughing at Jay Inslee saying we are a science-based state. But I hurt a couple people I care about deeply. I personally called them this morning, said I’m sorry.' Monson later added: 'If you were hurt by that, I’m sorry. Not where I was going, not my intent.'

The conservative radio host has previously made comments critical of the Black Lives Matter movement and has victim-blamed members of the Black community killed in police shootings.

Monson was not on the air Friday and did not record his weekly interview with Carroll.

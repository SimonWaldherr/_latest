<p>Rishi Sunak will be told to end the "absolutely bonkers" region-by-region negotiations over Tier 3 restrictions during a crunch meeting with industry figures this morning.&#160;</p>
<p>The Chancellor is holding a roundtable with business leaders, ahead of a statement to the House of Commons at 11:30am, where it is expected that he will set out further support for businesses in Tier 2 and Tier 3.&#160;</p>
<p>As well as being called on to reduce employer contributions to the jobs support scheme - which replaces the furlough scheme from early November - and give grants to local authorities in Tier 2 so they can help distressed businesses directly, ministers will also be called on to standardise a package for those areas entering Tier 3.&#160;</p>
<p>This would ensure local businesses understand what support is on offer and are better able to plan, said one figure who was close to the situation.&#160;</p>
<p>"You have to standardise these local lockdowns," he told the Telegraph. "The rolling negotiations don't&#160;make any sense from a business perspective.</p>
<p>"If you are trying to action something urgently, it is absolutely bonkers to have this situation."</p>
<p>It would also improve relationships between local and central governments, saying having the two sides "at logger heads doesn't exactly&#160;set you up for a swift recovery."</p>
<p>While the Treasury refused to comment on Wednesday night, Jesse Norman, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, told MPs on Tuesday that the current financial package was "evolving".</p>

Los Angeles Lakers big man Anthony Davis reportedly plans to opt out of the final season of his contract.

Fans of other teams shouldn't get too excited, though, because Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported Davis intends to re-sign with the Lakers after doing so. The University of Kentucky product has a player option worth more than $28.7 million on his contract for the 2020-21 campaign.

Davis opened up about his future following the NBA Finals victory over the Miami Heat and told reporters he had "no idea" how he'd approach the offseason.

"I had a great time in L.A. this year," he said. "It's been nothing but joy and amazement. Over the next couple of months, we'll figure it out. I'm not 100 percent sure."

It is no surprise the seven-time All-Star plans on remaining with Los Angeles.

After all, he failed to make it out of the second round of the playoffs during his seven years with the New Orleans Pelicans despite being a dominant playmaker and matchup nightmare. Then, the Pelicans traded him to the Lakers, and he won a championship in his first season with them.

Playing alongside LeBron James makes life easier for almost everyone but especially for a fellow All-Star like Davis. While he was always the focal point of defenses during his time with the Pelicans, Davis knows opponents cannot afford to consistently double-team him because it will open opportunities for James.

There are also few players in NBA history who are better equipped to find Davis when he is open than James, who has always been an unselfish superstar.

"You see the work and preparation LeBron puts in every day, and you understand why this is his 10th NBA Finals appearance," Davis said before the Lakers won the title, per Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports. "He never stops. I plan to follow this motherf--ker to hopefully nine more Finals. We're all ready to go."

It doesn't sound like Davis is ready to leave the Lakers anytime soon.

<div><p id="speakable-summary">Remember back in March when the VC game was done for the year, checkbooks were snapping shut and startup layoffs led the headlines? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/as-layoffs-slow-and-churn-improves-is-startup-health-improving/">So much for all that</a>. Q3&#8217;s venture capital numbers are in and they are anything but weak.</p>
<p>In retrospect, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/second-quarter-vc-investing-totals-appear-lackluster/">the Q2 VC slowdown</a> looks more like a short-lived recharge ahead of a big push in Q3 than anything existential. We can see this today through the lens of data concerning what happened after June concluded and we moved into Q3.</p>
<p>According to data from PitchBook (<a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q3-2020-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor">data source</a>) and CBInsights (<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-capital-q3-2020/">data source</a>), there was a lot to like about the third quarter if you were a U.S.-based startup.</p>

<h2>A massive third quarter</h2>
<p>To get a clear look at the U.S. venture capital market, we&#8217;ll start from the top down. So, the biggest numbers first, followed by increasingly narrow slices of data so we can drill down into smaller startups.</p>
<p>First, the top-line numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How much money was raised by U.S.-based startups in Q3 2020?</strong> $36.5 billion, according to CBInsights, $37.8 billion according to PitchBook. Those numbers are effectively the same for purposes. CBInsights calls the number a seven-quarter high, up 22% from the Q3 2019 number and 30% from the Q2 2020 result. PitchBook agrees that Q3 2020 was strong, but has its count just under Q2 2020&#8217;s own.</li>
<li><strong>How many deals was that money spread between?</strong> CBInsights counts 1,461 VC deals in Q3 2020 for U.S.-based startups. Per its numbers, that figure is up 1% from Q2 2020 and down 11% from Q3 2019. PitchBook, in contrast, counts 2,990 total deals, inclusive of rounds that it expects to be added as information about the quarter fills in. That tally &#8220;held steady&#8221; compared to Q3 2019, per the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>What to make of all this information? Simple: Q3 2020 U.S.-based startup venture capital dollar volume was very strong, with deal counts coming in slightly weaker.</p>
<p>This means that we saw fewer, larger deals in the quarter on average, right? Let&#8217;s see:</p><p class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></p>			</div>

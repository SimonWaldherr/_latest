Boris Johnson is gearing up for yet another battle with his party over plans to impose a circuit breaker lockdown, as one Cabinet minister played down the prospect this morning.

Government sources last night told The Telegraph the Prime Minister could order a two-week closure of pubs, restaurants and some other businesses if measures brought in on Wednesday in Covid hotspots do not reverse the spread of the virus. It follows an intervention by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, exhorting the Government to deploy a half-term circuit breaker.

But Rishi Sunak and other hawks including several veteran MPs are likely to push back hard against such a move unless it comes with a time-limit guarantee, amid fears it could pave the way for another full-blown lockdown.

One backbencher said it was "very lazy thinking". He added: "This circuit breaker doesn't fix any problems, it just temporarily squashes the virus until it goes up again... the PM is in real trouble with the party on it. And what happens if the lefties and scientists (normally the same thing) say it should continue for longer? Then what?"

Crunch time for a decision is likely to be late next week, with Downing Street keen to avoid the "last chance" partying seen in Liverpool last night.

But asked this morning if there was going to be a circuit breaker in the next fortnight - which would lead into half-term Therese Coffey told Sky News: "I don't believe that is the case but as I say this will continue to be a decision that the Prime Minister will lead on."

The Work and Pensions Secretary added: "We have the three tiers and we need to make sure we give that the chance to work", suggesting another national lockdown would be "not really fair" to those who live in areas with lower rates.

Our governing system – indeed, our Western political culture – is based on the idea that the people as a whole can make rational decisions; that through open debate and argument based on agreed principles we can arrive at socially acceptable policy. This has generally been taken to mean that those in authority must address public criticism, offer credible evidence for controversial judgements, and respect the views of those who have been elected to represent the voters.

Without those assumptions, the whole edifice of modern democracy collapses. In the United States, the worry is that demagoguery and superstition might undermine this idea. But there is something happening here – without the absurd showmanship and the obvious irresponsibility – that is fundamentally disturbing as well: it is more serious ultimately than the immediate threat to sectors of the economy.

The narrow pursuit of a single strategy on preventing the spread of Covid, engineered by officials and apparently uncritically (some might say, blindly) adopted by the government, could be unfortunate enough in its practical consequences. But more significant, and more damaging to our long-term national life, is the rejection of that seminal, axiomatic truth that is at the heart of a free society: that anyone making public policy must be expected to defend his position in a way that stands up to examination.

Here is an example of how not to do this: when Professor Chris Whitty appeared before MPs and local political leaders last week, he was presented with the fact that in a majority of those areas which had been under strict lockdown measures, case numbers had continued to soar. His response to this was to say that without the lockdown, it could have been so much worse.

Could it? How do we know that? How could we (or he) possibly know it? It is pure conjecture. And on the basis of a supposition – which is in turn based on a contentious hypothesis – the economy of large parts of the North of England may be sunk.

Of course, the Whitty proposition might be correct. But as he has framed it, it cannot be disproved or even criticised. And that is the real, substantial threat to our politics. What has happened to the intellectual confidence of the Western idea that we are (or should be) robust enough to take on an opponent and defend a position with thoroughness and verifiable information? Where is the tacit assumption that if we are not so robust, we should not be entitled to hold a position of power? That the most important qualification for public authority is that we accept the need to make a case for a decision that is plausible enough to stand up to challenge?

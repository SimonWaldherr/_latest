<p>&#8220;The grief is immeasurable with the loss of a child,&#8221; Redford&#8217;s rep, Cindi Berger, told Page Six in a statement on Tuesday. &#8220;Jamie was a loving son, husband and father.

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re heartbroken. He lived a beautiful, impactful life &amp; was loved by many,&#8221; she wrote, sharing several family photos. &#8220;As his wife of 32 yrs, I&#8217;m most grateful for the two spectacular children we raised together. I don&#8217;t know what we would&#8217;ve done w/o them over the past 2yrs.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2005, James and his father co-founded the Redford Center, which &#8220;uses impact-driven film and media to accelerate environmental and climate justice, solutions and repair,&#8221; according to its website.</p>

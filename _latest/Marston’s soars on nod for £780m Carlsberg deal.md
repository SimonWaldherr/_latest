Shares in Marston’s soared by almost a tenth on Friday after the competition regulator gave its approval to a £780m merger with Carlsberg.

The Competition and Markets Authority said it had cleared the combination of the businesses, after finding that concerns raised over the deal did not warrant blocking it.

The regulator said Marston’s owns many pubs across the UK that might choose to serve more Carlsberg products and fewer independent brands.

“The CMA found, however, that Marston’s pubs form only a small part of the potential UK customer base for brewers, and that independent brewers would continue to have sufficient access to pubs after the merger, allowing them to compete effectively,” it said.

It drew a similar conclusion about the combined companies’ wholesale operations, saying that brewers will have sufficient alternative wholesalers to choose from after the deal.

The companies’ breweries are also different enough for there not to be any real concerns, the CMA said. Carlsberg produces mainly lager, while Marston’s focuses on ale.

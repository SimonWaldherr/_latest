<div><p>Sir Jony Ive, the British designer behind the iPod and iPhone, has joined Airbnb as a consultant, his first major project since leaving Apple last year.</p>
<p>Airbnb announced that Sir Jony&#8217;s company, LoveFrom, would work with the short-term rental service in a &#8220;multi-year relationship&#8221; to design new products and services.</p>
<p>Sir Jony <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/27/sir-jony-british-designer-behind-iphone-imac-leave-apple-27/">left Apple last year </a>after 27 years in which he was the design chief behind some of the company&#8217;s most iconic products and a close accomplice of Steve Jobs. He has continued to work with the iPhone maker since then, but Airbnb is his first public project outside the company.</p>
<p>He is a close acquaintance of Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky, whom he praised in 2015 for creating a &#8220;remarkable start-up&#8221;, and the two worked on a redesign of Airbnb&#8217;s logo in 2014.&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/06/11/angela-ahrendts-joins-wpp-board/">Angela Ahrendts</a>, the former Apple retail chief, joined Airbnb&#8217;s board last year. Announcing the move, Mr Chesky said that Sir Jony would work on &#8220;the next generation of Airbnb products and services&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>The company had been working on a range of initiatives including a loyalty programme and a system for booking air travel, but it shut down work on many of its more far-flung ideas as the coronavirus pandemic forced it to lay off a quarter of its workforce. It has since recovered, and has filed for a US stock market flotation that could take place this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jony and I have been good friends for many years, and he has been gracious enough to provide me with guidance and advice,&#8221; Chesky wrote in an email to staff. &#8220;We share the same belief in the value and importance of creativity and design. We each believe not only in making objects and interfaces, but in crafting services and experiences.&#8221;</p>

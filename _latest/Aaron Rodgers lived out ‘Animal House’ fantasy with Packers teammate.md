<div><p>The most memorable &#8220;performance&#8221; of Aaron Rodgers&#8217; reign as Packers quarterback may have taken place at a Wisconsin frat party.</p>
<p>Recalling a series of stories from the quarterback&#8217;s vault, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30155009/karaoke-trivia-frat-parties-tales-aaron-rodgers-inner-weirdness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN detailed Wednesday</a>&#160;how a then 20-something Rodgers befriended fellow quarterback Graham Harrell in 2010, likening their friendship to brothers in a fraternity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bro, you&#8217;re getting paddled when we get back to the house,&#8221; Rodgers would quip to Harrell if he failed to outperform another quarterback, Matt Flynn of the &#8220;enemy fraternity,&#8221; at practice.</p>
<p>Coining their &#8220;fraternity&#8221; Tau Kappa Epsilon, which is a national organization, Rodgers and Harrell&#8217;s fictional Greek universe clashed with the real world one day at training camp, when a ball boy revealed he happened to be their TKE brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, uh &#8230; we&#8217;re TKEs?&#8221; Harrell said at the time, to which the ball boy responded, &#8220;No way, I&#8217;m a TKE!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two quarterbacks, who practiced at a local college campus, received an invite to the fall &#8220;Carnation Crush&#8221; event, to which Rodgers said, &#8220;There is no way in the world we&#8217;re missing this.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>In between mixing with the TKE president of the St. Norbert College chapter, Rodgers and Harrell also took part in a round of flip cup &#8212; &#8220;Rodgers isn&#8217;t very good, but he finally gets his cup over. Harrell is a complete disaster,&#8221; according to the account.</p>
<p>As the event continues, a ceremony of sorts takes place, with brothers of the fraternity taking a knee and holding out their hands for a member of a sorority who &#8220;will be crowned as a queen.&#8221; Rodgers joins the chorus with his &#8220;brothers,&#8221; as Harrell utters, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t even real life, bro.&#8221; He then takes a knee with his quarterback.</p>
<p>Rodgers, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/23/aaron-rodgers-embracing-better-head-space-after-danica-patrick-split/">who has been open about</a> his carefree attitude this season, isn&#8217;t limited to frat mixers. As the now 36-year-old quarterback is also a fan of karaoke sessions with his fellow quarterbacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could definitely tell that he practiced,&#8221; Joe Callahan recounted. &#8220;I would also definitely double-check the calibration on that microphone because his score seemed a little too high that day.&#8221;</p>

  2020 Draft Prospects Who Are the Most NBA-Ready 
description: > 
  1 of 8Antonio Calanni/Associated PressWhile there is debate over Deni Avdija's NBA ceiling, teams should see a plug-and-play forward for the 2020-21 season.MVP of the Israeli Basketball Super League, he also earned a regular role in the EuroLeague, considered to feature the second-toughest competition in the world.Avdija's well-rounded skill set creates versatility that should help him adapt quicker, regardless of where he ends up.He isn't a knockdown shooter, but he hit 61 threes in 59 games in 2019-20, highlighting enough shot-making ability to threaten defenses.Even if he doesn't have the quickest feet, Avdija makes an effort to get in a stance around the perimeter and body up with bigs inside.

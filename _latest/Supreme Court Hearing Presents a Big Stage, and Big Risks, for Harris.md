Mr. Graham, the committee chairman in an unexpectedly difficult fight back home, is in a particularly visible role. He will be under fire for proceeding with a hearing Democrats consider out of bounds given its proximity to the election.

In the debate, Ms. Harris sought to drive home the point that Republicans were rushing the nomination against historical precedent, noting that Abraham Lincoln in 1864 deferred his opportunity to fill a Supreme Court seat that came open only weeks before the election.

“Joe and I are very clear,” she said, “the American people are voting right now and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.”

Ms. Harris had planned to attend the hearings in person unless health and safety considerations arose. But on Sunday, she announced that she would instead monitor the proceedings from her Senate office, reinforcing the Democratic argument that Republicans are acting irresponsibly in pushing forward with the hearings even as the coronavirus has infected members of the committee.

Still, Republicans expect Ms. Harris to be among the most outspoken against the nomination, given her prominent political role and their memory of her participation in Justice Kavanaugh’s hearing and other Senate confirmation battles.

After her selection by Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump accused her of being “extraordinarily nasty” to Justice Kavanaugh in her questioning. In the debate, Mr. Pence recalled that Ms. Harris had questioned another judicial nominee’s views because he belonged to the Knights of Columbus, an organization for Catholic men.

In a conference call with reporters this month, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, suggested that Ms. Harris would be under pressure to take on Judge Barrett at the hearings.

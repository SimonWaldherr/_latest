From “Laguna Beach” to beauty mogul.

In August, Lauren Conrad surprised her fans by launching her clean, eco-friendly, vegan and cruelty-free makeup line with five core products, all priced under $30: a lipstick in four shades, a black liquid eyeliner, three shades of lip gloss, a lip and cheek tint and a liquid highlighter.

Since then, she’s expanded her cosmetics brand to include two eyeshadow palettes, powder blushes, eyeliner and eyebrow pencils, mascara and even skincare.

Available in store and online at Kohls and LaurenConradBeauty.com, the products were “years in the making,” as the 34-year-old star of “The Hills” shared on Instagram. And with their minimalist pale pink packaging, all of which is recyclable, they certainly reflect Conrad’s famously feminine and classic aesthetic.

But do they truly deliver that gorgeous “California girl” glow? In our latest episode of “Style Trial,” two Page Six editors put the MTV darling-turned-designer’s makeup to the test. Watch the video above for their full thoughts, and see their top takeaways — and shop the products — below.

Editor’s note: Additional shades of select products were released after we filmed this video review.

PROS: The two-in-one product showed up on both testers’ skin tones, and was easily buildable.

CONS: The pigmentation is much subtler than what you’ll find from most cream blushes, and the glossy, tacky texture could be a turnoff for some.

PROS: This offers more color payoff than the Lip & Cheek Tint, and the packaging is sleeker and slimmer than that of most blushes on the market, making it great for travel or those on the go.

CONS: Since this product doesn’t come with a brush, likely for environmental reasons, you’ll need to use your own. Page Six Style editor Elana Fishman enjoyed the matte finish, but executive podcast producer Jamela Williams preferred the dewier finish of the two-in-one-tint.

PROS: Both testers enjoyed the smooth, almost serum-like consistency of this product, and the fact that it’s subtly shimmery as opposed to straight-up glittery.

CONS: At $26 for less than half an ounce of product, the price is a bit steep. Jamela also found the finish to be slightly too subtle for her liking.

PROS: Both testers really enjoyed these neutral shades, which range from shimmery to satiny to matte. The Sunrise palette, made up of beiges and browns, is a great choice for a subtle everyday look, while the Magic Hour one offers rose golds and purples ideal for a night out.

CONS: Conrad’s all about the earth tones, so those looking for bolder, more high-impact hues should look elsewhere.

PROS: By far Elana’s favorite product of the bunch, this eyeliner features a super-fine brush tip that makes drawing on the perfect wing a breeze. Both testers created their ideal flick on the first try — no small feat! Plus, the product stayed put all day on Elana’s hooded eyes with zero transfer, no setting powder required.

CONS: None.

PROS: A solid everyday mascara that didn’t smudge or flake even after hours of wear, this is a good choice for those in search of lusher lashes that still look and feel natural.

CONS: If, like Jamela, you’re looking for false lash-level results, you’d be better off going for a more volumizing or lengthening formula.

PROS: Both testers were pleasantly surprised by how hydrating and non-sticky this gloss, which is made with rose oils, felt on their lips. The nostalgic squeeze tube was a big win, too.

CONS: Unlike the rest of Conrad’s products, this gloss does have a fragrance. Both Elana and Jamela were fans of the light floral scent, but those partial to fragrance-free makeup might feel differently.

PROS: Another top buy in both Jamela and Elana’s eyes, this semi-matte lipstick is formulated with shea butter and grapeseed and argan oils, so it goes on smooth and is actually comfortable to wear. And while the packaging for all Lauren Conrad Beauty products is recyclable, this tube makes it especially easy: Once you’re done with your lipstick, it can go straight into the recycle bin, no disassembly needed.

CONS: None.

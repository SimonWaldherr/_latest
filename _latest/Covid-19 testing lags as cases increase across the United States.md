  Covid-19 testing lags as cases increase across the United States 
description: > 
  While critics of wide scale testing, including President Donald Trump have asserted that surges in cases can be explained by increased testing, health experts say that a jump in confirmed cases is usually caused by more people getting sick.And those experts, who have long urged that testing is a critical tool in the fight against the pandemic, say that the lack of aggressive and consistent testing has contributed to the virus’s spread.“Testing fatigue and mask-wearing fatigue is real.”Without widespread testing, cities and states don’t have the ability to track who has the virus and who is at risk of getting it, experts say.“There's still a dearth of testing,” Lipsitch said, pointing to colleges and sports as areas that are able to operate through the pandemic due to aggressive testing policies.“In places with higher resources, such as universities, you can actually figure out where people are getting exposed and infected.”

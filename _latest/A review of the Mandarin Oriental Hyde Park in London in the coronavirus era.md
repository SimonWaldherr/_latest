Fitness facilities and the pool are open, with guests asked to book 'slots' to control numbers and ensure social distancing. The spa reopened on August 1 with a carefully curated menu of indulgent body treatments aimed at relieving stress and boosting wellness.</p><img id="i-7d021947d73df299" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="640" width="962" alt="The iconic Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park was one of the first London five-star hotels to reopen, on July 17, following lockdown" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-7d021947d73df299" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/17/34578148-8855951-The_iconic_Mandarin_Oriental_was_one_of_the_first_London_five_st-a-48_1603123578403.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="The iconic Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park was one of the first London five-star hotels to reopen, on July 17, following lockdown" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">The iconic Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park was one of the first London five-star hotels to reopen, on July 17, following lockdown</p><img id="i-d1103138a304c319" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="640" width="962" alt="MailOnline Travel's Ian Walker checked in with his wife to the Hyde Park property and remarks that the legendary service is still there, despite coronavirus tweaks" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-d1103138a304c319" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/17/34578142-8855951-image-a-49_1603123578404.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="MailOnline Travel's Ian Walker checked in with his wife to the Hyde Park property and remarks that the legendary service is still there, despite coronavirus tweaks" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">MailOnline Travel's Ian Walker checked in with his wife to the Hyde Park property and remarks that the legendary service is still there, despite coronavirus tweaks</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The legendary service is as top-notch as ever, as I discovered on a recent visit with my wife to see how the hotel is coping in the hospitality fight-back against Covid-19. Conscientious staff manage that difficult balancing act of avoiding 'hovering', but always being available when needed, even succeeding in conveying efficiency, confidence and good humour through the confines of a mask. Discreet containers of hand sanitiser are available in all the public spaces where guests are also required to wear masks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surprisingly these added precautions, fast becoming de rigueur in the hospitality industry, do not detract from all this hotel has to offer, but rather concentrate the mind on enjoying the freedoms and facilities still available.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first time, the lovely garden terrace looking on to the park is open for al fresco lunch and drinks until 6pm and the celebrated two-Michelin-starred Dinner by Heston Blumenthal restaurant is open for lunch and dinner. With its 'theatre' kitchen situated behind floor-to-ceiling glass walls and views over Hyde Park, once the favoured hunting grounds of Henry VIII, the setting is full of human energy on one side and the natural movement of flora and fauna on the other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We arrived in time for dinner, an experience as much as a meal, with a menu inspired by history and perfected by modern culinary techniques.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Heston's acclaimed Meat Fruit does not disappoint - a feast for the eyes in the form of a mandarin orange complete with stalk and leaves, which is actually an intensely flavoured orange jelly, coating a chicken liver parfait, the tang of the fruit creating a perfect marriage with the creamy richness of the parfait.</p><img id="i-46053e3989cacc52" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="640" width="962" alt="The celebrated two-Michelin-starred Dinner by Heston Blumenthal restaurant, pictured, is open for lunch and dinner" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-46053e3989cacc52" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/17/34578158-8855951-image-a-50_1603123578405.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="The celebrated two-Michelin-starred Dinner by Heston Blumenthal restaurant, pictured, is open for lunch and dinner" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">The celebrated two-Michelin-starred Dinner by Heston Blumenthal restaurant, pictured, is open for lunch and dinner</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Smoked Pickled Mussels may not have been as visually striking but was also delicious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A fillet of Hereford beef, dry-aged for a minimum of 21 days with mushroom ketchup and triple cooked chips is a gloriously simple dish which belied the skill required to ensure it tasted as good as it did.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rows of spit-roasting pineapples were on show in the kitchen, destined to adorn Heston's much-admired Tipsy Cake dessert, but my wife assured me the Blackberry Tart, a saffron cake with jersey cream and pickled blackberries, deserved just as much attention and I can attest to the success of the Brown Bread Ice Cream with salted butter caramel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hotel underwent a huge renovation, completed last year, and fabulous Joyce Wang interiors have given the 181 guest rooms, including 40 suites, a soft and light feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our Hyde Park Suite was no exception.</p><img id="i-65103d8f6aa26f73" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="681" width="962" alt="The hotel underwent a huge renovation, completed last year, and fabulous Joyce Wang interiors have given the 181 guest rooms, including 40 suites, a soft and light feel, writes Ian.

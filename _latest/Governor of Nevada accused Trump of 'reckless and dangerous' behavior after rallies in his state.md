  Governor of Nevada accused Trump of 'reckless and dangerous' behavior after rallies in his state 
description: > 
  Donald Trump was told on Sunday night that he was not welcome in the state of Nevada, after the Democrat governor described his guest as indulging in 'reckless and dangerous' behavior during the coronavirus pandemic.Steve Sisolak, the first Democrat to govern Nevada since 1999, on Sunday night was fiercely critical of Trump.'And right now, that responsibility includes telling the President of the United States that hosting a large gathering without adhering to guidance from his own @CDCgov & requirements developed by State health officials is reckless & dangerous.That is the highest it has been since 8.6 per cent on September 5, according to the weekly Nevada Health Response Situation Report released on Friday.The World Health Organization recommends a rate of 5 per cent or below - a rate Nevada has not dropped below since mid-June.

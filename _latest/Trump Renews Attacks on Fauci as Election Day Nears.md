<div><p>President Donald Trump on Monday <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-07-13/white-house-targets-fauci-as-coronavirus-cases-surge">renewed</a> attacks on leading infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci with just over two weeks to go until Election Day. </p><p>"Dr.Tony Fauci says we don't allow him to do television, and yet I saw him last night on [60 Minutes], and he seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope," Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1318252736538767360">tweeted</a>. "All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions. He said 'no masks &amp; let China in'. Also, Bad arm!" </p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Photos: Daily Life, Disrupted</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/a0eb38c/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F29%2Fad%2F7c51afd846059305620685f70460%2Fcoronavirus-03.JPG" alt="TOPSHOT - A passenger in an outfit (R) poses for a picture as a security guard wearing a facemask as a preventive measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus stands nearby on a last century-style boat, featuring a theatrical drama set between the 1920s and 1930s in Wuhan, in Chinas central Hubei province on September 27, 2020.

The president was said to have bristled at the attention given to Fauci, who has steadfastly refused to respond to a series of slights and snubs from Trump over the course of the pandemic.</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>Fauci told "60 Minutes" on Sunday that the White House has blocked him from appearing on shows that have requested to interview him during the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>"I certainly have not been allowed to go on many, many, many shows that have asked for me," Fauci said. </p><p>Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in the wide-ranging interview that he thinks Trump's messaging against him during the pandemic is more about making a statement than being "anti-science."</p><p>"I think deep down, he believes in science. If he didn't, he would not have entrusted his health to the very competent physicians at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center," Fauci said about Trump's recent hospitalization while battling the coronavirus. </p><p>But Trump had harsher words to say during a phone call with campaign staff earlier on Monday that was reported by multiple news outlets, calling Fauci a "disaster."</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots &#8211; these people, these people that have gotten it wrong," Trump said, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fauci-says-he-s-not-surprised-trump-contracted-covid-19-n1243857">NBC News</a>.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>The president said that if he had followed Fauci's advice, "we'd have 500,000 deaths," before upping that number to "700-800,000 deaths."</p><p>"Fauci's a nice guy. He's been here for 500 years. He called every one of them wrong," Trump said. </p><p>The coronavirus, which has infected over 8.2 million Americans and killed more than 220,000, has become a top issue as the election nears. </p><p>Trump, who is lagging behind former Vice President Joe Biden in national polling, said on the campaign call that "people are tired of COVID."</p><p>"Yup, there's going to be spikes, there's going to be no spikes, there's going to be vaccines. With or without vaccines, people are tired of COVID," Trump said, according to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/521702-trump-labels-fauci-a-disaster-on-campaign-call">The Hill</a>. "I have the biggest rallies I have ever had and we have COVID. People are saying, 'Whatever, just leave us alone.' They're tired of it."</p><p>Nevertheless, polling shows that the handling of the virus is among voters' biggest complaints about Trump &#8211; one he appeared to try to address in a recent campaign advertisement that drew a rare rebuke from Fauci for mischaracterizing comments from him in a manner that could have implied an endorsement of the president's response to the pandemic.</p><p>Trump's attacks led Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee to defend Fauci on Twitter, calling him "one of our country's most distinguished public servants."</p><p>"He has served 6 presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan. If more Americans paid attention to his advice, we'd have fewer cases of COVID-19, &amp; it would be safer to go back to school &amp; back to work &amp; out to eat," Alexander <a href="https://twitter.com/SenAlexander/status/1318259834437906439">tweeted</a>. <br></p></div>

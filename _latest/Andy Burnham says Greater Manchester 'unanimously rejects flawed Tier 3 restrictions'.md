Andy Burnham has said Greater Manchester leaders have "unanimously rejected" taking the city into a Tier 3 lockdown.

The Mayor of Greater Manchester said the measures proposed for the city went "way beyond" the closure of pubs.

The Liverpool city region is currently the only part of England under Tier 3 - the strictest - coronavirus control measures.

Mr Burnham added northern cities will resist the measures without 80 per cent job support because they don't want to be the "canaries in the coalmine".

He said: "Today we communicated our clear and unanimous view to the Government.

"It is wrong to place some of the poorest parts of England in a punishing lockdown without proper support for the people and businesses affected.

"To do so will result in certain hardship, job losses, business failure.

"It will cause harm in a different way to people's mental health and is not certain to control the virus.

"Last night the deputy chief medical officer told the leaders that to bring the infection rates down any regional lockdown would require widespread closures way beyond pubs to stand any real chance of working."

The Government has been pushing for the region's politicians to accept Tier 3 measures, which would include the closure of pubs and bars unless they can operate as restaurants.

But local MPs and council chiefs have lined up to criticise the plan and the way it has been handled by Number 10.

Mr Burnham also accused ministers of treating the region as a "sacrificial lamb".

The mayor added that England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, had told northern leaders that a full national lockdown was the only real solution known to work, but Burnham said Johnson was unwilling to go that far.

Speaking at a press briefing in the city, he said: "I've said it may be that we need to look at a national circuit-break as preferable to this unfunded, risky regional lockdown strategy.

"We have to protect the health of the nation but let's do it as one nation, and not make the North of England the sacrificial lamb for an ill-thought-through Downing Street policy which doesn't make sense in the real world."

The Mayor said people are "fed up of being treated in this way, the North is fed up of being pushed around."

He added: "This is an important moment. Greater Manchester will stand firm."

He also set out the financial support needed if the "regional lockdown" being proposed was to be implemented.

"Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are being set up as the canaries in the coalmine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy as an attempt to prevent the expense of what is truly needed," he said.

"The very least they should be offering the people of Greater Manchester who will be affected by these closures is a full and fair 80 per cent furlough for all affected workers, 80 per cent income support for people who are self-employed, and a proper compensation scheme for businesses.

"So far, they have not been prepared to offer that."

Pub and club owners in Manchester say they have been left in limbo amid wrangling between city leaders and Number 10 over new lockdown restrictions.

John Hamilton, co-owner of Bar Pop in Manchester's Gay Village, said he may be weeks away from being made homeless if his bar is closed down.

Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said the Government was asking the authority to sign up to measures that its own advisers were not convinced would work.

He said: "What we were told last night by the deputy chief medical officer - and I will go a bit further than Andy (Burnham) - was that what we're asked to do is accept a proposal which the Government's own advisers say won't work.

"Why would we accept a proposal that their own advisers say won't work?"

Sir Richard said the region is "still in a position where we are prepared to work co-operatively with Government".

He added: "But we are not going to accept a deal that will damage thousands of people in this city region for no apparent benefit."

The number of coronavirus deaths in UK hospitals has risen by 108 as millions more people are forced into harsher lockdown restrictions.

NHS England reported 81 further deaths in hospitals, in Scotland there were 13, in Wales there were 10 more deaths and in Northern Ireland there were four more fatalities.

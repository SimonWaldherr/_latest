<p>Germany has classified the whole of the UK as &#8216;high risk&#8217;, meaning all arrivals must quarantine for 14 days,&#160;show evidence of a negative Covid test, or take a test on arrival.&#160;</p>
<p>The German embassy said negative results should be no older than 48 hours, or else travellers can undergo testing at several major airports including Munich and Frankfurt.&#160;Those who are tested must go into self-isolation until they receive their result.</p>
<p>The rules will come into force on Saturday.</p>
<p>This brings the number of destinations with zero travel restrictions for UK holidaymakers down to three: Sweden, Greece (except Mykonos) and Gibraltar. There are an additional 16 countries that British people can feasibly visit, so long as they can present&#160;a negative test result, or take a test on arrival and, in some cases, quarantine for a short period.</p>
<p>Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary,&#160;is due to make an announcement on the UK&#8217;s travel red list at 5pm today. In recent weeks major holiday destinations, including Italy, Portugal and Turkey, have lost their travel corridors, meaning Britons arriving back in the UK need to quarantine for two weeks. Cyprus could be removed this week after cases shot up.&#160;&#160;</p>

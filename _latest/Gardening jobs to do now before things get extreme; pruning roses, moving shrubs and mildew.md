<div><p>John Emms sent me a picture of a rose growing against a fence, which he rightly says has grown far too tall (well over 2m), and asks how and how far he can prune it in order to regain control.</p>
<p>&#160;It looks like a &#8216;Compassion&#8217; rose, a super-tall scented, pale-coppery-pink hybrid tea rose that produces its fragrant flowers, infuriatingly out of reach, on the end of ramrod-straight shoots, while resisting all attempts to be trained to grow horizontally like a &#8220;proper&#8221; climber (for which purpose it is often mis-sold). Popular in the 1980s (the pastel years, I call them) there are a now a lot of elderly specimens around in need of shock pruning.</p>
<p>I suspect the top growth of this rose has been regularly cut back, probably to prevent wind damage. This year, John needs to go further. He should identify the thickest and oldest shoots, trace them downwards with his hand and saw them out very low down.</p>
<p>This will shockingly reduce the rose height and bulk at a stroke, and force it to produce most of its new growth from below his cuts. What is left of the rose undercarriage should be shortened to a height of about 60cm. Yes, yes, I know &#8211; by this time there may be almost nothing left. But replacement growth will be rapid next summer and should flower (perhaps slightly later than usual) at nose height. You really can&#8217;t kill a rose by pruning it hard.</p>
<h3>Dear Helen</h3>
<p>My garden is plagued by powdery mildew and this year seems particularly bad. The list of plants affected is endless, but worryingly includes trees and a hedge. As my garden has matured, the mildew seems to have got worse, spreading from plant to plant. I never blitz with fungicides, but I do spray individual plants when I notice the dusty leaf-coating. Have you some words of comfort or advice?</p>

<h3>Dear Penny</h3>
<p>There are loads of mildew strains and they tend to be host-specific, so plants not related to each other may not be affected but may be susceptible to others. The real enemy, particularly this year (although it all seems like a distant memory now), was the prolonged heat causing dry soil conditions. The other important factor encouraging mildew is the overcrowding of plants, leading to a lack of air circulation around them.</p>
<p>This autumn thin out any crammed colonies of mildew-prone forget-me-nots etc. Dig up and perhaps split your older perennials and replant them in soil generously enriched with moisture-retaining organic matter.</p>
<p>Next spring while the soil is still moist, mulch around trees, shrubs and clematis; under hedges and over borders, and in summer give stems and foliage of early-performing perennials a regenerative cutback. You will need a ton or more organic &#8220;stuff&#8221; if your garden can&#8217;t generate enough: mushroom compost may be easy to come by.</p>
<p>Lastly, systemic fungicides work best if they are used preventively, so spray plants that suffered this year before the problem shows up next.</p>

<p>A Minneapolis judge has dismissed the third-degree murder charge against Derek Chauvin, one of the four former police officers facing criminal charges in the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd. </p>   <p>Chauvin, who was captured on cell phone video kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes, still faces a higher charge of second-degree murder. Chauvin's legal team filed a motion to have both charges dropped, but the latter was denied. </p>   <p>The dismissal will be stayed for five days to allow state prosecutors to consider a pretrial appeal, <a href="https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12646/Order10212020.pdf">according to court documents</a>.</p>   <p>Three other former Minneapolis officers &#8212; Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and Alexander Kueng &#8212; face charges of aiding and abetting murder in the killing of Floyd. They also sought to have their complaints dismissed for lack of probable cause. </p>   <p>However, Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill denied each of their motions. </p>   <p>Floyd's death sparked international protests calling for an end to police brutality and systemic racism. </p>   <p>All four officers have been released from jail on bond. </p>   <p>Their trial is expected to start in March.</p>

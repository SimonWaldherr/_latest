The finger-pointing has begun in Florham Park, less than halfway through the season.

Gregg Williams doesn’t believe his defense deserves all the criticism for its inability to keep teams from lighting up the scoreboard. But he wouldn’t say who does.

While acknowledging the winless Jets need to do a better job of holding teams to field goals and cutting down on explosive plays, the lightning-rod of a defensive coordinator said “a lot of it is not all defensively.” Yet when asked who’s responsible, Williams declined to say.

“Yeah, you’ll have to figure that out,” he said following Friday’s practice over Zoom.

It’s pretty easy to guess in what direction Williams is assessing blame, in his passive-aggressive way. The Jets’ anemic offense is last in the league in points scored (15.0 per game) and frequently puts the defense in difficult positions. Opposing offenses are starting on average at their own 31-yard-line, the 27th-worst field position for a defense, and the Jets are averaging 26:29 in time of possession, the third-lowest in the league. In a 36-7 loss to the Colts on Sept. 27, the Jets’ offense was responsible for 16 points — two pick-six interceptions and a safety — but the unit has only committed five turnovers overall.

Of course, the defense has been a mess all year, allowing 32.2 points per game (tied for the second-worst figure in the NFL), giving up the sixth-most yards (394.2 per game) and placing last in third-down defense.

“It’s not a very good number and a lot of it is not all defensively,” Williams said of his group allowing 161 points in five games. “But it’s not a very good number and as [far as] points on the board, we’ve got to do a good job with that and how you do that is make them kick more field goals, got to do a better job in field-position type things.

“As you see the scoring is up in the league, but it still makes me sick.”

They clearly miss safety Jamal Adams, who was traded, and inside linebacker C.J. Mosley, who opted out. That said, the analytics website Football Outsiders ranked the Jets’ defense 24th in the league — not good, but far from historically bad. Penalties haven’t helped. The discipline-challenged Jets lead the NFL with seven roughing-the-passer fouls.

When asked about Williams’ assertion that the defense shouldn’t be completely at fault for its poor numbers, safety Bradley McDougald said, “We have been put in some unfortunate situations as far as field-position wise.” But he otherwise didn’t echo Williams.

“At the end of the day, our job is to go out there and prevent points,” he said. “We just got to go out there and make more plays.”

It won’t get any easier. The Jets haven’t even faced a top-10 scoring offense this year and are getting shredded anyway, having allowed 37 points to the Broncos’ 28th-ranked scoring attack and 31 points to the 49ers’ 18th-ranked offense. The schedule actually gets tougher for the defense, with games against high-powered offenses such as the Browns, Seahawks and Chiefs. Remarkably, the numbers could get even worse.

A franchise record for most points allowed is possible. The 1975 team, which finished 3-11, gave up 30.9 points per game, and this unit is on pace to break that mark. But, according to Williams, if the Jets do set the record for defensive futility, the rest of the team should share in the embarrassment.

<div><p>A Texas woman died from COVID-19 while on a flight from Arizona, officials announced this week.</p>
<p>The unidentified Garland woman in her 30s began to have difficulty breathing while on the tarmac awaiting takeoff on July 25, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-numbers/coronavirus-updates-dallas-fort-worth-north-texas-october-18-2020/287-abe26317-407c-4539-95a6-3670b2a3ba44" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news station WFAA reported</a>.</p>
<p>The woman, who had underlying health issues, was administered oxygen but ultimately died on the jetway, the outlet reported.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what airport she was taking off from or what airline she was flying back to Texas.</p>
<p>Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Sunday local officials were previously notified about her death, but only learned that she died from the virus a few days ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know a whole lot,&#8221; Jenkins said at a press conference on COVID-19. &#8220;We may not know if she was aware she was sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenkins noted that the woman contracted the virus while in Arizona and said her case was a &#8220;reminder that there is no age restriction in COVID.&#8221;</p>

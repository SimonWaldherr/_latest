President Trump said Rep. Nancy Pelosi couldn’t pass “basic aptitude tests” after the Democratic leader of the House vowed to create a committee to study removing a president from office who is considered physically or mentally incapacitated.

Pelosi said Friday she would introduce legislation to create a bipartisan panel to work with the vice president on the 25th Amendment.

The president was asked about Pelosi, who as House speaker is third in line and could become the president in the event of a contested election, on “Sunday Morning Futures” after some Republicans suggested she be tested for her fitness.

“I don’t think she could pass basic aptitude tests, personally. I really don’t. I don’t believe it,” he told host Maria Bartiromo.

Trump said he believes Pelosi is thinking of forming the committee because of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

“I think she’s talking about Joe Biden, because to be honest with you, he’s the one that’s got the problem and it’s obvious to anybody that watches him speak,” Trump said.

Pelosi said she drafted the legislation without Trump in mind, but her announcement came just days after Trump returned to the White House after receiving coronavirus treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

The president and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the coronavirus on Oct. 1 – just two days after the presidential debate with Biden in Cleveland.

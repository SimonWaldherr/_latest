It has been a few days since Emily In Paris’ took over Netflix and there’s still so much to talk about. For starters, the ambiguity of the protagonist’s social media success, her love story with French hottie Gabriel and Lily Collins’ impeccable eyebrows. While we might not have much to say in the way of Emily’s meteoric popularity or what’s next for her relationship with Gabriel, we have something about her eyebrows and make-up in general that might pique your interest. Over the course of 10 snackable episodes Emily, a marketing expert from Chicago travels to France to pitch an “American perspective” at her film’s Paris office and navigate the city as a true tourist, one who doesn’t even know the language. The Darren Star show indulges in a tonne of cliches, plays out romantic arcs that will get you invested and packs in enough silly fun to make audiences lap it up in a single weekend. But if there’s one thing the show doesn’t take lightly, it’s French-girl beauty. Emily In Paris drops makeup and beauty lessons one frame at a time and fans can't stop talking about it. To unpack some of them, I had an exclusive chat with Aurélie Payen, the show's Parisian makeup artist and asked her all our French-girl beauty-related questions.

Payen delved into a walkthrough of crafting Emily’s look, her transition from ringarde to not-so ringarde and the showrunners’ notes. The result is a peek into French-girl beauty secrets, the make-up tips you’ve always wanted and of course, a tutorial on how to get Lily Collins’ statement eyebrows.

To begin with, what was it like working with Lily Collins?

"Working with Lily has been an everyday pure happiness. I have never seen someone so brilliant, passionate, hard worker, never complains and always smile from morning to night."

What were the instructions given by the showrunner on Lily's look for the series?

"The showrunner Darren Star and the Makeup Supervisor wanted her makeup to be minimalist to keep her beauty and natural freshness."

How did you go about defining and creating Emily's makeup look?

"I wanted the makeup to be light, fresh but still with a touch of colour on the lips to give it some character. We had some more dramatic eyes or lips for the special events. It became the signature of Emily's makeup."

What was the transition from Emily's American makeup to her Parisian makeup like?

"As Emily began to discover Paris and all the possibilities she had in fulfilling her dreams, the evolution of her make-up and style reflected those changes. First, she was already very feminine and had a sense of perfection. Naturally, as she spent more time in Paris, she became a bit more sophisticated and her make up was also a bit more intense."

Can you share your top French beauty tips?

"Take care of your skin, keep your makeup natural and fresh! Add some more dramatic looks at night!"

Can you share your top French wellness secrets?

"Taking care of your health is the best advice I can give. Hydrate your skin and lips, do a facial once a week, always put sunscreen before the makeup (at least spf 30/50), and don’t put too much foundation!"

Emily's eyebrows are a real stand out. Can you tell us a little bit about eyebrow products?

"Every day I used an eyebrow gel from Anastasia Beverly Hills (Anastasia Beverly Hills Clear Brow Gel) which fixed Lily’s brows all day long. Then I used Secret concealer for under eyes by Laura Mercier in 0.5, to highlight the shape as it was lighter than her natural skin tone."

What according to you is a "ringarde" (basic) make-up look?

"Sometimes the limit is very fine for make-up to switch to a “too much” side. When the makeup is too heavy, for example, or the tones are poorly associated ..."

What is your take on the world's obsession with the "less is more" kind of French beauty?

"100% agree! You can use makeup to enhance your natural beauty without hiding it!"

So there’s your answer to every French-girl beauty-related question you’ve had since you watched the show in a nutshell - keep things au naturel and less is always more. Emily in Paris might be a quick binge but the reactions are myriad. Here’s a hot little take that speaks of the appeal of the show and explains exactly why it’s trending on Netflix:

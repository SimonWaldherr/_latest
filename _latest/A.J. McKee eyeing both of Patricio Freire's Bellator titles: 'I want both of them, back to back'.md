<div><p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/a-j-mckee">A.J. McKee</a> wants to go after <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/patricio-freire">Patricio Freire</a> not once, but twice.</p>
<p>The undefeated featherweight, who meets former bantamweight champion Darrion Caldwell in the featherweight grand prix semi-finals at Bellator 253 on Nov. 19, could cross paths with dual-champ Freire (30-4 MMA, 11-3 BMMA), if both men make it to the tournament final.</p>
<p>But McKee (16-0 MMA, 6-0 BMMA) isn&#8217;t just going after Freire&#8217;s featherweight title, he has his sights set on the Brazilian&#8217;s lightweight belt, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an easy fight,&#8221; McKee told MMA Junkie Radio. &#8220;That&#8217;s a warmup. &#8230; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking forward to doing, getting that first belt out the way. I&#8217;m gonna do it like Drake said, &#8216;back to back.&#8217; I want both of them, back to back. I&#8217;m gonna give &#8216;Pitbull&#8217; a little warmup.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been ducking me since day one. He acts like he doesn&#8217;t know who I am or what I&#8217;m coming for. He knows that time is coming, but I&#8217;m gonna make the first fight look so easy, he&#8217;s gonna rethink the second one or his ego&#8217;s gonna get in the way and he&#8217;s really gonna want the second one. It&#8217;s gonna be another cakewalk, I told him I got that leash in the kennel, whenever he wanna go to the pound, I&#8217;m ready to take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After stopping Georgi Karakhanyan and Derek Campos, McKee already finds himself in the grand prix semi-finals. Freire on the other hand, is yet to compete in his quarter-final bout. He&#8217;s scheduled to face Pedro Carvalho in the main event of Bellator 242 on Nov. 12, just a week before McKee competes for a spot in the final.</p>

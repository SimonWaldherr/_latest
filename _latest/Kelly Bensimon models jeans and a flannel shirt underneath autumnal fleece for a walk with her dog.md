She's frequently been seen jogging around New York City to keep her trim figure.

But Kelly Bensimon was seen engaged in a different activity on Saturday, walking her white poodle through downtown Manhattan.

The former model, 52, wore a black tank top under an open plaid flannel shirt in shades of blue, red and green.

The real estate agent and author paired these with form-fitting, hip-hugging denim bluejeans.

Bensimon's jeans ended above her ankles, and she slipped her feet socks-free into tan moccasins.

During her walk, Kelly also covered up in a white fleece motorcycle-style jacket.

The socialite also had an enormous dark leather satchel on her shoulder, into which she stuffed her fleece jacket to pose for photos on the side of a building.

Kelly's blond hair was down and parted in the middle, falling on her shoulders nicely as she smiled for the shutterbugs.

The former editor of Elle Accessories also had on a black face covering in accordance with current COVID-19 guidelines as she ambled along.

On Friday, Kelly took to Instagram to joke about the recent Vice Presidential debate, with a stunning selfie that saw the beauty in a leopard print minidress, sipping a cup of coffee.

She leaned on a gigantic red stuffed teddy bear, and was seen petting her white pooch.

She added a fly visual to the white fur of her dog, in a nod to the intrepid fly who landed for minutes on VP Mike Pence's hair during the debate against Kamala Harris earlier this week.

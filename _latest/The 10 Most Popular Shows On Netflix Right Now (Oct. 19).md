The show is also the most popular offering on Netflix regardless of format, the second week in a row it has held both distinctions.</p><p>The Netflix Original follows the 2018 hit &#8220;The Haunting of Hill House.&#8221; This new show doesn&#8217;t share a storyline but has the same spooky vibe, making it a good pre-Halloween watch. &#8220;Bly Manor&#8221; tells the story of a woman who takes care of two mysterious children in an old mansion with paranormal activity.</p><p>&#8220;Bly Manor&#8221; earned an 86% rating on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_haunting_of_bly_manor" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p> <p></p><img class="img-sized__img landscape" alt='A scene from "The Haunting of Bly Manor" on Netflix.' width="720" height="479" src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f8db4be290000ab06c6a3d5.jpeg?cache=dRZeQf2U5f&amp;ops=scalefit_720_noupscale"><p class="cli-image__spacer"></p><p class="cli-image__credit"><p>Eike Schroter/Netflix</p></p>A scene from "The Haunting of Bly Manor" on Netflix.<p>&#8220;Emily in Paris&#8221; placed No. 2 for the second week in a row. The consensus around that show now seems to be that everyone has checked it out but also concluded that it&#8217;s terrible. (Its greatest writing sin was definitely making fun of Lou Malnati&#8217;s deep-dish pizza and Chicago in general.) But terrible shows often do well on Netflix, so it will probably remain in the ranking for at least a few more weeks.</p><p>Notably the show &#8220;Ratched&#8221; fell out of the top 10 after being in the ranking since its debut in mid-September. Just last week, <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/10/ratched-48m-viewing-figures-ratings-netflix-sarah-paulson-1234598827/" target="_blank">Netflix said that &#8220;Ratched&#8221; was the most watched new scripted show</a> on the service all year.</p><p>Read on for the full top 10 list.

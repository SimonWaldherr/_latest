Or is it?" </p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>This is how chef Marcus Samuelsson begins his book, "Rise: Black Cooks and the Soul of American Food" written with Yewande Komolafe and Tamie Cook. The book challenges the notion that Black cooking has one monochromatic definition and puts the chefs who create it on their proper pedestal. The authors argue that there is no American food without Black food and offer over 150 recipes to prove their point.   </p></p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F201015213018-25-fall-cookbooks-2020.jpg" alt="You'll find seafood dishes in &quot;The Rise.&quot;"><p class="CaptionedImage__caption">You'll find seafood dishes in "The Rise."</p><p class="CaptionedImage__credit">Angie Mosier/Voracious Books</p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>The dishes were crafted as dedications to Black chefs, activists and famous personalities and their bios are throughout the book. </p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>There's chicken liver mousse dedicated to Eric Gestel, the lesser known 'Black Eric' of Le Bernardin.

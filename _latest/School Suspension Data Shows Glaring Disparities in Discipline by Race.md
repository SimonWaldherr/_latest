Students missed out on 11 million instructional days due to out-of-school suspensions in a single academic year, according to new research that details major disparities in how those suspensions are given to Black and Hispanic students and paints a portrait of an alarming and systemic problem with school discipline in the U.S.

The findings headline a new report from the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the UCLA Civil Rights Project and the Learning Policy Institute, which analyzed federal data from the 2015-16 school year for nearly every school district in the country.

"The focus on the experiences of middle and high school students reveals profound disparities in terms of lost instructional time due to suspensions – stark losses that most policymakers and many educators were unaware of," said Dan Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies and the lead researcher on the report.

The report found the rate of lost instruction is more than five times higher in middle and high schools than the elementary school rates – 37 days lost per 100 middle and high school students compared to just seven days per 100 elementary school students.

In addition, the rates for Black students and other students of color are significantly higher than those of white students. Black students lost 103 days per 100 students enrolled, 82 more days than the 21 days their white peers lost due to out-of-school suspensions.

As other research has suggested, the learning loss for Black boys and girls was the highest: Black boys lost 132 days per 100 students enrolled, while Black girls lost 77 days per 100 students enrolled.

Notably, the report details how state-level racial disparities are often larger than the national disparities suggest, with several states reporting "exceedingly high" rates of instruction loss for students of color when compared to their white peers. In Missouri, for example, Black students lost 162 more days of instructional time than white students. In New Hampshire, Hispanic students lost 75 more days than white students. And in North Carolina, Native American students lost 102 more days than white students.

Glaring disparities were also visible at the school district level, with some large districts reporting rates of more than a year's worth of school – over 182 days per 100 students.

"These stark disparities in lost instruction explain why we cannot close the achievement gap if we do not close the discipline gap," Losen said, underscoring that it's especially important to address now that the coronavirus pandemic is also accounting for significant learning loss.

"With all the instructional loss students have had due to COVID-19, educators should have to provide very sound justification for each additional day they prohibit access to instruction," he said.

The report, which is the first to capture the full impact of out-of-school suspensions on instructional time for middle and high school students, and for those groups that are most frequently suspended, comes at a time when congressional Democrats are calling on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to reinstate a slate of Obama-era civil rights regulations aimed at preventing schools from disproportionately disciplining Black and Hispanic students and students with disabilities.

DeVos rescinded those regulations in 2018, following a report of recommendations from the White House school safety commission, formed in the wake of a 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

The secretary argued that the guidance did a disservice to schools, creating disruptive classrooms where teachers felt unsafe because they were pressured by school administrators not to report students. But Democrats ripped her for basing the decision to repeal the guidance on an academic study that assumes Black students inherently exhibit poor behavior.

Last year, DeVos also recommended removing certain reporting requirements for the Civil Rights Data Collection that would prevent researchers from tracking racial disparities in areas like school discipline for early childhood education.

Though not the focus of the report, it also compared the learning loss from suspensions to the organizations' previous report on school policing, finding overlap among high schools with higher rates of lost instruction from suspension and those with higher numbers of security guards on campus. And in some districts, the report found, more than one out of every 20 Black middle and high school students were arrested.

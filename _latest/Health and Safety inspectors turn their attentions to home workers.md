Home workers who develop bad backs from working at their kitchen tables are being offered video Zoom calls with health and safety inspectors to check they are working safely.

Sarah Newton, the new chairman of the Health and Safety Executive, urged home workers to get in touch if they are worried about their office space at home. Millions of people are now expecting to work from home for six months after the Government changed its guidance.

In her first interview since taking up her position in August, Ms Newton told the Telegraph that HSE inspectors have not "so far" started to inspect people's workspace at home. But she said: "If people are working at home, they're going to be using the app for the internet, Skype, which is what we're doing now.

"So we can have those Zoom calls from, from our inspectors from our visiting offices and from checkers."

The HSE would then take up the issue with employers, she said.

"Once an employer gets a call from the Health and Safety Executive pointing out that they've had these concerns raised by their staff - action is taken.

“So if an employee rings us up with these concerns, then we contact the employer, we go back to the employer to say has something changed? If it hasn't, we go back to the employer until we get a resolution to the matter.”

Ms Newton, who was a Conservative MP from 2010 to 2019, urged home workers to contact the HSE's helpline if they felt they were not working in a safe environment.

She said: "Anybody who's got any concern can call our helpline, whether you're a home worker or not.

"They will then listen you know to the people answering the phone, listen to them very carefully. their concerns, and then, if necessary, will raise that with their employer.

"You can be completely anonymous, we understand that people might be very nervous about people taking detrimental action against them."

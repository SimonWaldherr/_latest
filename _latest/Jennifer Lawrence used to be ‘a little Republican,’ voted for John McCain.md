<p>The Oscar-winning actress, 30, said <a href="https://absolutelynot.libsyn.com/jennifer-lawrence-shes-got-an-oscar-ive-got-sciatica" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the &#8220;Absolutely Not&#8221; podcast</a> that she was a Republican before President Trump entered the White House.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up Republican. My first time voting, I voted for John McCain,&#8221; she shared of the 2008 presidential election. &#8220;I was a little Republican.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawrence, who was raised in Kentucky, said she saw &#8220;the fiscal benefits of some of the Republican policies&#8221; but eventually realized the party&#8217;s social policies didn&#8217;t align with her views, so she &#8220;changed [her] politics based on the things [she] learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what really &#8220;changed everything&#8221; for the &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook&#8221; actress was Trump&#8217;s election.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an impeached president who&#8217;s broken many laws, and has refused to condemn white supremacy, and it feels like there has been a line drawn in the sand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right &#8230; it just changes things for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the first presidential debate, the president failed to outright condemn white supremacy and told the far-right group the Proud Boys to &#8220;stand by.&#8221; In an interview with Fox News days later, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/01/trump-condemns-white-supremacists-proud-boys-in-fox-interview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he condemned both</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lawrence <a href="https://vmagazine.com/article/the-thought-leaders-issue-jennifer-lawrence/">endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden</a> and running mate Sen. Kamala Harris.</p>

Chrissy Teigen emerged for the first time since losing her baby last month, as she made a grocery run with her husband John Legend and their kids.

The model and TV host, 34, collected balloons for Halloween while at the shop, in a trip that came just hours before her husband, 41, shared a touching post on Instagram detailing his love for his wife in the face of their loss.

Sharing a video of his performance of Never Break from Wednesday night's Billboard Awards, he added a lengthy caption about the model, including the words: 'We’ve experienced the highest highs and lowest lows together. Watching you carry our children has been so moving and humbling...

'I’m in awe of the strength you’ve shown through the most challenging moments. What a gift it is to be able to bring life into the world. We’ve experienced the miracle, the power and joy of this gift, and now we’ve deeply felt its inherent fragility.'

During their first joint outing, John and Chrissy stocked up on seasonal items including pumpkin balloons. John pushed a cart loaded with purchases to their car. Chrissy was they seen with the couple's son Miles, two.

Chrissy and John tied the knot in Italy back in September of 2013, and conceived Miles and daughter Luna, four, through IVF treatment, while their third pregnancy occurred naturally and was a surprise.

Chrissy announced the loss of her third baby in late September. Just weeks earlier, the pair had revealed in John's Wild music video that they were expecting again.

After his Billboards performance, John shared the beautiful note with his fans about his wife and the excruciatingly trying time in their lives.

'It’s a club no one wants to be a part of, but it’s comforting to know we’re not alone. I’m sure Chrissy will have much more to say about this when she’s ready. But just know we’re grateful and we’re sending love to all of you and your families.

Deep pain: She wrote on Instagram: 'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before'

In their original post in September, Chrissy wrote on Instagram: 'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before...

We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn’t enough.

'We never decide on our babies’ names until the last possible moment after they’re born, just before we leave the hospital. But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack. So he will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever.

'To our Jack - I’m so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn’t give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you.'

Big news: The couple previously announced their pregnancy in John's Wild music video, which dropped in August

Bed rest: The Chrissy's Court star was previously put on bed rest, before she was hospitalized for excessive bleeding from her placenta

Difficult pregnancy: She explained on her Instagram Story: 'It's always been kind of the bad part of my pregnancies with Luna. With Miles, it just stopped feeding him. It stopped taking care of him'

She added: 'We are so grateful for the life we have, for our wonderful babies Luna and Miles, for all the amazing things we’ve been able to experience. But everyday can’t be full of sunshine. On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it.'

The Cravings cookbook author was previously put on bed rest, before she was hospitalized for excessive bleeding from her placenta.

She explained on her Instagram Story: 'It's always been kind of the bad part of my pregnancies with Luna. With Miles, it just stopped feeding him. It stopped taking care of him.

'I was stealing all his food because I was getting huge but he wasn't getting big at all, so he had to come out early and Luna had to come out early. I was induced both times.'

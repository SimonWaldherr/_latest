The Detroit Red Wings are expected to sign veteran forward Bobby Ryan, who was recently bought out by the Ottawa Senators. Ryan will sign a one-year deal worth $1MM according to Craig Custance of The Athletic.

Ryan, 33, was the Masterton Trophy winner this season after coming back from the Player Assistance Program as he dealt with alcohol abuse. His return to Ottawa was one of the most emotional moments of the season as he recorded a hat-trick, earning several standing ovations from the crowd and huge celebrations from his teammates.

A beloved locker room presence, Ryan will try to get his career back on track in Detroit. Carrying a cap hit of $7MM in Ottawa was just no longer possible, but perhaps there is still some hockey left in the former 30-goal man.

For Detroit, this is a perfect signing that could potentially give them a trade chip at the deadline. Give Ryan some prime minutes next in the top-six and powerplay, then flip him to a contender a few months into the season.

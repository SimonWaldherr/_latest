  US election: Where do voters stand on the key issues with just days to go? 
description: > 
  On Thursday night, Donald Trump and Joe Biden will face each other one last time in the final presidential debate before the US election.The debate, at Belmont University in Nashville, offers the two candidates a final chance to make their case to voters before November 3.The first head-to-head between the pair was characterised by hostile exchanges and personal insults, with Mr Trump criticised for interrupting Mr Biden during his speaking slot.Will the final showcase have any impact on voter behaviour, or have too many people already made up their mind for it to make any tangible difference?The US is starkly divided across partisan lines, with the chasm between party supporters on an ideological scale the widest it has been for decades under the Trump administration.

Hospitals in Liverpool have 90% of their intensive care capacity taken up by Covid patients and wards are almost at the level of occupancy at the peak of the epidemic, an expert in outbreak medicine has warned.

Prof Calum Semple from the University of Liverpool told BBC Breakfast that he was predicting "quite a dire situation within a week or so" for the city, because measures taken now will not have any effect for about 10 days.

"We’re not even into winter yet and the system is stressed by so many cases," he said. Many NHS staff are off work due to sickness and burnout and the region also faces pressure on other services such as education, fire services, food and fuel deliveries due to illness.

Prof Semple said that in his view Manchester also qualified for the "very high" alert measures, along with several other regions.

Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson told the BBC that many business owners had been "moved to tears and are telling us they simply can’t cope", with some saying they will never reopen after being forced to close.

In addition to pubs and bars, betting shops, gyms, leisure centres and casinos are also closed in the region.

Mr Anderson said he was told "forget about it" when he asked for extra financial support. "It’s not acceptable," he said.

Cardi B and Offset might take the title for friendliest celebrity divorce.

The “WAP” rapper, 28, revealed that she happened to be in bed with her estranged husband when she accidentally posted her nude photo to Instagram.

“I’m leaning in the f–king bed, right? And I’m telling Offset, ‘Yo I feel like…,” she said before explaining how her topless photo ended up on her Instagram Story (via StyleCaster). “I’m taking the f–king picture and then I f–king press and I see that it’s loading and I’m like ‘Oh my God! Oh my God, Offset! Oh my God, the picture’s loading,’ and he was like, ‘Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.’”

Cardi then explained that she asked the Migos rapper, 28, to check her Instagram Story from his phone to see if she had, in fact, posted the NSFW picture for the masses to see. He confirmed that she posted a “picture of the f–king tit!”

The “Bodak Yellow” rapper continued, “By the time I turned my phone on and deleted that s–t, everybody and their mom saw. They were all over the internet.”

Following the leak, Cardi addressed the accident on Twitter and decided she didn’t care because she used to be a stripper and many people had seen her breasts.

Cardi spent the weekend celebrating her birthday with Offset, from whom she filed for divorce in September. The two haven’t addressed whether they’ve reconciled but seem to be very friendly.

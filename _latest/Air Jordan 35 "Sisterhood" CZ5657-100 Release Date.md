The next chapter in the Jordan Brand line is finally here. The Air Jordan 35 pushes performance to a new level by combining elements from the Air Jordan 34 as well as drawing inspiration from the Air Jordan 5.

The Air Jordan 35 is already reaching a lot of love from the brand as the “Center of Gravity” and the fragment versions are releasing soon. In addition to those, we now get a closer look at the rumored Air Jordan 35 “Sisterhood” pair.

The colorway is inspired by the ladies who rock and represent the brand both off and on the court. The all-white base with blue accents and a gum bottom complete the colorway making it a must-cop.

Take a look at the rumored pair below as we await the official Jordan release date. Keep it locked on Nice Kicks for more on the AJ35.

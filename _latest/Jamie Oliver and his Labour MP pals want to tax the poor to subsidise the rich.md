No country in the world has tried to impose such a condition, and it is hard to see how it could be made compatible with WTO rules. But Labour has scented an opportunity. Here is a chance to appeal to several of its constituencies at once: anti-Americans, anti-capitalists, anti-carnivores and, not least, anti-Brexiteers, some of whom are now in such a state that they oppose any liberalisation vis-à-vis the rest of the world.

Hence the attempts by Emily Thornberry, Labour’s self-righteous trade spokeswoman, to frame the issue in anti-Trumpian terms: “All we’re asking for is that US agricultural corporations who want to sell meat in our supermarkets and school canteens comply with the same standards which British farmers have to meet.”

But this is not “all” Labour is asking for, not by any definition. Insisting on British production standards for “US agricultural corporations” would also mean imposing them on every other country. It would mean criminalising much of what we sell now. It would make impossible, not just a trade deal with Washington, but a trade deal with Brussels, whose animal welfare rules we exceed in a number of areas including calves’ bedding, sow stalls and the permitted number of broiler chickens per square meter. It would give Britain the most restrictive food policy on the planet.

Nor does it stop there. The amendments as drafted don’t refer only to animal welfare. They would potentially require food sold here to meet all our regulations during the production phase – on water conservation, environmental noise, the whole hog. Producers in poorer nations might find themselves banned from selling us things that we don’t grow ourselves, such as tea, coffee and cocoa.

Do the Labour MPs who imagine that they are standing up to rich Texan cattlemen understand that they are in fact standing up to poor African smallholders? Do the resentful Tory Europhiles who have joined them because they can’t bear the thought of Brexit succeeding realise that they are guaranteeing “no deal”?

Britain has been a net food importer since the eighteenth century – something that helped us become the richest country on Earth as our domestic production shifted up the scale. Our farmers, instead of trying to compete on price, became innovators. Our food producers can hold their own against almost all comers. We produce the world’s second highest-yielding wheat and the world’s hottest chilli. We sell wine to France, tapas to Spain, curry to India, vodka to Russia. Outside the Common Agricultural Policy, our farmers will be even freer to exploit technology.

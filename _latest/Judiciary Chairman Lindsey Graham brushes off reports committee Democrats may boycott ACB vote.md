Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican and Judiciary chairman, told reporters when asked about Democratic boycotts.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday a full Senate vote on Barrett's confirmation is expected for Monday.“The idea that the people who would be shredding norms here would be anyone other than Senate Democrats is laughable.Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., moved to adjourn the Senate on both Monday and Tuesday, and both days Republicans overruled.

Look, they have made a mockery of this process. Remember what they did to Brett Kavanaugh just a couple years ago?&#8221; Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked Fox News&#8217; Shannon Bream.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;So for them to talk about something being out of the norm of the Senate, it is hypocritical to put it really mildly. As far as their failure to show up this Thursday, if they do that, they'll do so at their own peril,&#8221; Lee continued.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Democrats have worked all week to make confirming Barrett to the bench as politically painful as possible. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., moved to adjourn the Senate on both Monday and Tuesday, and both days Republicans overruled.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>On Wednesday, Schumer put up a point of order, or a complaint that Republicans were breaking precedent, noting that a SCOTUS nominee had not been confirmed after July in an election year. The order forced Republicans to go on record for the confirmation.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p><p>&#8220;I'm forcing a vote that the Senate has never confirmed a Supreme Court nominee this close to a presidential election day,&#8221; Schumer wrote on Twitter ahead of the vote. &#8220;We aren't going to have business as usual while the GOP tries to use an illegitimate process to jam through a nominee to rip away health care from millions.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>We're focused here on the rewards and perks that come with each card. These cards won't be worth it if you're paying interest or late fees. When using a credit card, it's important to pay your balance in full each month, make payments on time, and only spend what you can afford to pay.</p><h2>Earn up to 3x points on groceries with Chase Sapphire cards</h2><p>From November 1 through April, 2021, if you have a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://oc.brcclx.com/t/?lid=26669545&amp;cr=28496&amp;last_updated=1599683586">Chase Sapphire Preferred&#174; Card</a> card or <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://oc.brcclx.com/t/?lid=26669554&amp;cr=26993&amp;last_updated=1586813977">Chase Sapphire Reserve&#174;</a>, you can earn more than the standard 1 point per dollar on grocery purchases.</p><p>You'll earn 2x points on groceries with the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://oc.brcclx.com/t/?lid=26669545&amp;cr=28496&amp;last_updated=1599683586">Chase Sapphire Preferred&#174; Card</a>, and 3x points on groceries with the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://oc.brcclx.com/t/?lid=26669554&amp;cr=26993&amp;last_updated=1586813977">Chase Sapphire Reserve&#174;</a>. You can earn bonus points on up to $1,000 in purchases each month &#8212; so you're looking at up to 2,000 points with the Preferred and up to 3,000 points with the Reserve.</p><p>The Sapphire Preferred and Reserve earn a place on our list of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-credit-cards-for-dining-restaurants-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best cards for dining purchases</a>, since they earn 2x and 3x points on dining, respectively, and thanks to this new offer they're now great options for maximizing your spending at the grocery store as well.&#160;</p><h2>The Sapphire Reserve's travel credit applies to gas and groceries</h2><p>Back in May, Chase announced that the $300 annual travel credit on the Sapphire Reserve would be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-reserve-pay-yourself-back-020-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded to cover gas and grocery purchases</a> as well. Initially, this was only going to last through the end of the year, but Chase just extended it through June 30, 2021.&#160;</p><p>Keep in mind the $300 annual credit applies to parking fees, tolls, Uber and Lyft rides, and more, so even if you're not traveling long distance you could find ways to use it. And now that gas and grocery purchases will trigger the statement credits, it should be even easier to get up to $300 back this year and next.</p><h4 class="product-card-heading headline-bold">

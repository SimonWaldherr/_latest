He's very fit and still relatively young. Pete finished playing when he could have probably carried on and taken on his role at Chelsea, which he does very well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We had a space in the squad and this year is like no other because of Covid and what it might do to selection and isolation. So it was an easy one. Pete will still do his day job but he's there if we need him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Whether we see him or not I'm not so sure. It depends how the season goes with Covid and isolations. I certainly felt it was a no brainer to have Pete in the squad for that reason and he can only help the goalkeepers we have. He's one of the best in the world in the modern era.</p><img id="i-444030619a56290" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="The 38-year-old has been keeping fit and is working with the club's keepers including summer arrival Edouard Mendy (left) who he is seen advising during a training session" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-444030619a56290" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/00/34639676-0-image-a-43_1603235276666.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The 38-year-old has been keeping fit and is working with the club's keepers including summer arrival Edouard Mendy (left) who he is seen advising during a training session" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">The 38-year-old has been keeping fit and is working with the club's keepers including summer arrival Edouard Mendy (left) who he is seen advising during a training session</p><img id="i-18bf74d3f60c1fa" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="429" width="634" alt="Cech had initially left Chelsea as a goalkeeper at the end of the title winning 2014-15 season" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-18bf74d3f60c1fa" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/00/34639684-0-image-a-45_1603235288402.jpg" height="429" width="634" alt="Cech had initially left Chelsea as a goalkeeper at the end of the title winning 2014-15 season" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Cech had initially left Chelsea as a goalkeeper at the end of the title winning 2014-15 season</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If we're in crisis we couldn't ask for anything much better than having Petr Cech around.

Deadline Day may have passed, but that doesn't mean transfer business is over for Premier League clubs. This year, the domestic window remains open until October 16.

With a host of Premier League sides missing the opportunity to sign their primary targets from top-tier clubs this summer, managers are now looking to snap up the best players in the Championship.

But which players are likely to put pen to paper with a Premier League club before the domestic window close? From Said Benrahma to Joe Rodon, Sportsmail have highlighted the 11 most likely players to make the move to the top-flight.

Premier League managers are now looking to sign the best players in the Championship

Said Benrahma (Brentford)

Potential suitors: West Ham

Brentford forward Said Benrahma established himself as a top target for a host of Premier League clubs after scoring 17 times in the Championship in a brilliant season last term.

Benrahma has begun the new campaign in the same vein of form and would have caught the eye of his potential suitors after scoring two goals against Fulham in the Carabao Cup fourth round earlier this month.

Brentford boss Thomas Frank admitted after that match the 25-year-old could move to a Premier League club before the EFL deadline.

He said: 'Am I confident he will stay? I'm confident that I would love him to stay, and I would love to have him.

'But I don't know. Honestly, if the price is right we are open to selling, but if not we will be happy for him to stay.

'Either we are going to get a top price or we are going to keep one of the best players in the Championship. Has he added a few million to his price? 100 per cent!'

West Ham were on the verge on completing a deal worth £25m for Benrahma but reports have suggested they may pull out and move for Bournemouth's Josh King instead. Regardless, interest in the Brentford star is expected to increase before deadline day.

Joe Rodon (Swansea)

Potential suitors: Tottenham, Leicester City

With the domestic transfer window not closing until this Friday, both Tottenham and Leicester will battle it out to sign Joe Rodon.

The centre back is a product of the Swansea academy and broke into the club's first team in 2018.

He has gone on to make 49 appearances in all competitions for the Swans, with all of them coming while they have been in the Championship.

Swansea have valued the Wales defender at £20million after rebuffing a shock bid from Spurs worth £7m plus add-ons earlier this month.

Leicester are yet to make an offer as it is believed Brendan Rodgers would actually prefer to sign Rodon in January or next summer.

However, the defender himself has made it clear that he is keen to play in the Premier League as soon as possible.

Josh King (Bournemouth)

Potential suitors: West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion

Bournemouth forward Josh King was close to completing a move back to boyhood club Manchester United in January but a deal never materialised. Tottenham had also explored the option of signing King as a back-up to star striker Harry Kane.

Now, West Ham are interested in signing the 28-year-old Norway international to bolster their attack this year.

As it stands, King is in the last year of his contract and David Moyes is looking to sign the £12million-rated player following Felipe Anderson's loan move to Porto.

West Brom are also said to be interested in signing King, but their presence in the transfer race has been dismissed, given their tight budget.

King's return to the Premier League could be an exciting one, having already scored 48 goals in 161 appearances in the English top-flight.

Josh King is attracting interest from Premier League clubs and could return before Friday

Ismaila Sarr (Watford)

Potential suitors: Manchester United, Crystal Palace

Ismaila Sarr has been linked with a return to the Premier League, with a number of clubs interested in the Hornets star following Watford's relegation from the top flight.

Manchester United were reportedly interested in the Senegalese forward as an alternative for priority target Jadon Sancho – who they failed to sign on Deadline Day.

The Hornets have insisted that they will allow Sarr to leave if his £40m price tag is met after he scored five goals and recorded four assists in the Premier League last season after joining from Rennes for £25m.

United may, however, face competition from Crystal Palace as the club are said to be preparing to make a transfer swoop as Roy Hodgson looks to bolster his attacking options.

David Brooks (Bournemouth)

Potential suitors: Manchester United, Liverpool, Leicester, Tottenham and Everton

David Brooks is another Bournemouth player who has shown his capabilities at the top level.

Brooks shone in his first season in the Premier League, following his £11.5m move from Sheffield United, scoring seven times and setting up five more goals.

Though a serious ankle injury restricted him to just nine appearances and one goal during the 2019-20 campaign.

Brooks has a number of potential suitors, with Manchester United, Liverpool, Leicester, Tottenham and Everton all interested in bringing him back to the top-flight.

Bournemouth are determined to hold out for £40m for their prized asset, insisting they are under no pressure to sell despite their relegation from the Premier League.

In addition, Brooks has two years left on his contract and Jason Tindall will be keen to keep him to help the club in their bid to bounce back to the promise land at the first time of asking.

Todd Cantwell (Norwich)

Potential suitors: Leeds United

Todd Cantwell has been left out of Daniel Farke’s last two matchday squads, fuelling speculation he could be about to leave.

The 22-year-old has been heavily linked with Premier League new boys Leeds, who are still on the lookout for a midfielder after pulling out of a deal to sign Michael Cuisance.

Despite the Canaries finishing bottom of the Premier League last season, Cantwell was a rare shining light for them.

The youngster scored a total of six goals in 37 games and established himself as one of Norwich’s hot young prospects.

The Norfolk-born Cantwell came through the club's academy and has gone on to represent England at Under 21 level.

Although Farke has excluded Cantwell from his most recent teams, it is believed the Norwich manager is eager to keep him at the club.

Max Aarons (Norwich)

Potential suitors: Tottenham

Not only has Max Aarons attracted interest from Premier League clubs, he has also been scouted by the biggest and best from the Bundesliga and LaLiga.

The England U21 international became hot property after playing an ever-present role in Daniel Farke’s side last season with Bayern Munich and Barcelona both attempting to sign him this summer.

Those moves failed to materialise but a big transfer could still be on the horizon for Aarons with Tottenham reportedly interested.

Aarons was recently asked about joining Jose Mourinho's new-look Spurs team, but remained coy on his future.

He told The Athletic: ‘I just leave that to the people off the pitch, like Stuart or the club, to deal with.’

‘Anything else that happens or takes place; it’s not really in my hands. All I can do as a professional footballer is try to develop my game.’

Norwich's Max Aarons is a hot commodity and may yet still make a big move this summer

Terence Kongolo (Huddersfield)

Potential suitors: Sheffield United, Fulham

Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder confirmed his interest in signing Kongolo as a potential replacement for the injured Jack O'Connell.

A deal between the two clubs had almost been completed this summer, however, the defender's medical tests are understood to have raised concerns.

The 26-year-old defender has only just recovered after missing most of the year with a broken foot that required metal re-enforcement.

Sheffield United pulled out as they were worried he wouldn't be able to play at full fitness. They could still yet revive their interest in him if other alternatives cannot be signed.

Fulham have however moved ahead of them in the race for Kongolo and are said to be in advanced talks to sign him in a deal worth around £3m.

Michael Olise (Reading)

Potential suitors: Arsenal, Wolves and Leeds United

Reading winger Michael Olise has picked up interest from Arsenal, Wolves and Leeds United.

The France Under 18 international is likely to leave the Madejski Stadium after breaking through last season.

Since Veljko Paunović took over the reins this summer, Olise has played a more prominent role and scored a stunning strike in a win against Barnsley last month.

Olise, who came through the youth systems at Chelsea and Manchester City, is an exciting talent and several Premier League clubs want to sign him with an eye on the future.

Emi Buendia (Norwich)

Potential suitors: Leeds United and Aston Villa

Norwich's Emi Buendia attracted plenty of attention after creating 86 chances in his debut Premier League season last term - bettered only by Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish and Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Both Leeds and Aston Villa are said to be vying for the Argentinian's signature and could bring him in before the domestic window closes.

Leeds have a long-standing history with Buendia after the club failed to sign the 23-year-old before he moved to Norfolk in 2018. Marcelo Bielsa will be determined to avoid the same fate.

Norwich could however command a huge fee with Buendia still having four years left on his contract.

Troy Deeney (Watford)

Potential suitors: Brighton, Southampton and West Brom

Despite being Watford's captain, the long-serving striker is set to leave the relegated club this month.

It is believed the Hornets do not wish to lose the 32-year-old but are now willing to listen to offers.

Brighton, Southampton and West Brom are said to be interested in signing the Watford man.

Deeney may, however, sign a season-long loan deal with the option to return to Watford should they achieve promotion at the first attempt.

Child labor increased in the world's top cocoa producer during the coronavirus lockdown, according to a report in June by the Swiss-based International Cocoa Initiative (ICI).

"We conducted this operation this morning in the two major cocoa-producing cities ... and arrested the farmers who were employing them in their fields," police commissioner Luc Zaka said.

The children were shelling cocoa pods in a field near approximately 20 adults, Zaka said. Initially planned for May and June, the operation was postponed because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

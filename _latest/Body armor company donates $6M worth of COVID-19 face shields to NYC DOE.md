<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A Maryland body armor company is donating 2 million face shields to the Department of Education worth $6 million, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The firm, Hardwire LLC, said it made the contribution out of a kinship with New York City that originated with the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>CEO George Tunis said the company entered the body armor business after the felling of the World Trade Center in 2001 and has worked with city first responders ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Operational schools are the backbone of our economy and society,&#8221; Tunis said in a statement. &#8220;New York has the largest public school system in the country and the immense task of remaining safe in a fluid situation. &#160;It is an honor to help keep the students and staff safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>A DOE spokesman said classroom, custodial and kitchen employees will be given <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/01/first-nyc-school-closes-for-extended-period-due-to-coronavirus/">first priority for the shields </a>and that children with disabilities will also benefit from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our city owes a debt of gratitude to those, like Hardwire, who stepped up to help New York during this crisis,&#8221; said Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza. &#8220;These face shields will be put to immediate use serving students across this city &#8212; especially our students with disabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardwire said its face shields can be <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/29/de-blasio-on-site-learning-at-nyc-schools-may-pause-amid-covid-19/">washed and reused.</a></p>

  DOMINIC LAWSON: At this rate, there'll be nowhere left for our savings except under the mattress 
description: > 
  What this means in practice is that those with savings in banks would be charged interest, rather than receive it.For most people, the idea of 'negative interest rates' is like something out of Alice Through The Looking Glass, a world in which everything is weirdly inverted.Just like the ultra-low interest rates already in place, it is designed to encourage business investment, at a time of the deepest financial uncertainty and impending mass unemployment.I am not arguing that the Government should re-take control of interest rates.I suspect the politicians would secretly welcome the idea of any debauching of the currency flowing from negative interest rates.

Which amounts to paying to have a bank account. Or a stealth tax on savings. Either way, it is incendiary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For most people, the idea of 'negative interest rates' is like something out of Alice Through The Looking Glass, a world in which everything is weirdly inverted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However among central bankers, it has become a very real proposition.

Or, more likely, in a safe deposit box.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Actually, with the introduction of polymer banknotes replacing the paper ones, physical storage is a much more attractive proposition: these notes will not bio-degrade and they stack beautifully. But that would have the effect of taking money out of circulation &#8212; the opposite of the Bank of England's intention.</p><img id="i-39e4d57ddad64356" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="634" alt="Actually, with the introduction of polymer banknotes replacing the paper ones, physical storage is a much more attractive proposition.&#160;But that would have the effect of taking money out of circulation &#191; the opposite of the Bank of England&#191;s intention (stock photo)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-39e4d57ddad64356" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/01/34551622-8853633-image-a-35_1603067685360.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Actually, with the introduction of polymer banknotes replacing the paper ones, physical storage is a much more attractive proposition.&#160;But that would have the effect of taking money out of circulation &#191; the opposite of the Bank of England&#191;s intention (stock photo)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Actually, with the introduction of polymer banknotes replacing the paper ones, physical storage is a much more attractive proposition.&#160;But that would have the effect of taking money out of circulation &#8212; the opposite of the Bank of England's intention (stock photo)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Moreover, the reason why there may be some reluctance to invest on the part of banks is not because they are being perversely cautious. It is because the effects of the pandemic, and the policies taken by governments to deal with it, have been to depress consumer demand &#8212; and hence the profitability of businesses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The risks in 'forcing' banks to lend in such circumstances is that they will make unduly risky investment decisions &#8212; which, actually, is what led to the credit crunch of 2008 &#8212; and it will also encourage savers to plunge funds into gold bullion. Which is hardly the way to reduce unemployment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But all of this would happen without the involvement of any elected politician. The Bank of England has, as a result of Gordon Brown's decision on becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1997, autonomy in the setting of interest rates &#8212; this is what is meant by 'independent central banking'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Actually, the first Chancellor to advocate such a policy was my father, Nigel Lawson. But he failed to persuade Margaret Thatcher, the then Prime Minister.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his book, The View From No 11, he wrote: 'The advantages I envisaged sprang not from the illusion that the Bank of England possesses any superior wisdom . . .I was certainly not proposing to hand over responsibility to the Bank of England for it to interpret in any way it liked.</p><img id="i-4f7c33101ec3dd34" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="417" width="634" alt="The Bank of England has, as a result of Gordon Brown&#191;s decision on becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1997, autonomy in the setting of interest rates &#191; this is what is meant by &#191;independent central banking&#191;" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-4f7c33101ec3dd34" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/01/34551170-8853633-image-a-31_1603067482827.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="The Bank of England has, as a result of Gordon Brown&#191;s decision on becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1997, autonomy in the setting of interest rates &#191; this is what is meant by &#191;independent central banking&#191;" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">The Bank of England has, as a result of Gordon Brown's decision on becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1997, autonomy in the setting of interest rates &#8212; this is what is meant by 'independent central banking'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I had in mind a Bank working under a completely new statutory framework, with an explicit statutory obligation to preserve the value of the currency . . .unlike ministers who are subject to political and electoral pressure, central bankers would be largely immune to such pressures.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's certainly true that politicians in charge of a currency have shown themselves all too ready to debauch it. But it is hard to think of a more efficient way to make a currency lose value on the international markets than negative interest rates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, this policy was adopted by the Swiss Central Bank some years ago because it wanted to drive down the value of the Swiss Franc, which it regarded as too high for the health of its own manufacturers. That is, emphatically, not an issue for British business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am not arguing that the Government should re-take control of interest rates.

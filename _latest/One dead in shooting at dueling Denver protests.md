Police said they recovered a mace canister from the scene. Video of the shooting posted to social media appears to show a cloud of mace being sprayed right before the shot is fired.

The man who was killed appears to have been part of what was billed as a "Patriot Muster." The event page for that rally stated "BLM, Antifa, and related Marxist associations are assaulting everything we love and cherish about this country!"

In response, left-wing groups planned a counter rally which they called a "BLM-ANTIFA Soup Drive."

Due to ongoing unrest throughout the country and violence that erupted at earlier events in the city, Denver business owners were warned of the possibility of violence prior to Saturday's protests.

This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.

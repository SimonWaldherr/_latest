  (CNN) Senate Republicans are moving rapidly to bring Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination to a successful conclusion.During this week's Judiciary Committee hearings, Democrats provided little evidence that they would muster anything that would derail her confirmation.The ongoing vitriol that flows from his Twitter feed seems to capture his essence better than anything else.But as we reach the end of his first, and possibly only, term, it is important to also recognize the ways in which President Trump has transformed the political landscape and not just broken it.These four years will have enormous long-term effects, regardless of whether Trump is reelected.

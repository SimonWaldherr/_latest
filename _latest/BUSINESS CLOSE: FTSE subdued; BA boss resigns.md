The FTSE 100 was dragged lower by oil companies, which fell on a drop in prices, but the index still managed to close just above 6,000.

The UK-focused FTSE 250 had a better day, closing up 93 points at 18,167, and the pound held above $1.30, even though Boris Johnson announced new coronavirus restrictions.

The Prime Minister set out a three-tier system of local lockdown measures in England, including a ban on households mixing indoors in some areas, designed to curb the spread of coronavirus. There will be a press conference at 7pm tonight.

In company news, British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz has stepped down from his role as the airline navigates one of the most challenging times in its history. He will be replaced by Aer Lingus chairman and chief executive Sean Doyle.

The UK hospitality industry is mounting a legal challenge to the government's lockdown restrictions, aiming to stop its plans to close pubs and other venues to tackle the rise in coronavirus cases.

Eddie Stobart Logistics saw shares jump 35 per cent after it returned to profit thanks to a 'strong performance' in its grocery and consumer goods division, which has helped to make up coronavirus-related losses in other sectors.

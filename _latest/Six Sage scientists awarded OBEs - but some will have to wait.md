Sage has been repeatedly criticised over the timing and accuracy of advice offered in the early stages of the pandemic. In July, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt accused the committee of giving the "wrong" advice to the Government and failing to propose a Test and Trace strategy.

Cabinet Office sources said the Sage members had been rewarded for their "voluntary contribution" to the fight against Covid-19, as well as "vital work in other areas".

Officials are understood to have screened out nominations for figures who continue to manage the response to coronavirus and whose actions might be seen as controversial, focusing instead on community volunteers, hospital chiefs and frontline healthworkers.

The honours list does not include any scientists from Public Health England, the Government agency widely held to have underperformed during the pandemic, despite four scientists from Public Health Wales being given gongs.

A nomination for Prof Whitty was discounted at an early stage, it is understood, although insiders stressed that he and other leading figures would be considered for honours once the pandemic is over.

Those who did make the list include Joe Wicks, the Body Coach awarded an MBE for helping the nation keep fit during lockdown. The 35-year-old claimed a Guinness World Record after one of his online fitness classes was watched by nearly one million people, and described the award as a "dream come true".

Derrick Evans, known as Mr Motivator, has been made an MBE after creating online home exercises during lockdown and hosting a week-long workout to raise money for Age UK's Emergency Coronavirus Appeal.

The television star said he initially thought he was being "scammed" when told of his honour, adding that it was "wonderful to be acknowledged in this way".

Indian airport authorities literally struck gold when they spotted a man walking oddly — and discovered he had about 2 pounds in bullion shoved into his rectum, according to a report.

The GoAir passenger arrived from Dubai on Tuesday at Kerala’s Kannur Airport, where he tried to avoid paying an 18 percent tax on his precious nuggets by smuggling them where the sun don’t shine, The National reported.

Officials at the Air Intelligence Unit mined the stash, worth about $60,000, from the unidentified smuggler’s butt, according to the news outlet.

Another passenger on the same flight was caught carrying more than 3 pounds of gold, though officials did not disclose if that traveler had concealed it the same way.

On Wednesday, customs agents seized just under a pound of gold from a passenger who landed in Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, on an Air Arabia flight from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.

The gold was hidden in the traveler’s underwear.

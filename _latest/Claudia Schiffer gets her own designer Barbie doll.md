<p>Claudia Schiffer is the latest celebrity to become a Barbie doll, dressed in two designer looks inspired by ones the supermodel made famous and complete with her platinum blond waves, pouty lips and ultra-high cheekbones.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Barbie was the first time I connected with fashion,&#8221; Schiffer, 50, told Page Six Style.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;My sister and I loved playing with Barbie as a child; she was iconic. We had an attic where we created an entire Barbie world with houses, cars and even swimming pools. My daughters have since inherited all of our &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s Barbies including their fashion, furniture and accessories, to which they&#8217;ve added the current Barbies of today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiffer worked closely with the Barbie team to create the outfits for her mini-me, which she told us she chose because they &#8220;made strong fashion statements when I first wore them.&#8221;</p>
<p>First up, there&#8217;s an itty-bitty recreation of a sexy blue Versace gown Schiffer wore in the fashion house&#8217;s Fall 1994 show, with a corset bodice and semi-sheer pleated skirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Claudia first stepped into the runway, with her blond, long hair and the angelic face,&#160; the whole world immediately saw her as the personification of Barbie,&#8221; Donatella Versace said in a press release. &#8220;Two strong women who do not need to be empowered by anyone, because they have always been the makers of their destiny.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Then, there&#8217;s a replica of the black dress Schiffer modeled in Balmain&#8217;s Spring 2016 campaign alongside Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell, featuring an embellished long-sleeved macram&#233; top and a long skirt with faux cutouts throughout.</p>
<p>Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing called Schiffer &#8220;the definition of a supermodel&#8221; in the release.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the decades, she&#8217;s inspired millions with her distinctive mix of confidence, style and beauty,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Seeing her in one of my favorite runway looks was one of my proudest moments &#8212; and the Balmain campaign that she shot for me will forever remain one of my favorite memories.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Schiffer&#8217;s designer-clad doll might be a perfect representation of her high-flying fashion career, the blond beauty admitted that a Barbie modeled after her current outfit of choice would look quite different.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;A cozy cashmere jumper, pair of jeans and some flat boots by Isabel Marant,&#8221; Schiffer said, summing up her comfy quarantine uniform.</p>

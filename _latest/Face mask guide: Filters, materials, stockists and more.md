<div><p>The coronavirus pandemic has meant that face masks and coverings will become part of daily life. </p><p>The UK government and the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO) have both advised wearing face coverings in a bid to reduce the infection transmission of Covid-19. </p><p>Since 15 June, it has been mandatory in England to wear them while using public transport and in hospitals. Failure to follow these rules can result in people being refused entry and a &#163;200 fine.&#160;</p><p></p><p>The new rules mean that anyone travelling by train, Tube, bus, ferry or plane in England should be wearing a face covering. Those travelling by train will be asked to cover their face as they enter a station.&#160;</p><p>It is also required to wear a face covering when in shops, supermarkets, banks, post offices, travel hubs, as well as in the indoor settings where you're likely to come into contact with people you don't normally meet, including cinemas, museums, galleries and places of worship.&#160;</p><p>These rules apply to everyone, except those under the age of 11 and people with disabilities or breathing problems, or anyone travelling with someone who lip-reads.</p><p>In an announcement in the House of Commons on 22 September, the prime minister revealed that these rules will remain in place for six months in order to curb the rising coronavirus cases in England. &#160;</p><p>When it comes to hospitals, all visitors and outpatients in England are advised to wear face coverings. Health staff will now wear surgical masks at all times.</p><p>Uber has also made face coverings mandatory for drivers and customers, and is taking additional safety measures such as regularly sanitising their cars. Customers will also be reminded to sit in the backseat only and to roll down the windows for ventilation.&#160;</p><p>From 22 June, Scotland has made it compulsory for people to wear face coverings on all public transport too, including the Glasgow Subway, Edinburgh trams and taxis. Those under five and with certain medical conditions are exempt. </p><p>In Northern Ireland, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings in spaces where social distancing is not possible, but it is not compulsory. In Wales, however, face coverings have not been recommended. There has been continued debate over the benefits of face masks and coverings and how they, if they, work. To help make it easier, we have put together everything you need to know about them so you&#8217;re prepared and informed. </p><p>You can trust our independent round-ups. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections. This revenue helps us to fund journalism across The Independent.</p><p class="sc-pdkfH jjYIOP"><h2>What to know before buying a face mask</h2></p><p>The government has been careful to distinguish between face coverings and masks in its guidelines and has been clear that the general public should not be buying medical face masks, as these need to be reserved for frontline staff and key workers only. </p><p>Medical masks and face coverings differ in their effectiveness. Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/travel-outdoors/coronavirus-face-mask-covering-cloth-buy-online-uk-a9510331.html" class="body-link">The Independent</a>: &#8220;Many infections are spread by droplets, which are relatively large when they first come out as a cough or a sneeze but become much smaller as they travel through the air. The job of a cloth face covering isn&#8217;t to protect the wearer but to block the source of infection (what&#8217;s known as &#8216;source control&#8217;). </p><p>&#8220;The main benefit is most of your germs will be caught in it, making you less of an infection risk to others. My mask protects you; yours protects me,&#8221; she adds.</p><p></p><p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link">WHO has created a series of videos and infographics</a> to show people how to use face coverings properly. Before wearing your mask, your hands should be clean and while wearing it, you should not touch your face or adjust the mask. Doing this can transfer virus particles from the outside to your mouth and nose. Taking your mask on and off should only be done by un-looping the straps from behind your ears and once you have removed it, store it in a clean, plastic reusable bag and wash your hands. When taking the mask out of the plastic bag, touch only the straps.</p><p class="sc-pdkfH jjYIOP"><h2>What to consider before buying a face covering</h2></p><p><strong>Glasses:</strong> If you wear glasses, you should go for a tie face covering so you can adjust the fit of it so it sits tightly across your nose, or look for a mask made with a nose clip. This will limit glasses from steaming up. </p><p><strong>Facial hair</strong>: For people with facial hair, like beards or a moustache, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/FacialHairWmask11282017-508.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link">CDC</a>) has warned that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/facial-hair" class="body-link">facial hair</a> may interfere with the effectiveness of face masks. If you&#8217;re not willing to go clean-shaven, make sure that the hair fits inside of the mask. </p><p><strong>Hearing difficulty</strong>: As face masks cover your mouth, it makes it difficult for deaf people and those who have hearing problems and communicate through lip-reading to know what you&#8217;re saying. It also limits understanding based on facial expressions. If you or someone you know is struggling with this, London-based charity <a href="https://actiononhearingloss.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/General-comms-tips.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link">Action on Hearing Loss</a> has created an information card with tips for people with hearing loss and advice for the general public. </p><p>If you&#8217;re caught travelling on public transport without a face covering you can be fined &#163;80&#160;</p><p class="sc-pRFZy iIPyzR copyright">(iStock)</p><p>They include: reducing background noise as much as possible, writing things down with a pen on paper or on mobiles and using simple gestures such as pointing or waving. Face coverings with clear panels are available so people can read lips and expressions more easily. </p><p></p><p><strong>How often you&#8217;ll need to wear it</strong>: If you will be going on public transport every day, buy a pack of masks so you&#8217;re not washing just one every day to reuse. If you&#8217;re buying for your family, ensure that there is enough for everybody as masks should not be shared, in order to reduce the risk of transmission.</p><p><b>How it should fit</b>: For a face mask to be effective, it must fit over the bridge of your nose, past the edges of your mouth to under the chin, without restricting your normal head movements. You should be able to breathe comfortably while wearing it.</p><p><strong>Fabrics</strong>: You will also want a mask made in a fabric that&#8217;s soft enough to sit on your skin without any discomfort. The more uncomfortable you are, the more likely it is you will touch your face or fiddle with it. </p><p class="sc-pdkfH jjYIOP"><h2>Different types of face coverings</h2></p><p>Face coverings can be made from things you&#8217;ve already got at home. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/coronavirus-how-to-make-face-mask-instructions-uk-tshirt-bandana-socks-a9510506.html" class="body-link">Learn how to make your own face mask at home from a sock, T-shirt or by sewing with these easy steps</a>.</p><p></p><p>However, face coverings can also be bought pre-made online and in shops, as retailers respond to the increasing demand.</p><p><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=6091&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/809275527/leopard-print-face-mask-cotton-leopard?&amp;clickref=xid:fr1592238907277ebf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link"><strong>Cotton masks</strong></a> &#8211; These are typically designed in either a pleated or moulded design to better fit your face, and are lightweight.

If your mask is reusable, you will need to remove the filter before putting it in the washing machine. </p><p><strong><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=6091&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/813880709/liberty-face-mask-triple-layer-filter?&amp;clickref=xid:fr1592238907278gjf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link">Nose wires </a>&#8211;</strong> Some masks have a built-in metal or plastic wire that sits across the bridge of your nose.

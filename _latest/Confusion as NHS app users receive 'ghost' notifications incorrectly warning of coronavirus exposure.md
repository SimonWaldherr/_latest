NHS Covid-19-app users should ignore ‘exposure’ notifications that are wrongly leading people to think they may have coronavirus, the Department of Health has said.

People have been expressing confusion and consternation on social media after receiving ‘ghost’ notifications warning of ‘possible Covid-19 exposure’ in the past few weeks.

However, when users click on the notification it takes them to the app where there is no further information.

The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said on Tuesday the alerts were default privacy notifications telling users the app is sharing their information.

However, the message left users of the app – which has been downloaded more than 16 million times – worried as to whether they had an exposure to coronavirus and needed to self isolate.

One user, Tracy Chou, an app developer, said on Twitter: “So what exactly is one supposed to do with an alert like this about possible Covid-19 exposure? There is literally no other information.”

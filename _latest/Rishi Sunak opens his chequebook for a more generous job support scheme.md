  Rishi Sunak opens his chequebook for a more generous job support scheme

<div><h4>Will it work?</h4>
<p>It should certainly work better than the initial Job Support Scheme announced in<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/09/24/chancellor-rishi-sunak-unveils-new-wage-subsidy-save-jobs/"> the Winter Economy Plan a few weeks ago.</a></p>
<p>Back in the hazy mists of time &#8211;&#160;Sept 24 &#8211;&#160;Sunak, flanked by the bosses of the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry, unveiled the successor to the furlough scheme, in full confidence that the economic recovery would continue and so he could wind down his temporary support measures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he was undone by two problems.</p>
<p>First, that scheme was supposed to encourage people back to work. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/16/threat-double-dip-recession-looms-second-wave-hits/">Then came the second wave </a>and subsequent decision to ramp up restrictions again.</p>
<p>The second was a big hole in his own plan.</p>
<p>Under the original scheme, an employer would<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/09/24/sunaks-support-scheme-may-not-save-jobs-market-winter-chill/"> have to pay 55pc of a worker&#8217;s usual wages</a> in return for 33pc of their usual work &#8211; not a particularly appealing prospect. The Government would chip in an extra 22pc.</p>
<p>That meant it would make more sense to keep one worker full time than two part-time.</p>
<p>Under the new scheme, an employee working the minimum required will put in 20pc of their usual hours, receive 24pc of their normal pay from their employer, and 49pc from the Government.&#160;</p>

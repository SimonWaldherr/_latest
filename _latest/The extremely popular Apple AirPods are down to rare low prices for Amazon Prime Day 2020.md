Truly wireless earbuds, like Apple's AirPods, have increased in popularity over the past few years. Although they're not audiophile-level earbuds, the AirPods are incredibly convenient. These earbuds pair nearly instantly with your phone, they charge up in their little case, and they're super lightweight and portable.

Right now, you can get each of Apple's AirPods models at a discount. While the street price of these earbuds can be a bit confusing or misleading, even taking regular discounts into account, right now you can snag AirPods at exceptional lows.

Beyond the charging method, there is no difference between the two standard AirPods models. Both sets of earbuds have the same audio tech, the same Apple H1 processing chip, and the same design. The more expensive AirPods Pro, meanwhile, offer an updated design with active noise-cancellation technology. Regardless of which ones you choose, you'll be getting a pair of what are arguably the most popular wireless earbuds around.

If you're more of a Beats fan, the Beats Powerbeats Pro are also discounted right now for Prime Day. Typically running for $250, they're currently on sale for $199. We found that these earbuds are the best alternative to AirPods for iPhone users.

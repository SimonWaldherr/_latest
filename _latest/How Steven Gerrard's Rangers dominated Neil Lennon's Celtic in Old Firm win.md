<div><p>Ntcham was a passenger and rarely in position to affect play, McGregor was marked out of the game and Brown looked like a one-man midfield, helplessly watching the game happen around him. Celtic had more possession but almost all of it was short, sideways passes in their own half or around halfway. They&#160;looked toothless.</p>
<p>However, while Rangers passed their way through Celtic with some fluid attacking moves, both of their&#160;goals came from set pieces. Connor Goldson's first headed goal&#160;was&#160;the result of some poor zonal marking in the box, while the second owed much to&#160;similarly bad defending from the second phase of a corner. This wasn't a thrashing so much as Rangers taking hold of the match and refusing to let go, the match tactics suffocating their opponents' own setup and the players looking more determined, aggressive and confident throughout.</p>
<p>If Celtic's 3-5-2 works so well the rest of the time, were their problems against Rangers actually just down to player performance?</p>
<h4>Who wants it more</h4>
<p>Ex-Rangers forward Steven Naismith's analysis of the match focused on the players rather than the tactics.</p>
<p>"Old Firms are first and foremost about&#160;who wants it more," he explained on Sportscene. "I've been involved in so many myself as the underdog but you go out with that will to win and fight. Celtic looked more nervous than Rangers, and Rangers seemed in control."</p>
<p>Celtic had more touches, made more passes&#160;and attempted more tackles&#160;but Rangers made more blocks, committed more fouls, dribbled more often and took more shots &#8211;&#160;Gerrard's players were well organised&#160;but played with an aggression that Celtic seemed unable to match.</p>
<p>There is no question that Brown, McGregor, Ajer and the rest wanted to win but Rangers looked desperate to, and were set up in such a way that maximised their own talents while&#160;nullifying&#160;the threat of their opponents. Typifying the performance were Scott Arfield and&#160;Kamara, whose roles as box-to-box runners caused problems throughout, always willing to take a man on and carry the team up the pitch, with Arfield's five tackles the most attempted by any player on the pitch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Duffy's role as ball-playing centre-back made sense for&#160;Lennon's tactics but his ability to execute said passes was sorely lacking, punting the ball straight out of play while under no pressure on at least two occasions.</p>
<p>Gerrard's setup gave Rangers the platform to dominate but the players delivered. Lennon's barely turned up but were at a disadvantage tactically and the substitutions made in the second half were like for like, with no adjustments or tweaks to a system which had clearly been sussed out.&#160;</p>
<p>Even a&#160;slight switch to a 3-4-3 rather than 3-5-2 would have allowed Celtic to overload the wide spaces, as below:</p>

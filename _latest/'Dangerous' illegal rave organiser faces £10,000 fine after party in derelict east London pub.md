The organiser of a “dangerous” illegal rave which took place in an abandoned east London pub over the weekend faces a £10,000 fine for breaking coronavirus restrictions.

The Metropolitan Police said its officers found more than 150 people packed inside the derelict building on Wythes Road in Royal Docks on Sunday morning.

They arrived on the scene at about 9.30am after receiving complaints about antisocial and violent behaviour in the area, before breaking up the event.

The force subsequently released footage taken from an officer’s body camera showing a large number of people crowded together in the property, where a large sound system had been set up.

The Met Police said the rave "recklessly breached" the Covid-19 rules, which permit gatherings of up to six people.

The 30-year-old man who organised the event may now face a £10,000 fine, the police said.

Sergeant Simon Biggs, who was among those who responded to the incident, said he was “shocked by the event organiser's blatant disregard for the safety of those there”.

As well as highlighting the threat of the virus, the policeman added that the pub was in a “serious state of disrepair”.

Broadcasters who fail to retain older women could be found guilty of “double discrimination” under the Equality Act, according to Harriet Harman, as she lamented the departure of Dame Jenni Murray from Woman’s Hour.

The Labour MP and Mother of the House said women are “pushed out” of television and radio after a certain age, while older men are venerated.

“It’s telling that while Ofcom publishes the data on the percentage of men and women at each level of broadcasting, and that of older broadcasters, they don’t publish the data on older men compared to older women. They should, as it would show that women are pushed out when they are over 50,” said Harman.

“The provisions in the 2010 Equality Act that allow for claims on the grounds of ‘double discrimination’ have lain dormant on the statute book. They should be brought into effect now.

“Whether it’s a woman’s role at work or in her family, she’s not past it when she’s past 60. You know that and I know that, but who will say it in the future if there are no older wise women left in broadcasting?”

Writing in Radio Times, Harman said: “Once a woman’s childbearing and childrearing years are behind her, what is she actually for? Certainly not for broadcasting, it seems, where older women are as rare as hen’s teeth.

“As men grow older, their greater experience is acknowledged. They are something different, something more mature. But somehow the public needs to be protected from hearing, let alone seeing, an older woman. There are young (usually glamorous) women in broadcasting, but they face a cull at 50.”

Harman, the former Minister for Women, said older women feel they are better at their jobs than they were at a younger age, a notion that is “shamefully” lost on those who run broadcasting.

The status of older women on the BBC has been in the spotlight since Miriam O’Reilly successfully sued the corporation for age discrimination in 2011. She was dropped from Countryfile, aged 52, and replaced by a younger presenter. However, an employment tribunal did not uphold O’Reilly’s case for sex discrimination.

Harman mentioned the loss of Dame Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey from BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour - Garvey will leave at the end of the year.

The Labour MP was a guest on Dame Jenni’s last programme earlier this month, when she told the presenter: “We were the first generation who were not saying we were going to choose between staying at home and bringing up children and being a housewife or going out to work and prioritising a career, but we were going to try and do both. That was a huge social and economic resolution which was invisible to most of the broadcasting world, but Woman’s Hour...made the space for all of these issues to be discussed day in day out.”

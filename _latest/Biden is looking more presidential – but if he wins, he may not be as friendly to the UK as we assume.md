M aybe it is just my imagination. But it seems to me that the first week of October has marked a sharp change, a transformation even, in the presidential campaign of Joe Biden. Suddenly, he is behaving like a man who has stopped hoping and started believing that he can win.

The change is not about the polls, although these show that the Democrat’s lead over president Donald Trump increased after the first televised debate on 29 September, and again after Trump’s brief stay in hospital with coronavirus. The current aggregate of US polls has Biden nine points clear, though many show the gap much wider.

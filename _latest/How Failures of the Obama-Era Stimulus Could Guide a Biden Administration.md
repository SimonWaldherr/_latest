  How Failures of the Obama-Era Stimulus Could Guide a Biden Administration 
description: > 
  That will be true whether it’s Joe Biden or Donald J. Trump, and true whether or not the off-and-on negotiations over a new round of pandemic relief yield anything.Given mass failures of small businesses and continuing astronomical numbers of people filing for jobless benefits, the president will face a situation uncannily similar to the crisis Mr. Biden and President Obama faced a dozen years earlier.Mainstream economists judge that the legislation helped stabilize financial markets and start an economic expansion that would last a decade.But it also proved underpowered and politically toxic, with lasting consequences for Mr. Obama’s presidency.That combination of a weak recovery with the perception of wasteful spending helped Republicans retake the House of Representatives.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The person taking the oath of office on Jan. 20 will face an economic mess.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That will be true whether it&#8217;s Joe Biden or Donald J. Trump, and true whether or not the off-and-on negotiations over a new round of pandemic relief yield anything.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Given mass failures of small businesses and continuing astronomical numbers of people filing for jobless benefits, the president will face a situation uncannily similar to the crisis Mr. Biden and President Obama faced a dozen years earlier. If it is Mr. Biden who comes to power, along with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, he will have something rare: the chance to look at the lessons of recent history and have a do-over.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Obama&#8217;s first legislative priority, the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, shows what can go wrong when the government spends money on a mass scale to fix an economic crisis. Mainstream economists judge that the legislation helped stabilize financial markets and start an economic expansion that would last a decade. But it also proved underpowered and politically toxic, with lasting consequences for Mr. Obama&#8217;s presidency.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">It offered fuel for the president&#8217;s enemies to portray him as a profligate deficit spender. Yet it was also insufficient to generate a robust recovery; the unemployment rate the month of the 2010 midterm elections was 9.8 percent, nearly as high as it had been a year earlier. That combination of a weak recovery with the perception of wasteful spending helped Republicans retake the House of Representatives.</p></div>

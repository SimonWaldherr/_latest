<div><p>If <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> and <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/dustin-poirier">Dustin Poirier</a> are under the impression that their rematch would take place at welterweight, perhaps they should think again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because UFC president Dana White made it very clear Wednesday where he stands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 155 pounds,&#8221; White <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPZjMH1DXHo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told BT Sport</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m not putting on a friggin&#8217; multi-million dollar fight at a catchweight that means nothing. &#8230; That fight means nothing at 170.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, the status of McGregor vs. Poirier remains the same: Contracts have been issued for UFC 257 on Jan. 23, but nothing has been signed.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Kavanagh/status/1317204297789149189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet last week</a>, McGregor&#8217;s coach, John Kavanagh, indicated the fight would take place at welterweight, saying &#8220;to see them hydrated &amp; healthy at 170 will be fascinating.&#8221; That garnered a positive response from Poirier.</p>
<p>The issue, though? Both McGregor and Poirier are vying for the same thing: a shot at the UFC lightweight title. Current champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, who fights Justin Gaethje this weekend at UFC 254, said he&#8217;d only give the winner a rematch <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/10/khabib-nurmagomedov-conor-mcgregor-dustin-poirier-155-winner-title-shot">if the fight took place at 155 pounds</a>.</p>
<p>And the way White sees it, there&#8217;s no good reason for McGregor&#160;(22-4 MMA, 10-2 UFC) and Poirier (27-6 MMA, 18-5 UFC) to fight a weight class up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither one of those two are ranked at 170 pounds, and it doesn&#8217;t do anything in the &#8217;55-pound division if either one of them win, because they&#8217;re fighting at 170,&#8221; White said. &#8220;It literally makes no sense.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>That&#8217;s a different tone from White compared to earlier this year when, prior to McGregor&#8217;s UFC 246 headliner with Donald Cerrone at welterweight, the UFC boss said McGregor would secure a rematch with 155-pound champion Khabib Nurmagomedov if he beat Cerrone.</p>
<p>Even though contracts between McGregor and Poirier have yet to be signed, McGregor already <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/10/ufc-news-conor-mcgegor-says-he-accepted-dustin-poirier-fight-2020">stated publicly that he accepts</a>. And with that, White expects McGregor to keep his word regardless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Conor likes to play games. Conor plays games, and he does his thing,&#8221; White said. &#8220;One thing Conor doesn&#8217;t do? Conor doesn&#8217;t commit to a fight and then not fight. Conor fights. &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are gonna change now. This isn&#8217;t the same Conor back in the day. Conor&#8217;s rich. Conor is very wealthy. And I think that Conor is in a position right now that he&#8217;s just trying to make moves that he thinks are right.&#8221;</p>

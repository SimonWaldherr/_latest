The hired Pinkerton security guard accused of shooting a protester dead during a Denver rally Saturday has been identified as Matthew Robert Dolloff, according to police.

Dolloff, 30, is being held in a first-degree murder investigation in the shooting death of Lee Keltner, the Denver Police Department said on Twitter.

Police said Dolloff has not been charged but is being questioned in connection with Keltner’s caught-on-video shooting death in the courtyard of the Denver Art Museum during a “Patriot Rally” that included clashes with Black Lives Matter demonstrators.

Dolloff, a member of the Pinkerton detective agency, was hired by local news station 9News-TV to provide security during the demonstration, something the outlet said it has done for months while covering BLM protests.

The station confirmed Dolloff’s identity on Twitter Sunday.

The Pinkerton agency did not immediately return an email seeking comment.

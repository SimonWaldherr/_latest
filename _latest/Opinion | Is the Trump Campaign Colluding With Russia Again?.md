<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The provenance of the alleged hard drive is murky, and the F.B.I. is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/17/fbi-probes-possible-russia-link-hunter-biden-data-trump-ally-giuliani/3661895001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly investigating</a> whether it&#8217;s linked to a foreign disinformation campaign. Giuliani claims his lawyer got it from a Delaware computer repair shop owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, who says someone he thinks was Hunter Biden dropped off three laptops and never picked them up. Mac Isaac gave a halting interview to several journalists last week; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/man-who-reportedly-gave-hunters-laptop-to-rudy-speaks-out-in-bizarre-interview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Beast published the audio</a>, so you can hear for yourself as his story shifts over the course of an hour.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">If there&#8217;s an important story here, it&#8217;s almost certainly about Giuliani&#8217;s dirty tricks, not any wrongdoing by Joe Biden. Reporting on disinformation is complicated, because it&#8217;s hard to write about it without amplifying it. Still, this episode distills just how far Trump has dragged the country down in four years.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In 2016, the public didn&#8217;t know that Paul Manafort, Trump&#8217;s former campaign chairman, was passing polling data to someone tied to the Russian intelligence directorate &#8212; such a revelation would have been devastating. Giuliani&#8217;s relationship with Derkach, by contrast, is out in the open.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Last week Giuliani <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rudy-giuliani-says-theres-only-5050-chance-i-worked-with-a-russian-spy-to-dig-dirt-on-bidens" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Daily Beast</a> he thinks there&#8217;s only a 50 percent chance that his Ukrainian collaborator is really a Russian spy, and that it wouldn&#8217;t matter to him if his Hunter Biden material was linked to Russian hacking. This barely made a ripple. &#8220;It&#8217;s collusion in broad daylight,&#8221; said Murphy.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Giuliani probably can&#8217;t sabotage Biden the way WikiLeaks sabotaged Clinton. The Clinton leak was damaging because many voters already believed there was something sinister about her hidden emails. Burisma never stuck to Biden in the same way, so there&#8217;s less payoff in forcing it back into the news.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But Giuliani&#8217;s tactics aren&#8217;t any less foul for being ineffective. It&#8217;s hardly surprising that the president&#8217;s bottom-feeding lawyer has shown himself open to working with Russian intelligence. It&#8217;s striking, though, that no one expects better.</p></div>

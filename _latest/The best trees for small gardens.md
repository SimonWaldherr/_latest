<div><p>Most trees reach ultimately at least 23ft (7m) tall and although most &#8220;garden trees&#8221; attain 30ft (10m) or more at maturity, there are many examples that stay smaller,&#160;in all shapes and sizes, evergreen and deciduous.</p>
<p>Here's a complete guide to the best trees for small gardens, so hopefully you can find one perfect for you.</p>
<h3>Trees under 30ft</h3>
<p>Most gardens can find space for the smallest trees, under 30ft high at maturity.&#160;Here are three excellent examples that are great for proportion and decorative value.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cercis canadensis 'Forest Pansy&#8217; AGM, </strong>with large heart-shaped purple leaves, offers rich autumn colour.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>Cornus kousa 'Miss Satomi&#8217; AGM, </strong>with wondrous white early summer flowers followed by red dimpled fruits, reaches 18ft (6m) height and spread.</li>
<li><strong>Sorbus vilmorinii AGM, </strong>15ft (5m) height and spread, has delicate foliage with cream flowers followed by clusters of red berries that fade to white.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trees with a small footprint</h3>
<p>A valuable subsection of small trees are fastigiate (upright or columnar in form). They cast little shade and have a small &#8220;footprint&#8221;. Three good examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorbus 'Autumn Spire&#8217; AGM, 24ft x 12ft </strong>(8m x 4m), has white flowers, yellow berries and fiery autumn foliage.</li>
<li><strong>Prunus 'Amanogawa&#8217; AGM </strong>is deservedly popular being reliably narrow at 26ft x 13ft (8m x 4m) and carrying masses of semi-double pale pink flowers.</li>
<li><strong>Malus 'Adirondack&#8217; AGM</strong>, 26ft x 13ft (8m x 4m), has white spring flowers and little red crab apples in&#160;autumn.</li>
</ul>

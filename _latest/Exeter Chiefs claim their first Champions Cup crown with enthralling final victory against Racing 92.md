The only shame was that the Covid restrictions ensured no supporters could be here to witness the spell-binding action, as Racing hit back with their own mix of forward power and backline precision, spearheaded by the genius of Finn Russell at fly-half and game-breakers like Virimi Vakatawa, Juan Imhoff and Simon Zebo. But Exeter hung on.

“I'm a bit all over the place,” said Baxter. "I called my wife Jo afterwards and I told her I would definitely be home tonight.

“She was pretty emotional and it made me a bit emotional, we have been together a long time - my whole career and she has seen the highs and lows. It was a special couple of minutes.

"To start with she was just screaming at me in emotional joy and then we managed to have a few words and talked about the journey and it was a nice few minutes.

"It is incredible - an incredible story for these guys and this club. It was a horrible game to watch and that last 14 minutes went on forever, but we have seen it out and it looks like it was meant to be.

"It is fighting for every inch and I thought that was the bit we were good at. I am glad we went for it like Exeter and didn't just try and ease our way through as we would have lost, so I am glad we got through it.”

Such a dramatic finish could not have been anticipated when Exeter flew out of the blocks, scoring two tries via their formidable pack of forwards and showing ruthless instinct from the five-metre line that has dominated their success since rugby’s restart in August.

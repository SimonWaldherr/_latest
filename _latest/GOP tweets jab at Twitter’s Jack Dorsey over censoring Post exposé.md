The Republican National Committee on Thursday took a jab at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over his censorship of The Post’s reporting on Hunter Biden’s emails.

The bait to Dorsey came in the form of a nearly 9-minute video posted on the @GOP Twitter account that scrolled through The Post’s Wednesday exposé that indicated Hunter introduced his father, Joe, to a Ukrainian businessman.

“Hey @jack,” the missive read. “Censor this…”

The clip would allow anyone to read the report — which Twitter banned from being shared on the platform after baselessly claiming that “hacked materials” were used in the story.

Incensed by the gagging of one of America’s largest newspapers, Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans on Thursday said they would be holding a hearing Tuesday to compel Dorsey to testify about Twitter’s decision to block the reports.

<p>Rishi Sunak has hit out at suggestions the Government &#8220;hate Greater Manchester&#8221; during a fiery Treasury questions.&#160;</p>
<p>While crunch talks continue behind the scenes over a support package for the region to enter Tier 3, the Chancellor was grilled by visibly angry Labour MPs. &#160;</p>
<p>Andrew Gwynne, MP for Denton and Reddish in Greater Manchester, argued that the lowest-paid could not afford to survive on what was being offered.&#160;</p>
<p>He noted that the entire region - home to 2.8 million people - had been offered &#163;22 million by Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick, which was "less than the &#163;25 million he granted to his own town centre".&#160;</p>
<p>"Why does this Government hate Greater Manchester?" he fumed.&#160;</p>
<p>But the Chancellor hit back at the MP&#8217;s &#8220;disappointing tone", stressing that Manchester was being "treated exactly the same as every part of our United Kingdom".&#160;</p>
<p>A second Labour MP, Afzal Khan, who represents Gorton, then accused Rishi Sunak of putting up "insufficient support".&#160;</p>
<p>He claimed the &#163;8-a-head being offered to Greater Manchester was half what has been offered to other areas and asked if the Chancellor &#8220;wants to apologise&#8221; to those who have already lost their jobs.&#160;</p>
<p>But Mr Sunak said this was the "national funding formula" for all regions entering Tier 3, saying support has been "done on an equitable basis" for all regions.&#160;</p>
<p>Additional funding remains available to Greater Manchester, "which is why I hope they engage with these conversations constructively", he added.&#160;&#160;</p>

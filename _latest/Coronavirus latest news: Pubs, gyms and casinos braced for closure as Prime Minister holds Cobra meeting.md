Pubs, gyms and casinos will be forced to close and all but essential travel to and from coronavirus hotspots banned under new measures aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus, expected to be announced today.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson will spell out his three-tier strategy this afternoon with areas in England labelled as medium, high or very high risk, which will inform the "appropriate interventions" needed in each area.

Merseyside is expected to be among the areas subjected to Tier 3 restrictions - but there is still disagreement about a financial support package for the area should harsh measures be imposed.

This morning, the Prime Minister is hosting a Cobra meeting. At 11am, Professor Jonathan Van Tam will hold a data briefing. At 3.30pm, Mr Johnson is expected to address the House of Commons, and at 6pm he will address the nation.

The virus that causes Covid-19 can survive on banknotes, glass and stainless steel for up to 28 days - much longer than the flu - Australian researchers said on Monday, highlighting the need for cleaning and handwashing to combat the virus.

Findings from the study by Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, show that in a controlled environment the virus remained infectious for longer than other studies have found.

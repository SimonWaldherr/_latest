“We’ve all learned a terrible lesson,” said one C.D.C. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired. “As much as we want to believe we can operate independently of politics and it’s all about the science, it took just a few months to hobble our ability to steer the course of this pandemic. So we can pretend that the politics don’t matter, but we have been kneecapped.”

Political appointees of the president meddled in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, regarded as the “holiest of the holy” in medical literature. Equally troubling, agency officials say, is that the White House has muzzled the C.D.C., refusing to allow the nation’s leading public health experts to talk directly and regularly to the American people — a critical component of any successful infectious disease response.

The C.D.C. has made its own missteps. Sloppy laboratory practices caused the botched introduction of coronavirus tests early in the pandemic. More recently, the agency withdrew a notice on its website acknowledging for the first time that the coronavirus spreads mainly by air, saying that it had been “posted in error” on the agency’s website. The weaker version was later published.

Dr. Redfield has at times offered lukewarm statements in defense of the C.D.C., like when he told the Senate health committee that suggestions that the agency was a “deep state” were “offensive.” In an internal email last month summing up his testimony, he told agency employees that he had “shared my sadness over misperceptions regarding the scientific integrity” of the reports, and pledged that they would “not be compromised under my watch.”

The agency’s scientists say that is not enough. Current C.D.C. employees contacted would not speak on the record for fear of reprisal, but the sense of despair is clear. Many view public health as a calling, and remain at the agency knowing that they could earn much higher salaries working in industry.

One longtime C.D.C. scientist said it was time not only for Dr. Redfield to speak out, but also for senior career scientists in the agency to do so. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, has hardly been seen since late February, when she enraged Mr. Trump by presciently telling reporters that day-to-day life in the United States was about to change drastically: “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen.”

Another C.D.C. veteran scientist said he and colleagues were planning to look for new jobs if Mr. Trump wins re-election.

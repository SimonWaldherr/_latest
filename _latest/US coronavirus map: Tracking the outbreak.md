The number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 grows every day throughout the U.S. and across the world. The numbers on this page are based on the latest statistics available, which are likely far lower than the actual number of cases due to limited testing across the country. More than seven million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and over 200,000 have died in the U.S. Here's the situation as it stands:

The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 each day plateaued after reaching a peak in late April, but in recent weeks, there has been a new surge of cases across the country.

New deaths and confirmed cases of COVID-19 by day

While New York has seen the largest number of cumulative cases of any state, more recently the spread of the disease has slowed there and accelerated in other states, such as California, Texas, Arizona and Florida.

Some states that are experiencing rapid growth of confirmed COVID-19 cases are not among those that experienced large outbreaks earlier in the year. Here are the states where case numbers grew the fastest during the past seven days compared to the preceding week:

Each state has declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency, and many have implemented restrictions on travel, business and public gatherings. All states have begun easing or lifting those restrictions, despite the fact that case trends are on the rise in many places.

The spread of the disease in the U.S. exhibited exponential growth during the early weeks of the pandemic, the nation became the epicenter of the global pandemic, and case totals eclipsed those of other countries experiencing similar outbreaks.

A note on data:

It's important to understand that the numbers reported by agencies and officials don't paint a complete picture of the pandemic. Many people who have COVID-19 — and no one knows how many — are not being counted by medical authorities. Because COVID-19 can have mild symptoms or even none at all, many people with the disease are unaware they have it. Others may have symptoms, but be unable to access testing near them. Finally, local governments and other organizations count and update case data differently, meaning different sources of information may show different numbers of cases.

Sometimes, data sources or formats change unexpectedly, leading to temporary inaccuracies in county-level data. We fix these as soon as possible. However, if you see a problem let us know at coronavirusdata@usatoday.com.

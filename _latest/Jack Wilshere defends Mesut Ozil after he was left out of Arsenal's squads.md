  Jack Wilshere defends Mesut Ozil after he was left out of Arsenal's squads 
description: > 
  Jack Wilshere has leapt to the defence of Arsenal misfit Mesut Ozil, claiming he is the club's best player despite his omission from Mikel Arteta's squads.The German playmaker has been left out of Arsenal's official allocation of players for the Premier League and the Europa League which means he will be frozen out of first team contention until January at the very least.But Ozil has also found favour from former Arsenal team-mate Jack Wilshere, who backed Lineker's stance.'I've always tried to remain positive from week to week that there's maybe a chance to get back in the squad soon again.'No matter what, I will keep fighting for my chance and not let my 8th season at Arsenal end like this.

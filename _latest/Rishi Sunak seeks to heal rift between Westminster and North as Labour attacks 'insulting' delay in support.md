<p>The Government has sought to heal the rift between Westminster and the North today, with a financial package that can be backdated to cover those who have been under Tier 2 restrictions for the last three months.&#160;</p>
<p>Rishi Sunak unveiled&#160;this morning&#160;pledged cash grants of up to &#163;2,100 per month&#160;for businesses in the hospitality, accommodation and leisure sector, which can be backdated to August.&#160;For the Jobs Support Scheme, which replaces furlough, employer contributions have been cut&#160;five per cent and the minimum hours requirements dropped from a third to 20 per cent.&#160;</p>
<p>But his delay in acting&#160;was attacked as&#160;"nothing short of insulting" by the shadow chancellor.&#160;</p>
<p>"Many parts of our country have spent months under Tier 2 restrictions, without adequate support," Anneliese Dodds said.&#160;"What has changed which means it is the right thing to do now? The Chancellor has only caught up to the concerns of businesses when it looks like these restrictions will be affecting London and the West Midlands."</p>
<p>Andy Burnham said he could "barely believe" that support was being backdated, claiming this was something he had called for during talks that collapsed earlier this week.&#160;</p>
<p>Alex Norris, MP for Nottingham North, complained that he was being cut out of talks to place his region into Tier 3, which are set for this afternoon.&#160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile SNP's Alison Thewliss attacked the Treasury's "disrespectful" decision to give journalists more information about the package than relevant spokespeople.&#160;</p>
<p>And Mr Sunak was forced to defend his breakfast meeting with London-based business groups, telling the national press conference that representatives from Merseyside and North Yorkshire joined remotely.&#160;</p>

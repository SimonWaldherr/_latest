Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have savored family time the most during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Sunday, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex participated in a video chat with Malala Yousafzai to commemorate the International Day of the Girl. In addition to discussing women’s education, Pakistani activist Yousafzai asked the parents to 1-year-old Archie Harrison about their quarantine activities.

“How are you spending your time in COVID?” Yousafzai said, to which Harry, 36, quipped, “On Zoom!”

Meghan, 39, then noted that “outside of” virtual calls, they’re spending time with “little one” Archie, even witnessing his first steps.

“We were both there for his first steps, his first run, his first fall, his first everything,” Harry said.

Meghan and Harry, who stepped down as “senior” royals earlier this year, recently settled into their $14 million home in Montecito, California. Meghan said Sunday she and Harry are “fortunate” to have had this quality time with their son.

“It’s just fantastic, because I think in so many ways, we are fortunate to be able to have this time to watch him grow and in the absence of COVID, we would be traveling and working more externally and we’d miss a lot of those moments,” the former “Suits” star explained. “It’s been a lot of really good family time.”

Meghan and Harry have been busy amid the global health crisis, even signing a multi-year deal with Netflix in September. Harry is also rumored to be returning to the UK, where he could potentially speak with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, in relation to past voting comments.

<div><p>We hear the former home of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Connelly and her <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/04/27/meet-the-4-hot-new-characters-in-avengers-age-of-ultron/">Marvel-man husband Paul Bettany</a> is (unofficially) back <a href="https://www.elliman.com/newyorkcity/buildings-communities/detail/527-c-725-95438/17-prospect-park-west-north-slope-brooklyn-ny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the market for $12.9 million</a>. The 25-foot-wide limestone mansion, built in 1899, faces Prospect Park. Its <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/07/16/jennifer-connellys-old-park-slope-pad-sells-for-record-12-4m/">previous sale in 2015</a> set real estate records at the time.</p>
<p>The home&#8217;s 6,500 square feet include seven bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms along with exquisite details: original stained glass, mahogany columns, herringbone floors, carved mantels and five working gas fireplaces. There&#8217;s even a 600-bottle wine cellar hidden under the home&#8217;s front stoop, along with a chef&#8217;s kitchen, an entire children&#8217;s floor and an outdoor kitchen. A dumbwaiter offers old-school charm, while integrated sound and security systems keep things modern.</p>
<p>When Connelly and Bettany bought the mansion for $3.7 million back in 2003, they were considered Brooklyn pioneers. They sold it in 2008 for $8.45 million to a Google exec, who in turn sold it for $12.4 million to a family trust linked to Apollo Global Management. It was listed again last February but yanked off the market due to COVID-19, sources say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone who has owned this home has improved it,&#8221; notes Douglas Elliman broker Lindsay Barton Barrett, who reps the home&#8217;s current finance family owners. &#8220;The level of detail and how the home has evolved over time is really special.&#8221;</p>

It was in an unremarkable house, on an unremarkable street, in an unremarkable English village that Helen Hancock was killed. The 39 year-old former P.E teacher was stabbed to death by her ex-husband, Rhys Hancock, who was sentenced to 31 years in prison.

Helen’s death was so violent that prosecutor Michael Auty QC told Derby Crown Court there were “elements of sadism” to it. So much force was used against her body that one of the knives used to stab her was found totally buried inside her flesh. In total 66 injuries were inflicted on her and 37 on her new partner Martin Griffiths. When police arrived at the scene they found Rhys Hancock waiting for them. He immediately confessed. "I have clearly done it haven’t I? I have blood all over my clothes and it is clearly theirs. I have just lost it haven’t I?”, he said.

I was staying in the Derbyshire village of Duffield when Helen was killed last New Year’s Eve. When I heard what had happened I walked over to her house, through the pretty village’s quiet, leafy streets, past terraced cottages. Duffield is a friendly middle-class village full of families, a community so tight-knit that people can tell you the names of the children playing on the street.

Helen lived in a road of smart, matching houses: All with the same red-bricks, white windows and pitched roofs – as simple as if drawn by a child. Each has the same tidy front lawn, with the same neat bushes and rows of recycling bins outside. The blue and white police tape that had been hung to close off the street, the neon yellow police cars and blue pathologist’s tent pitched outside Helen’s house looked as alien in that suburban street as if a UFO had landed.

It seemed as impossible to imagine then, as it still does, that in such an ordinary family home something so brutal had taken place. Yet the disturbing reality is that for women it is with the people they have loved most that they are least safe.

An Office of National Statistics analysis of homicides, released in February this year, showed that female victims of homicide aged over 16 years were more likely to be killed by a partner or ex-partner than anyone else (by contrast men were more likely to be killed by a friend or acquaintance).

Over the last 10 years in the UK, a woman has been killed by a partner or ex-partner, every four days. Last year the number of women killed by a current or former partner escalated to their highest levels in 14 years.

Since the pandemic started things have got worse. Domestic abuse and violence increased by 20 percent during the lockdown with the UN describing the worldwide increase as a “shadow pandemic” alongside Covid-19. At least 16 suspected domestic abuse killings in the UK identified by campaigners since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed.

When I asked those who knew Helen what she was like they said “normal”. Typically I was told “when I heard who it was I was just so shocked”, “she is probably the last person I’d have imagined” and “she was just a normal mum”.

People described her as “vivacious”, “outgoing”, “always smiling” and “really down to earth”. Her father said she was a “beautiful, thoughtful and lovely daughter”. But the thought to which people returned was that “Helen was just so normal, that’s what’s so shocking about it”.

I wish I had been as shocked. But having covered murder cases before I had already learned that terrible truth – that heinous crimes don’t happen in the underground, to shady figures in foreboding settings on dark streets. They happen to ordinary people, in family homes, in the places where we all live.

It is that horror of everyday terror, which is key to the latest Netflix documentary everyone is gripped by American Murder: The Family Next Door. (If you have not seen it then stop reading now as I am about to reveal what takes place).

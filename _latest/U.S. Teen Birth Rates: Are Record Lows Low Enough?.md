Like most teachers, freelance educator Lindsay Fram had to make an abrupt pivot to distance learning when the coronavirus pandemic shut down public schools in March. She did research and connected with her colleagues, leaning into the challenge of teaching in a virtual classroom.

"I read education blogs and Twitter threads and articles about distance learning," she says. "I Zoomed with colleagues to brainstorm," and within days "I was up and running" with a full curriculum, including props and visual aids.

Although she's not attached to one school, Fram felt duty-bound to make the change because she strongly believes her subject – sex education – is too important to get left behind.

"The overarching goal of every class I teach, from kindergarten through college, is to strip the conversation of shame – to make sure that every young person I talk to knows that sexuality is natural, normal and healthy," says Fram, who is based in New York City but teaches about reproductive health in schools across the country. "There is no room for shame in sex education."

Experts say the type of frank, fact-based sex education classes Fram leads, along with free or low-cost access to contraception, are major factors in a drastic reduction of the U.S. birth rate among girls ages 15 to 19. Once identified as an urgent national issue, the rate has fallen by more than 70% over roughly three decades, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But organizations working to curb teenage pregnancy say this progress could be undermined by a combination of factors, ranging from changes in funding for reproductive health clinics to widely varying sex-ed curricula. Different schools can pivot in programs from real-world discussions like Fram's to faith-based programs emphasizing that sex before marriage is a harmful life choice and a moral failing.

And despite the decline in birth rate, the U.S. still has had one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy among Western industrialized nations in recent years. And there's speculation that the decadeslong campaign against underage pregnancy could be undone by its own progress.

"In a lot of ways this is a success story," says Andrea Kane, vice president for policy and strategic partnerships at Power to Decide, a nonprofit aimed at preventing teen and unplanned pregnancy. "We've seen such dramatic progress on an issue people once thought of as intractable."

Yet that success "has reduced the sense of urgency" and drawn attention away from a persistent public health issue, Kane says. "This could turn around at any time. We can't become complacent and stop paying attention. We can't declare victory and go home."

There's no doubt that teen pregnancies and births were once at the top of the national agenda.

According to CDC statistics, the teen birth rate peaked in 1957 at just under 100 births per 1,000 girls and women , in the midst of the baby boom after World War II. Yet around that time, statistics show, only about 15% of teen mothers were unmarried.

Although the rate slowly declined for the next few decades, it briefly spiked toward the end of the century, reaching nearly 62 births per 1,000 in 1991. The problem was highlighted on the national stage in 1995: During his State of the Union address that year, President Bill Clinton singled out "the epidemic" of unmarried teen pregnancies and births as "our most serious social problem."

"I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with anti-pregnancy programs that work. But the government can only do so much," Clinton said. "Tonight, I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference."

Meanwhile, plenty of experts have viewed teen pregnancy and births less as an isolated social or moral issue and more through the lens of the social determinants of health . Researchers have linked teen pregnancy or births to poverty, which in turn can translate to reduced access to health care, healthy food, quality education and scores of other social shortcomings.

To be sure, teen pregnancies are "a global problem" found "in high-, middle-, and low-income countries," according to a World Health Organization fact sheet. "Around the world, however, adolescent pregnancies are more likely to occur in marginalized communities, commonly driven by poverty and lack of education and employment opportunities."

Early pregnancies among young girls "have major health consequences for adolescent mothers and their babies," according to the WHO. Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the top cause of death among girls aged 15 to 19 years worldwide, the WHO notes, though low- and middle-income countries account for nearly all global maternal deaths of women aged 15–49 years. Some 3.9 million unsafe abortions happen each year among 15- to 19-year-olds, the WHO says.

It's not just the mothers at risk: Babies born to mothers under age 20 "face higher risks of low birth weight, preterm delivery and severe neonatal conditions," according to the WHO.

Clinton's focus on teen pregnancy spawned Kane's organization, Power to Decide, which was renamed in 2017 from The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. And amid an ongoing debate over teaching abstinence only vs. comprehensive sex education as the correct approach, young people nationwide seem to have gotten the message about premature parenthood: The birth rate for teens 15 to 19 years old in the U.S. has fallen by 60% since 2007 and hit a record low of 16.6 births per 1,000 in 2019, according to provisional data from the CDC .

Experts say education, coupled with access to birth control, has helped bring the rate down dramatically, although rates among Black and Latino teenagers have been persistently high compared with the rate for whites. Notably, the share of high school students who reported having sexual intercourse also has decreased over time, from 54.1% in 1991 to 38.4% in 2019, according to CDC survey data .

"It's a complicated issue and it has complicated solutions, policy and otherwise," Kane says. "There is no one explanation or magic bullet to solve the problem."

"The state of sex ed is very uneven, depending on where people live," Kane says. "A lot of this is driven at the local level," where communities and school boards make decisions about the sex-ed curriculum. Young people, she says, simply "may not get enough relevant information for them."

Children in foster care, for example, tend to have a higher rate of teen pregnancy because they miss school at a higher rate than most children, Kane says: "They may miss the course on sex ed."

While Kane and her colleagues believe fact-based, sometimes explicit sex education is the key to the decline, others believe that a traditional family structure, coupled with an emphasis on abstinence, is the most important factor in reducing underage pregnancies.

"Research does show that girls have lower rates of unwed pregnancies when they grow up in an intact family, with a married mom and dad, where the family regularly practices its faith," says Jeff Johnston, an analyst with Focus on the Family, a nonprofit that promotes Christian conservative social views.

"We should all want teens to delay sexual activity until marriage," says Johnston, pointing out that underage parents have higher rates of poverty, pregnancy complications and other problems, and that their children are more likely to suffer from low birth weight and additional issues . "Young people will be more successful if they finish high school, work or go to school full time, and marry before having children."

Johnston agrees that education is key to reducing teen pregnancies, though he thinks those lessons should come from the home.

"Parents should be the first and main source of information for their children about relationships, sexuality and marriage," Johnston says. "We encourage parents to maintain an ongoing dialogue about these topics, starting when their children are young and passing on their beliefs," including waiting to have sex until marriage, among other traditional values.

But Sara Flowers, vice president of education for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, says an abstinence-only approach is unrealistic.

"No matter what community they belong to, young people becoming sexually active is a normal part of their human development," Flowers says. "It's important to remember that teen pregnancy and birth rates are just two measures of whether a community's infrastructure supports young people's access to sex education from a young age, as well as their access to the full spectrum of sexual and reproductive health care needed to make informed decisions related to their health."

Encompassing the issue of abortion as well, the debate over reproductive rights and health has factored into government policies aimed at helping teenage girls avoid pregnancy – including through a recent overhaul of a Nixon-era program, known as Title X, that subsidizes family planning and reproductive health services.

Regulatory changes made in 2019 ban health care providers who receive Title X funds from issuing abortion referrals to pregnant girls and women. At the same time, clinics that emphasize contraceptive methods such as natural family planning or abstinence could gain standing in seeking government grants .

Critics worry the changes will effectively eliminate reproductive health care for many low-income patients. Health centers affiliated with Planned Parenthood, for example, no longer receive the funding .

The original Title X program "really allowed for contraception and availability to contraception and long-acting contraception to young women who needed it," says Colleen Murray, senior science officer for Power to Decide. "It provides greater access to young women from lower-income communities that need to have free and reduced-price contraception."

Then there are the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic. With many children attending school remotely, with less direct supervision, "there are reasonable theories about whether the pandemic might cause teen pregnancy rates to go up or down," says Kane of Power to Decide.

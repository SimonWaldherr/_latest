Marcus Rashford today leads a roll call of heroes honoured for their part in the UK's response to coronavirus.

The footballer stands with 414 "unsung heroes" who helped the Covid-19 fight in a specially-expanded Queen's Birthday Honours.

Others made 'Covid' MBEs include “The Body Coach” Joe Wicks, 34, whose daily PE classes streamed on YouTube kept children fit during lockdown, and “Mr Motivator” Derrick Evans, 67, who encouraged stay-at-home Britons to exercise.

Rashford - who shamed Boris Johnson into providing free school meals over the summer - said: "As a young black man from Wythenshawe, never did I think I would be accepting an MBE, never mind an MBE at the age of 22.

"The fight to protect our most vulnerable children is far from over."

In the regular Honours list, TV cake queen Mary Berry and BT advert star Maureen Lipman become Dames while Poirot actor David Suchet is knighted in the honours.

There are CBEs for Professor Brian Cox, veteran morning television presenter Lorraine Kelly, Life actor Adrian Lester and singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading. And Dizzee Rascal is made an MBE after bringing grime into the mainstream.

In a string of corporate honours, billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa have been made CBEs a week after snapping up supermarket giant Asda in a £6.8 billion deal.

In sport, rugby star Gareth Thomas has a CBE. Former England fast bowler Darren Gough, who won Strictly Come Dancing in 2005, becomes an MBE, and Happy Valley scriptwriter Sally Wainwright receives an OBE.

Interior designer Kelly Hoppen, who starred in Dragons' Den becomes an MBE. Fashion designer Sir Paul Smith becomes a Companion of Honour. Great North Run pioneer Brendan Foster becomes a Sir as does soap opera writer Phil Redmond, who created Brookside.

But the ordinary men and women across the land who kept the country running in this generation's darkest hour are also honoured by the monarch.

The Queen authorised the delay of her traditional Birthday Honours from June so people who mobilised could be recognised.

PM Boris Johnson said: “This year's honours recipients are a testament to the sort of country we are – caring, compassionate and resolute in the face of a global pandemic.

"The hard work and dedication of these local, often unsung heroes has helped carry us through. I congratulate them all.”

Below are some of the most famous names and a selection of unsung Covid heroes recognised this year - as well as a few of the usual political loyalists, including a super-rich Tory donor property developer.

Then keep scrolling down to see a full list of all 1,495 names.

Famous names

Mary Berry

Mary Berry said she is "overwhelmed to receive the very great honour" of being made a Dame.

The former Great British Bake Off judge has earned the status of national treasure over a six-decade career.

She said: "I am absolutely overwhelmed to receive this very great honour. For most of my life I have been lucky enough to follow my passion to teach cookery through books and the media.

"I just wish my parents and brothers were here to share my joy, as my only achievement at school was just one O-level in cookery."

The Manchester United and England star, 22, is awarded the MBE for services to vulnerable children during the crisis.

He shamed Boris Johnson into giving 1.3 million poor kids free school meals during the summer holidays.

He said the Prime Minister recommended him for the honour, adding: "This is a very special moment for myself and my family, but particularly my mum who is the real deserving recipient of the honour."

David Suchet

Best known for playing Hercule Poirot in the long-running Agatha Christie detective series, David Suchet's acting career has spanned 50 years.

He has received a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to drama and charity after a distinguished history on stage and in television.

Maureen Lipman

Maureen Lipman has enjoyed a varied career on stage and screen spanning more than 50 years.

The 74-year-old actress, who has been made a dame for services to charity, entertainment and the arts, has been a regular presence on TV since the 1960s.

Her lengthy CV includes everything from a comedy turn in a BT advert to a supporting role in an Oscar-winning drama.

Lorraine Kelly

The beloved 60-year-old TV presenter is among those being made a CBE after a career spanning three decades.

She worked as a researcher and news reporter in the 1980s before helping launch GMTV in 1993.

Joe Wicks

Joe Wicks said being made an MBE is like nothing he could have imagined growing up and a "dream come true".

The Body Coach started out as a fitness trainer when, sometimes, nobody would attend his bootcamps.

This year the 35-year-old claimed a Guinness World Record after one of his online fitness classes was watched by nearly a million people. His workouts raised £580,000 for the NHS.

Dizzee Rascal

One of grime's pioneers, Dizzee Rascal helped bring a little known genre of high-tempo rap music to the mainstream.

The rapper and producer, real name Dylan Mills, has been made an MBE for services to music.

He attended a number of different schools owing to his bad behaviour and got his nickname from a teacher.

But with the success of his debut solo album, 2003's Boy In Da Corner, he struck out on his own.

Joan Armatrading

Singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading has received a CBE for services to music, charity and equal rights.

Armatrading, 69, was born on the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts but moved to Brookfields, then a district of Birmingham, aged seven.

A prolific recording artist, she has continued to release albums since her 1972 debut, Whatever's For Us.

She is celebrated for her contralto voice and varied musical style, taking in folk, jazz, blues, soul and rock.

Gareth Thomas

Former Welsh rugby star Gareth Thomas is made a CBE while cricketer Darren Gough is made an MBE.

The Wales and British Lions legend, nicknamed “Alfie”, has trailblazed for gay sports stars and spoken movingly of living with HIV.

Unsung coronavirus heroes

The NHS chief who lost her uncle

(Image: PA)

Associate Director of Nursing at King’s College NHS Foundation Trust Felicia Kwaku, 52, fought back tears as she described her pride in receiving an OBE.

Londoner Felicia told how a relative and a close colleague died as the virus ripped through the nation, while she and brave comrades served on the frontline.

“I actually lost my uncle in the first week of April,” she said. “He was taken into ICU on a Friday and then he died on the Saturday, so that changes your perspective of working in the field."

The ASDA driver who delivered on days off

ASDA delivery driver Geoff Norris used his own car on days off to make sure elderly and vulnerable customers got their shopping during lockdown.

But he denied being a “superhero” as he scooped a British Empire Medal, insisting: “It was a team effort.”

He said: "As Covid hit and just before it started to lock down, you noticed all the delivery slots were being booked, everything was taken, so we were delivering to regular customers and on the last week or so before they were saying, 'We can't get any slots'.

"I turned round and said, 'Look, I'll see what I can do, just keep your eye open'."

The online pub quizmaster

(Image: Jon Super for The FA)

Online pub quizmaster and former landlord Jay Flynn, who's been made an MBE, posed trivia questions through Facebook and YouTube to “lift a few local people’s spirits”.

Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have taken part and he has raised £750,000 for good causes, including NHS, homelessness and Alzheimer's charities.

The car salesman, 38, from Darwen, Lancs, said: “It started as something for friends and family to do.

"By the time the first quiz came round on March 26 there were half a million people either interested or coming to the quiz. I was like a rabbit in the headlights.”

The council worker who saved the homeless

A council worker who helped bring more than 200 homeless people into safe accommodation at the start of the lockdown receives a British Empire Medal.

Ajitha Sajeev, who has worked at Newham Council in East London for 30 years, helped 191 people off the streets and 40 people out of shared accommodation including night shelters to keep them safe from coronavirus.

"I was pushed to my full capacity both mentally and physically during the Covid-19 pandemic, but believed that I could make a difference,” said the 52-year-old.

"All staff who came out to help at that uncertain time are heroes in my eyes."

The man who turned a pub into a hospital canteen

Restaurateur David Maguire becomes an MBE after switching his gastropub into a makeshift NHS canteen, providing free food to thousands of hospital staff.

His team served “significantly over 100,000” meals, including “a gigantic amount of pizzas, fish and chips and various pastas and curries”, during the pandemic.

“When the NHS and other frontline workers came to us it would still be in prime condition, and they could take it away and package it up,” said David, 62.

The train driver who volunteered in the NHS

(Image: PA)

Train driver Jolene Miller volunteered to return to the NHS to help former colleagues when the pandemic struck.

Jolene, 42, worked as a paramedic for 13 years before switching careers, but kept her healthcare registration by working at events.

Jolene, of Ingleby Barwick, Teesside, worked in triage at Darlington Memorial Hospital, assessing patients arriving for treatment.

“I was of the opinion that I can't sit back and do nothing,” said Jolene, who scoops a British Empire Medal.

Political cronies and former MPs

Conservatove Party loyalists and super-rich figures from the business world are once again rewarded as honours are unveiled.

Long-standing Tory donor Tony Gallagher, a multi-millionaire property developer who hosted David Cameron's 50th birthday party and who has pumped hundreds of thousands of pounds into the party both personally and through his companies, becomes a Sir.

He entertained the former Prime Minister at Sarsden House, a listed 17th-Century Oxfordshire mansion set in 459 acres which Sir Tony bought for £26million in 2006.

The entrepreneur is said to be part of the so-called "Chipping Norton set" centred around the pretty Cotswolds town in the former Tory leader's old Oxfordshire constituency.

The two men reportedly came to know one another when Mr Cameron became the local MP and since 2007 Mr Gallagher has donated more than £300,000 to the Conservatives.

Earlier this year, Boris Johnson registered a gift from Mr Gallagher of a "sterling silver envelope" worth £780 following the birth of his son Wilfred. Downing Street said later that the present had been entered on the parliamentary register in error and was being removed as the PM had opted to return it.

The Tory former leader of Kent County Council, Paul Carter, is also knighted.

Ex-Conservative MP Anne Main, who lost her St Albans seat to the Liberal Democrats last year, is made a CBE.

There are knighthoods for two former Labour MPs, David Hanson and Nic Dakin, who were ousted at December's elections.

How this year's Honours were different

The Queen's Birthday Honours are usually published in June to mark the monarch's official birthday.

But, with Buckingham Palace's approval, this summer's announcement was delayed so Whitehall officials could recognise the extraordinary contributions from those who served on the coronavirus frontline in this most extraordinary of years – especially NHS and care workers.

A total of 1,495 people across the UK are honoured.

Healthcare and social care workers account for 14% of the accolades, with 41 nurses and midwives receiving gongs compared with 17 in the 20202 New Year Honours.

Some 414 unsung heroes who helped the country fight Covid-19 are rewarded.

Some 13% of recipients from an ethnic minority. A total of 740 women are recognised, representing 49%.

Thomas Mitchell, who has died aged 88, was an IRA man from Dublin who was twice elected to the Commons while serving 10 years for his part in a raid on Lisanelly Barracks at Omagh, and twice disqualified.

Thomas James Mitchell was born in Dublin on July 29 1931, and after leaving school worked as a bricklayer. He also joined the IRA, which throughout the 1950s conducted a sporadic campaign against Partition.

In June 1954, the IRA stole a lorry-load of weaponry from Gough Barracks in Armagh. A repeat operation was planned, to secure more weapons and raise Republican morale and support. This time the target was the Royal Iniskilling Fusiliers’ barracks at Omagh.

On October 17 1954, Mitchell and 14 other volunteers, led by Eamonn Boyce who had taken part in the first raid, got into the barracks, overpowering one of three soldiers on guard.

The soldier managed to raise the alarm and eight of the raiders were detained as they tried to shoot their way out. Boyce escaped but was captured later. Four soldiers were wounded, two seriously.

The raiders were charged with “treason-felony” – waging war against the Queen and the British people – and that December were found guilty and sentenced: Boyce to 12 years’ penal servitude, the others to 10 years.

The Omagh raid was not only an embarrassment to the authorities; it had the hoped-for effect of attracting recruits and money to violent Republicanism.

Sinn Fein, the movement’s political arm, had a policy of “abstentionism”, with members elected to any authority not taking their seats. But, sensing an increase in its support, it contested all 12 Northern Ireland seats at the 1955 election, not just those in its Catholic heartland.

In Belfast’s Crumlin Road prison, Mitchell commanded the IRA prisoners’ unit – refusing membership to several inmates who were felt to have recognised the court that sentenced them. He had been inside for almost two and a half years when he was nominated for Mid-Ulster. Convicted felons serving 12 months or more were ineligible for election, but there was nothing to stop them standing.

On May 26 1955, Mitchell polled 29,737 votes to defeat the Unionist Charles Beattie by 260 votes after a recount. A comrade from the Omagh raid, Phil Clarke, was also elected, for Fermanagh & South Tyrone. They were Sinn Fein’s first victories in Westminster elections since 1918.

Unionists in Fermanagh & South Tyrone petitioned to have Clarke unseated, and the High Court awarded the seat to the defeated Unionist, Lt-Col Robert Grosvenor, the future Duke of Westminster.

Mid-Ulster’s Unionists took no such step, however, so once the deadline for petitioning expired that July, the Leader of the Commons, Harry Crookshank, proposed a fresh election. By 197 votes to 63, MPs declared Mitchell “incapable of being elected or returned as a member of this House” and ordered a by-election.

Mitchell was renominated, and so was his opponent. And on August 11 he was re-elected with an increased vote (30,392) and a majority of 806. This time Beattie did lodge a protest.

When the Election Court convened at Omagh that October, Mitchell insisted on conducting his own case. On the second day he made a lengthy address to the court, saying the people of Mid-Ulster were on trial and were about to be disfranchised. “Sinn Fein does not recognise this, or any other puppet court set up by England or by the pseudo-patriots of Stormont,” he declared. “Nothing this court can do will alter the decision of 30,000 Mid-Ulster people.”

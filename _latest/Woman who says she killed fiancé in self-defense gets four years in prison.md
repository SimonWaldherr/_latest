<div><p>A New Jersey woman who insists she was defending herself when she fatally stabbed her fianc&#233; has been sentenced to four years in prison, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Ciara Williams, 28, was initially <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/01/woman-stabbed-fiance-left-him-in-car-outside-hospital-to-die-authorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charged with murder and weapons offenses</a> in the September 2019 stabbing death of 35-year-old Dennis Power, but prosecutors later downgraded the charge to reckless manslaughter when &#8220;legitimate self-defense claims&#8221; arose during the investigation, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The claims of self-defense, coupled with considerable proof problems, led to a resolution which we believe to be fair and just after careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances,&#8221; Billhimer said.</p>
<p>An attorney for Williams &#8212; who pleaded guilty to reckless manslaughter in July &#8212; said she drove Power to a hospital after stabbing him in the heart with a kitchen knife during a fight at their Brick Township apartment, <a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/2020/10/21/im-not-monster-brick-woman-gets-4-years-fiances-slaying/6003656002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Asbury Park Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the action of someone who set out that day to kill someone,&#8221; attorney Francis Hodgson said.</p>
<p>Video of the fight that ended in Power&#8217;s death shows him hitting Williams with a broomstick, prompting her to pick up the phone to call the cops, Hodgson said. But Power grabbed the phone, leading Williams to grab a knife to protect herself, according to her attorney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her response was disproportionate; it was still a response to the actions of Mr. Power,&#8221; Hodgson said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Williams, meanwhile, told a judge she stabbed Power to &#8220;stop him from putting his hands on me,&#8221; the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to defend myself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a monster.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Power&#8217;s relatives said Williams was actually the abuser in the pair&#8217;s relationship, with his sister citing an Instagram message he sent her eight months before he was killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in an abusive relationship,&#8221; the message read. &#8220;It&#8217;s embarrassing. Who would believe me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Power&#8217;s sister, Chelsea Miller, said he also sent her photos and videos of Williams throwing hot coffee on him and of her holding a knife. Power was also planning on leaving Williams, Miller said.</p>
<p>&#8220;His stuff was packed,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He was ready to go, and she knew it &#8230; There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind this was a calculated plan to end his life because he no longer wanted to be with Ciara.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams must serve 85 percent of her sentence &#8211; or nearly three years and five months &#8211; before she&#8217;s eligible for parole, the Asbury Park Press reported.</p>

Hundreds of lawyers in New York and beyond who made a specialty out of showing up for court appearances on behalf of other lawyers have found themselves out of work as courts have moved online.

"We were all definitely making six-figure incomes:" so-called per-diem lawyers could make about $125 per appearance, and for some of them, the numbers really added up.

New York courts have gradually been reopening for in-person trials and arguments, but the events that filled a per-diem's day are mostly virtual, so the lawyers who used to send them work can call in themselves.

Danielle Caminiti's legal career had been going well. She'd built a business, Have U Covered, making court appearances on behalf of attorneys who were too busy to do so in Queens, and she farmed out work to other lawyers in other parts of the state. Then the pandemic struck.

New York courthouses began to close on March 17. The courtrooms that typically buzzed with activity, where social distancing was impossible — "defendant here on Adams?" a clerk might shout into a room full of chattering attorneys to kick off a judge's weekly calendar call — emptied out. For weeks, no new cases were allowed to be filed at all.

Caminiti's business fell sharply. She began selling "Have U Covered" face-coverings, noting that she was available for conference calls and video appearances and updating clients on the flurry of emergency orders emanating from various parts of the state court system. But as the weeks turned into months, she began to wonder when, if ever, she'd return to a courthouse.

Over the summer, she began posting cooking pictures to Instagram under a twist on her old brand — "Have U Covered In The Kitchen"— using the hashtag #FromLitigationToSalivation.

"It was started just to keep sane and to keep busy and to feed my family in the process," she said, adding that she hasn't been able to earn any money from the videos yet. "I have an office I can't use. I can't get into court, besides maybe a sporadic virtual conference here and there."

Outside of the corporatized structure of Big Law, it's not uncommon for lawyers to make a living as contractors, going from project to project. In some cities, most prominently New York, so-called per-diem attorneys would be paid to show up to conferences and other, typically low-stakes appearances by solo practitioners and small law firms that didn't have the bandwidth to send their own lawyers.

Caminiti said other per-diems she knows are unemployed, or have turned side-hustles like reiki coaching and motivational speaking into full-time jobs.

Other referral services are also hurting: Samson Freundlich said his firm Per Diem Services Inc. had revenue in the seven figures last year and has seen work drop to almost nothing.

By the estimates of Freundlich and others interviewed, scores or perhaps hundreds of lawyers in New York City who made a living from showing up have had their work upended. While some Big Law firms, where partners commonly make upwards of $1 million a year, have been buoyed by corporate dealmaking, big-ticket bankruptcies, lease renegotiations, and helping cash-poor companies tap the capital markets, other lawyers have been hurting.

Lawyers have had to move or switch gears as per diem work has dried up

Some per-diems have mostly stopped doing legal work. Diana Gianturco has turned to doing video seminars Diana Gianturco

Diana Gianturco, a longtime presence in Queens Supreme Court, said she'd made upwards of $200,000 in a good year before the pandemic hit, and said other serious, full-time per diems also made six figures. But the work dried up starting in March, she said. She relocated to Florida and began shooting a video seminar for lawyers about neuroplasticity and the power of positivity.

"I was 'Diana in Queens,'" she said. "Like Cher or Madonna, I had one name. And then all of a sudden, it just disappeared. Like, overnight."

Others have taken up other kinds of legal practice. Barry Seidel, who was once the subject of a cover story in the New York Law Journal in 1999 for building a huge practice around per diem work, said he knew it wouldn't last forever. While his income has dropped by about half since the pandemic started, he has a probate and estates practice that has helped him stay afloat, he said.

Devoted per diems like Gianturco and Caminiti are probably in the minority. Many people who do per-diem work are semi-retired or have parenting responsibilities. Jonathan Broder, a Florida lawyer whose firm Vortex Legal helps clients arrange coverage for court hearings in dozens of states, said his platform has about 11,000 contract attorneys on it, but only 3,500 have been active in the last year. Some have done just one hearing, while others have done hundreds.

"Outside of New York, it's really a gig economy," he said.

And not all of them made a Big Law-level incomes from it. Monica Trombley, an entertainment lawyer, said she made about $3,000 a month from putting in appearances in New York family court for special immigrant juvenile petitions and working on foreclosure cases, among other per-diem work. These days, she is getting unemployment benefits and doing occasional legal jobs. She said she may move if circumstances don't improve.

NYC courts might take a while to open, leaving per-diems frustrated

Courthouses are still operating at a reduced capacity in New York, so most conferences that per-diems used to cover are occurring virtually. The small firms and solo practitioners that made use of per-diems can have their own lawyers attend court telephonically or via videoconference, without having to travel or wait for their case to be called.

Jeena Belil, an attorney on Long Island who works on personal-injury cases and represents doctors' offices in disputes over no-fault insurance policies, said she used to be able to farm out work to three or four different per-diem lawyers. Now, that's dropped to one. While she's saving the two to three percent of her business's income that used to pay per diems, she said revenue will definitely be lower this year.

"I decided I was going to keep people employed, at least in the no-fault area, and make sure I could give them work," she said. "I'm not someone who requires volume to keep a practice going. [But did the pandemic] hit my practice? Absolutely."

Another issue is that many firms only delegated minor appearances to per diems -- asking a clerk for extra time, say, rather than taking depositions or arguing important motions.

New York courts may never return to business-as-usual. Jury trials have been halted in New York City since March and are set to resume later this month, Chief Judge Janet DiFiore said on Oct. 5. She added that the number of people entering state courthouses was one-tenth of what it used to be.

"We have been, and we will continue to be, extremely measured, cautious, and responsible in every decision we make about our limited, incremental resumption of in-court proceedings," she said.

Some per-diems are dissatisfied with the pace of reopening. Freundlich said he's considering suing New York state over its restrictions on courthouse activities.

"What we're doing in the name of safety and efficiency is actually destroying our industry," he said.

ARLINGTON, Texas — Power and precision collided, often, in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series. Perhaps no teams play the modern game better than the Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers, and in the opening round of what could be a seven-game engagement, the difference between the two clubs was one faltering reliever.

Handed a tie game in the top of the ninth inning Monday night, Dodgers right-hander Blake Treinen was strafed by the Braves, yielding a tiebreaking home run from Austin Riley as the Braves broke it open for a 5-1 victory and a 1-0 lead in what's already a compelling NLCS at Globe Life Field.

Suddenly, the Dodgers, the World Series favorites, are in deep. They will send future Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw to the mound in Tuesday's Game 2, badly needing the better version of his playoff self. He'll be opposed by Braves rookie Ian Anderson, who has not given up a run in two playoff starts.

For now, there's one well-defined playoff goat for LA.

Treinen, handed a 1-1 tie, quickly put Riley in a two-strike hole before the 6-3, 240-pounder stepped out of the box to right himself. He fouled off a pair of two-strike pitches, laid off a slider and then rifled a 98-mph sinker into the Braves bullpen in left center field.

"Probably the biggest hit of his life," mused Braves All-Star Freddie Freeman, who took the pressure off his mates with a first-inning homer of his own. "That’s a pretty good No. 9 hole hitter we’ve got, eh?"

The barn door was open for a four-run ninth inning that culminated in Ozzie Albies matching Riley’s feat, whizzing a two-run shot into the gaggle of happy Braves relievers beyond the fence as a mixed of 10,600 fans sat stunned.

It was the first game played before fans in this pandemic-stricken Major League Baseball season, and those on hand might have realized little has changed in the game since they last bounded through a turnstile.

Radar-busting velocity and home runs always prevail, and in a taut Game 1, the Braves had just enough of both.

They received a fantastic starting pitching performance from Max Fried, who at 26 is the elder statesman of a Braves pitching staff that began the postseason with four shutouts in five games.

After Fried’s six innings of four-hit work, and three shutout innings from the bullpen, the Braves are now unscored upon in 54 of 58 postseason innings.

Fried added and subtracted velocity like a mathematician, beguiling the Dodgers with a 75-mph curveball and then humping his fastball up as firmly as 98-mph. He struck out nine Dodgers, and five of them featured swinging strikes on pitching velocities with at least 18 mph difference.

"I’m just glad to see how Max responded," Braves manager Brian Snitker said of Fried, who needed 28 pitches to complete the first inning. "I was really proud of him, how he came out there. He got really efficient and his stuff got crisp.

"That stage that he’s on, and how he responded, was really impressive."

Fried's opposing number, Walker Buehler, struck out seven in five innings but was beguiled by five walks that upped his pitch count to 93 after five.

The only blemishes for either man? Home runs, of course, with Enrique Hernandez, part of the Dodgers’ righty-heavy lineup against Fried, crushing the lefty’s hanging breaking ball for a game-tying solo home run in the fifth to match Freeman's.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts tried to steal one more inning from Buehler in the sixth, but he gave up consecutive singles to Travis d’Arnaud and Albies. It was a tactical error that would hurt much more, later.

With two on and nobody out, Roberts employed his de facto closer, Brusdar Graterol, to punch the Dodgers out of the jam. Dustin May, the long-limbed, red-haired fireballing rookie, took over for the seventh and got the first out of the eighth before lefty Victor Gonzalez cleaned up his mess.

But who to pitch for the ninth?

With usual closer Kenley Jansen in limbo after an NL Division Series Game 2 disaster, Roberts opted for Treinen.

It was the Dodgers’ lone misstep of the night. And in a series this tight, one they could not afford.

"We’re like an NBA game — you don’t want to leave because a lot happens in the last third," says Snitker. "There’s been games we’re down to a strike and they keep coming back."

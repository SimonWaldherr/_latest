Early last year a strange thing happened to Keira Bell: she started to cry. It had been years since the 21-year-old from Hertfordshire was last able to properly shed tears, ever since she started receiving testosterone injections at the age of 17.

The male hormones and puberty blockers she was prescribed forced many changes in her teenage body: her voice dropped, hair sprouted on her face and body, and her sex drive increased.

There were other more concerning physical changes which she felt she had not been properly warned about by her clinicians, her bones started losing density and she suffered vaginal atrophy (a condition more commonly seen in post-menopausal women).

And, the tears dried up. At moments of extreme emotion Keira would instead feel a lump forming in her thickening throat. But even those moments became rarer, nullified by what she describes as a strange inner numbness.

“The first time I cried was very weird,” the now 22-year-old recalls. “It felt like I was becoming myself again.”

At the time she had decided to turn her back upon the pathway she had been directed down as a teenager and revert to her biological gender. “Detransition” is the proper term for it and while a very personal choice, it was one which has propelled Keira to the forefront of a growing movement of young people who feel they have been pressured or encouraged into gender reassignment treatments or surgeries, which they later regret.

Last week, she appeared at the Royal Courts of Justice for a landmark legal challenge against the Tavistock Clinic in London. Keira, who lives in Cambridge, was referred for assessment for puberty blockers by the clinic in 2013 and later had her breasts removed. She is bringing the action with an anonymous claimant called “Mrs A”, the mother of an autistic girl of 16 who is on an NHS gender development service waiting list.

Their aim is to ban puberty suppressants (which block hormones linked to a person’s biological sex) for under-18s, unless their parents obtain a court order, arguing children cannot fully understand the risks involved. As heard in court, a quarter of the children referred for puberty blocking medication last year by the Tavistock clinic (which runs the UK’s only gender-identity development service) were under 14, and half were under 16. The youngest was 10 years old.

The Tavistock & Portman NHS Trust rejects the claims, saying puberty suppressants are lawful, reversible, that they relieve distress by delaying the onset of puberty and allow children time to consider their gender. When contacted by The Telegraph, a spokesman for the trust said it was awaiting the outcome of the hearing but added the clinic “is a safe and thoughtful service which puts the best interest of its patients and their families first”.

A judgment is not expected for at least a few weeks but the case has ignited attention around the world. The hashtag “I stand with Keira Bell” has been widely shared on social media, prompting various young people who have undergone a similar experience to speak out. A crowdfunder to pay for her legal fees has raised around £130,000.

Keira, a quiet and thoughtful speaker, admits the attention of recent days has shocked her but also strengthened her resolve. “I do hope this case drops a reality bomb on the situation for some people,” she says.

Growing up in the Hertfordshire town of Letchworth, Keira had a “very rocky” childhood. Her parents separated when she was around five and she and her sister were shuttled between them, meaning she failed to settle long in any school.

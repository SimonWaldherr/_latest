 <p>"He was put forward for a peerage but the approval process is still ongoing," the source said.</p> <p>As an archbishop, he was among the 26 lords spiritual who have their places reserved in the upper chamber of Parliament for Church of England bishops.</p> <p>After he stepped down, Mr&#160;Sentamu&#160;was informed by No 10 that he was in line for a peerage, asking him to confirm his suitability and willingness to accept, the Sunday Times reported.</p> <p>However, a month later he was told that his name would not be included.</p> <p>His successor, Stephen Cottrell, who was enthroned as the 98th Archbishop of York on Sunday, tweeted: "Disturbed to find out today that whether it be through negligence or intent my predecessor +&#160;Sentamu&#160;has not been given the peerage that has been the custom for many years.</p> <p>"I trust this will soon be rectified. UKHouseofLords will benefit from his voice."</p> <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-lammy">David Lammy</a>, the shadow justice minister, said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "No 10 broke a precedent and snubbed Britain's first black archbishop for a peerage because it says the House of Lords is too large, but it made room for Ian Botham, Claire Fox and Theresa May's husband. Blatant institutional prejudice." </p> <p>David Davis, the former Conservative cabinet minister, said: "Number 10 has made a mistake in not ennobling John&#160;Sentamu.</p> <p>"He was a great archbishop. It cannot claim it needs to limit the size of the Lords whilst elevating Boris's brother. It should be put right immediately."</p></div>

Conor McGregor broke some major news Wednesday when he said on Twitter he’s accepted the UFC’s offer to fight Dustin Poirier on Jan. 23, and you know what that means: The major sports network talking heads have thoughts on the matter.

Thursday, McGregor’s comeback was given time for discussion by both ESPN and FOX Sports 1. Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman talked about it on “First Take,” as did Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe on “Undisputed.”

In short, when Kellerman points to Poirier being “a BJJ guy” (who calls Poirier that?) and Sharpe says he’d rather McGregor move up to fight UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya (a thought that came from out of nowhere), I’d say they probably haven’t been paying close attention.

But it’s McGregor, the biggest star in the UFC, and so this is what we get. You can check out both segments in the videos below:

“First Take”

“Undisputed”

A deal to re-write the global rules around the taxation of multinational tech giants will not be agreed this year as had previously been hoped for, the OECD has conceded.

Negotiations over how to tax companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google in future will continue between 137 countries until summer of next year.

The countries agreed to the extension after the pandemic culled any chance of meeting the original deadline. The OECD fears that a collapse in the talks could wipe 1pc off the global economy every year.

By comparison, a new agreement could increase global corporate tax worldwide by between 1.9pc and 3.2pc - the equivalent of around $50bn to $80bn (£38.4bn to £61.4bn) a year, the OECD claimed. If including an existing US minimum tax on overseas profits, that figure could reach $100bn.

The Paris-based organisation said on Monday that it had drafted a series of technical principles, which are ready to be implemented if agreements can be reached next year, on how companies should be taxed.

One element will require multinationals to pay part of their tax on profits to the countries in which their customers are located, even if they operate online and have no headquarters in that region.

Another part of the reform would see a minimum corporate tax rate - potentially 12.5pc - imposed on every multinational company, regardless of where it is based.

The technical principles will now be published to serve as a foundation for further talks, the OECD said, and will be presented to an online meeting of G20 finance ministers on Wednesday.

“It is clear that new rules are urgently needed to ensure fairness and equity in our tax systems, and to adapt the international tax architecture to new and changing business models,” said Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD.

“It is imperative that we take this work across the finish line. Failure would risk tax wars turning into trade wars at a time when the global economy is already suffering enormously.”

Public pressure is growing on big tech firms to pay their share under international tax rules, particularly given the effect the pandemic has had on national finances across the world.

A number of European countries, including the UK and France, have already introduced levies of their own in the absence of a global agreement.

Charlotte Richardson, UK tax partner at PwC, said the proposed new framework had the potential to be a “once in a lifetime change” to the corporate tax system.

“If agreed, it would potentially remove the highly distortive, gross base taxes such as the recently introduced UK Digital Services Tax and address the prospect of double taxation,” she said.

“In doing so, this could overcome a significant stumbling block in any UK-US trade negotiations. Nonetheless, there is still a long way to go and the complexity and implementation challenges shouldn’t be underestimated.”

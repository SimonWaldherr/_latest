While the college football world awaits the prime-time showdown between No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 Georgia, Gus Malzahn and Jeremy Pruitt have some 'splaining to do.

In an otherwise quiet Week 7, losses by Auburn and Tennessee are the biggest stories of Saturday's action. Top-ranked Clemson enjoyed a massive offensive performance, and every other Top 25 team added a notch in the win column.

Granted, part of the reason it was a slow weekend is because of six postponed games. That group included Top 10 teams Oklahoma State, Cincinnati and Florida.

But it also provided a little more attention for a trio of undefeated teams that earned a victory Wednesday or Friday.

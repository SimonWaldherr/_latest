<div><p>Waitrose and the Co-op have cut prices on hundreds of products this week in the latest sign that a Christmas price war is taking hold.&#160;</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s sixth and eighth-largest supermarkets have reduced the prices of more than 200 and 300 essential items respectively by an average of 15pc.&#160;</p>
<p>The moves come after other rivals also lowered prices as shoppers seeking more bargains.&#160;Items including honey, pork steaks and laundry liquid will cost less at Waitrose. Boss James Bailey said &#8220;times are tough for many&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Co-op invested &#163;50m to bring down the price for fresh fruit, vegetables, fresh meat, rice, pasta and coffee. It is also launching a new low-price range called Honest Value.</p>
<p>Jo Whitfield, the chief executive of the Co-op&#8217;s supermarkets, said &#8220;value is uppermost in the minds of shoppers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Her remarks echo those of David Potts at Morrisons, who said the price cuts on 400 items last month were in response to the &#8220;tough year&#8221; that consumers have endured.&#160;</p>
<p>Asda also invested &#163;100m on price cuts, while and Sainsbury's has reduced prices on more than 1000 own-brand products since February.</p>
<p>Tesco discounted hundreds of products exclusively for members of its Clubcard loyalty scheme last month, and expanded its Aldi price-matching campaign.</p>
<p>The traditional supermarkets are fighting hard to keep shoppers from defecting to German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which now hold a combined 14pc of the grocery market.&#160;</p>
<p>Restrictions on socialising and the end of the government&#8217;s furlough scheme could also mean households spend less in the run-up to Christmas than usual.&#160;</p>
<p>Prices <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/21/supermarket-price-war-wipes-higher-grocery-costs-lockdown/">have dropped through the summer </a>after a 2.5pc rise in inflation in the first month of the nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>By the first week of August, the bill for groceries was around 0.5pc higher than it was at the beginning of the year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week.&#160;</p>

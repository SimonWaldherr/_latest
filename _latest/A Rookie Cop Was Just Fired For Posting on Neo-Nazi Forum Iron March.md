  A Rookie Cop Was Just Fired For Posting on Neo-Nazi Forum Iron March 
description: > 
  An Indiana police department fired one of its newly-hired cops this weekend after antifascists tied the man to a post on Iron March, a defunct neo-Nazi forum that espoused racist, fascist, and anti-Semitic views.“Meet #JosephZacharek, newest member of Indy PD,” Twitter user @Ghosts_of_Past wrote, linking to the post.The user describes themselves as a “boring white Southern suburban housewife who likes to dox facists and racists.”“Member of #IronMarch, the forum for #Neonazis and #WhiteSupremacists,” @Ghosts_of_Past said in the tweet.“I'm nearly finished with an enlistment in the Army as a tank crewman,” Panzerleiter wrote at the time, adding later that they identified as “NatSoc,” referencing the largest neo-Nazi movement in the U.S.“I know the question everyone will have is, how does something like this get missed in a background investigation,” Flannelly told the Journal & Courier.

</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;@LafayetteINPD&#8212; it looks like you just hired a Nazi,&#8221; Twitter user @AntiFashGordon said <a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFashGordon/status/1317262592038047745?s=20">in a tweet</a> to the Lafayette Police Department Friday after a separate Twitter account, @Ghosts_of_Past, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghosts_of_Past/status/1317242596318605313?s=20">revealed </a>what was described as a post from police recruit Joseph Zacharek.</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;Meet #JosephZacharek, newest member of Indy PD,&#8221; Twitter user @Ghosts_of_Past <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghosts_of_Past/status/1317242596318605313?s=20">wrote,</a> <a href="https://cms.vice.com/vice/en_us/article/5f8daee9af4bae009c4c6cc6/edit">linking to the post.</a> The user describes themselves as a &#8220;boring white Southern suburban housewife who likes to dox facists and racists.&#8221;&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;Member of #IronMarch, the forum for #Neonazis and #WhiteSupremacists,&#8221; @Ghosts_of_Past said in the tweet. &#8220;He is "fully" a Nazi ("NatSoc"), and regrets &#8216;previously fool[ing] himself into believing all races are equal.&#8217; Huzzah on the new job!&#8221;</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>In the <a href="https://www.ironmarch.exposed/post/34570">Iron March post</a>, shared to Twitter via a website called &#8220;Iron March Exposed,&#8221; a person with the username &#8220;Panzerleiter&#8221; introduced themselves as a &#8220;23 year old American with mostly Eastern European ancestry plus a bit of Anglo.&#8221; The post was made in September 2016 to a forum that&#8217;s been linked to some of the world&#8217;s most dangerous neo-Nazi movements, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/atomwaffen-division">including Atomwaffen,</a> an organization associated with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/us/what-is-atomwaffen.html">several killings</a>.&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;I'm nearly finished with an enlistment in the Army as a tank crewman,&#8221; Panzerleiter wrote at the time, adding later that they identified as &#8220;NatSoc,&#8221; referencing the largest <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/national-socialist-movementnationalist-front">neo-Nazi movement in the U.S.&#160;</a></p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>When the Lafayette Police Department hired Zacharek in June, it <a href="http://lafayettepolice.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1037">noted in an announcement </a>that he had &#8220;served in the US Army for 3 years as a Tank Crewman.&#8221; Additionally, the Panzerleiter account was registered to a Gmail address bearing Zacharek&#8217;s full name, according to Iron March Exposed. (A VICE News email to that account bounced back.) At one point, an Iron March user trying to add Panzerleiter to a group chat on a Polish messaging service asked the account, &#8220;Your name is Joseph Zacharek right?&#8221; to which Panzerleiter responded, &#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>In a news statement announcing Zacharek&#8217;s firing Saturday, Lafayette Police Chief Patrick Flannelly said the department&#8217;s internal affairs division determined Zacharek &#8220;did participate in this online forum and that the information that was provided to LPD was accurate and credible.&#8221; Flannelly further said that Zacharek admitted the comments were his, according to the <a href="https://www.jconline.com/story/news/2020/10/17/lafayette-police-investigating-claim-new-lpd-officer-part-neo-nazi-forum/3693646001/">Lafayette Journal &amp; Courier</a>, and that he never would&#8217;ve taken the recruit on if he&#8217;d known about the posts.&#160;</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;I know the question everyone will have is, how does something like this get missed in a background investigation,&#8221; Flannelly told the Journal &amp; Courier. &#8220;How is it possible and how do we prevent this from ever happening again? I&#8217;m not going to sugar-coat this. Ultimately, it&#8217;s my responsibility. We missed it.&#8221;  </p>
<p>In the 2016 post flagged by Twitter users Friday, &#160;Zacharek wrote he was a &#8220;garden variety conservative libertarian&#8221; before he worked as an emergency medical technician, at which point he &#8220;openly questioned the view that all races are equal.&#8221; Then he found 4chan&#8217;s &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; board, he said, and began reading &#8220;recommended books in the NatSoc General threads.&#8221;&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;I would now say that I am fully NatSoc, and I'm especially interested in NatSoc economics as a way of throwing off the chains of usury and Jewish owned banking,&#8221;&#160; Zacharek wrote. &#8220;Basically, I joined because I want to engage in higher level fascist discourse than goes on in /pol/, and I want to be part of a community of likeminded people with the same or similar worldview. I look forward to the discussions here.&#8221;  </p>
<p>After a tweet about the old post went viral, The Lafayette Police Department pledged on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/LafayetteINPD/status/1317291918703951874?s=20">that it&#8217;d</a> &#8220;get to the truth.&#8221; Less than 24 hours later, Zacharek was fired.&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Zacharek was still in training at the time of his firing and hadn&#8217;t had contact with the public as a uniformed officer, according to the <a href="https://www.jconline.com/story/news/2020/10/17/lafayette-police-investigating-claim-new-lpd-officer-part-neo-nazi-forum/3693646001/">Journal &amp; Courier</a>.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>It was not immediately clear whether Zacharek had retained an attorney; a phone number for him was not publicly listed.&#160;</p>

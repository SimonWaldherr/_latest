Matt Slocum/Associated Press

Though the NHL draft has come and gone, and the free-agency market has been open for a week (as of noon ET on Friday), the B/R ice hockey team hasn't gotten its player-movement fix.

So we took a look at teams still in need of specific talent—not to mention others that would like a quick salary dump—and played matchmaker on five trades we believe to be mutually beneficial.

The five suggestions are listed alphabetically by the A side's last name.

Read on to see what we came up with and if any of your team's players could be packing a bag. And, as always, feel free to head down to the comments section to let us know how you feel.

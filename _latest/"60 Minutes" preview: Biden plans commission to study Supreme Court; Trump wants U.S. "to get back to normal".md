<p>"If elected, what I will do is I'll put together a national commission of&#160; &#8211;&#160; bipartisan commission of scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, liberal, conservative. And I will ask them to over 180 days come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-extends-pensylvania-mail-in-ballot-deadline/" target="_blank">court system</a> because it's getting out of whack &#8211; the way in which it's being handled and it's not about court packing. There's a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I've looked to see what recommendations that commission might make."&#160;</p><p>Biden continued: "There's a number of alternatives that are &#8211; go well beyond packing...The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want.

<p>When challenged on that and pressed for forward looking goals, Mr. Trump said: "To get back to normal. Get back to where we were. To have the economy rage and be great with jobs and everybody be happy. And that's where we're going, and that's where we're heading." &#160;&#160;</p><p>When asked by Stahl who was America's biggest foreign adversary, Mr. Trump singled out China. &#160; &#160;</p><p>"I would say China.

I think what happened was disgraceful, should never have happened... they should never have allowed this plague to get out of China and go throughout the world. 188 countries. Should never have happened." &#160;</p></div>

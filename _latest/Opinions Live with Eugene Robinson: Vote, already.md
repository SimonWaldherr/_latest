<div><p></p><p>Hi, everybody, and welcome to our weekly chat. Two weeks to go. Joe Biden still has a (let's be honest) massive lead in the national polls. But are the battleground states tightening? Will the "Republican DNA" in states like Ohio and Florida somehow bleed through in these final days? Is it all somehow a mirage? I doubt it, to tell the truth, but nobody can be certain. I wish it were possible to go through the next fourteen days (or longer, depending on the speed of the count) being absolutely sure of the outcome, but it's not. All any of us can do is play our individual role -- and help and encourage others to do the same. So vote, already. Do what you can to ensure that like-minded neighbors, friends and family vote as well. And know that while we will have to cross a Grand Canyon of crazy these next few weeks, we will make it to the other side.&#160;</p>
<p>One heads-up: Our chat next Tuesday will look a little different -- we're switching to a new software platform -- but the time, place and content will be the same. With that, let's get started!</p>

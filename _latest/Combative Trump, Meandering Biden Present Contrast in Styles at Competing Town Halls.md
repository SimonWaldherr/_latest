President Donald Trump and Joe Biden presented starkly different visions, demeanors and temperaments as they fielded town hall questions from voters Thursday night. But Americans could not watch the two presidential nominees side by side because of irreconcilable differences over the very format of what was supposed to be the second presidential debate.

Trump was combative and edgy as he took questions from the public in Miami, chafing under aggressive follow-up questions from NBC moderator Savannah Guthrie. Biden, at an ABC town hall in Philadelphia, never raised his voice as he delivered wonky, sometimes meandering answers about issues ranging from taxes to fracking.

For viewers determined to catch snippets of both presidential candidates, the channel-clicking was like flipping from a bombastic reality TV show to a tame, Sunday morning panel discussion. One town hall seemed to be fueled by Red Bull, the other, carefully hydrated with decaf.

Guthrie, pressing Trump on a conspiracy theory tweet he shared, reminded him that he was president and "not someone's crazy uncle." Former Trump White House communications official Mercedes Schlapp tweeted that watching Biden was like viewing "Mr. Rogers Neighborhood" – a description buttressed by Biden's utterance of such phrases as "I'm not kidding, folks" and "Well, I'll be darned."

Biden, who is leading by double digits in many national polls and is ahead in polls in most battleground states, did what he needed to do: make little or no news, and appear reasonable and dignified.

Trump was defensive and sparred frequently with Guthrie, who repeatedly challenged the president's answers and pressed him on subjects such as his taxes and attitude toward white supremacist and conspiracy theorist groups. Contentious exchanges between the two involving frequent interruptions on both sides took up much of the time allotted for the event. There was no such tension between Biden and ABC's George Stephanopoulos, who pressed for details and reined in Biden when the former vice president went off on a long story but did not push back aggressively.

The competing town halls emerged when Trump refused to go along with a new, remote format decided by the Commission on Presidential Debates to control the spread of COVID-19. Trump was hospitalized several days after contracting the virus.

Biden jumped at ABC's offer to hold a town hall with him alone during the originally scheduled debate time, and Trump later negotiated his own town hall – at the same hour – on NBC.

The only new revelation in the Biden town hall was the Democratic nominee's statement that he would reveal his position on court-packing before the election. Biden reiterated that he is "not a fan" of the idea of adding Supreme Court justices to balance out conservatives Trump has appointed to the court, but he said he wanted to see how the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett was "handled" before he announced a decision.

One of Biden's more awkward moments was when a young Black student asked why African Americans should vote for him. Biden talked about economic opportunity and funding for higher education but did not talk about racial justice issues. After Stephanopoulos asked the young man if his question was answered, he responded, "I guess so."

Biden then offered to stay after the town hall to talk to the student further.

Asked about the consuming issue of the year and the election – the COVID-19 pandemic – Biden rattled off his plan and said everyone should be required to wear masks. Pressed, he said he'd talk to governors to get them to do it and, if that failed, would go to mayors and city council members.

Trump was evasive on questions related to his coronavirus diagnosis and still wouldn't answer the last time he tested negative before contracting the virus. He also said he couldn't recall if he was tested the day of the first presidential debate, adding that he tests "quite a bit" but not on a daily basis.

He continued to express skepticism over wearing masks as a preventive measure and defended his decisions to keep holding crowded rallies and events. Trump also argued that the virus is "rounding the corner" despite a recent rise in cases and the U.S. death toll exceeding 217,000.

"I can't be locked in a very beautiful room somewhere in the White House," Trump said. "What we've done has been amazing. It's rounding the corner. Vaccines and therapies coming."

Trump grew exceedingly frustrated by questions about whether he would denounce white supremacy, lashing out at Guthrie for probing him on the issue and not raising a similar question in regard to Antifa with Biden. Eventually, the president said he denounces white supremacy and has done so "for years." The president stopped short of such a declaration at the first presidential debate.

Trump also passed on an opportunity to disavow the QAnon conspiracy – a once fringe idea that has become more mainstream among Trump supporters. After he said he was unaware of the group, Guthrie repeatedly pushed back and briefly described to him the conspiracy theory that has been classified as a domestic terrorist threat by the FBI.

"I know nothing about QAnon," Trump said. "What I do know about it is they are very strongly against pedophilia and I agree with that."

At one point, Guthrie pressed Trump on retweeting conspiracy theories surrounding the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. When he said that people can make up their minds what to believe, she appeared baffled by his response.

"I don't get that. You're the president," Guthrie said. "You're not like someone's crazy uncle who can just retweet whatever."

While Trump dodged some questions, he did engage in questions about an investigation by The New York Times about his tax returns and the $421 million in debt he owes. He accused the newspaper of getting the numbers "all wrong" but appeared to acknowledge the existence of debt. When Guthrie asked if he's confirming the debt, Trump didn't directly answer but said that the amount is insignificant compared to his assets.

"When you look at vast properties like I have … the amount of money, $400 million, is a peanut," said Trump, who also said that he "probably" owes money to a foreign bank after being pressed.

Biden, meanwhile, spent some time knocking down what he saw as inaccurate descriptions of his own policy positions. No, he didn't want to ban fracking, the former vice president told the voters in Pennsylvania, where fracking is an important industry.

No, he didn't what to "defund" the police, Biden told another voter. And, no, he wasn't going to raise taxes on the middle class by getting rid of Trump's entire tax cut, the former vice president assured yet another voter. Biden has indeed said he would "repeal" Trump's tax cut, while also saying he would not raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year. Thursday night, he said he meant only the top-tier earners would have their tax cuts repealed.

Asked why undecided voters should cast ballots for him, Trump was defiantly confident. "Because I've done a great job," the president said. "We have the strongest economy in the world. The vaccines are coming out soon. We've rebuilt our military and our borders. There was no nothing before. And the greatest tax and regulations cuts in history, too."

Biden, asked what it would say about America if Trump indeed won a second term, was more reflective.

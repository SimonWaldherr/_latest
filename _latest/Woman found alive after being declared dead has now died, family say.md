<p>Beauchamp&#8217;s family, who live in Southfield, called 911 on 23 August because she appeared to be suffering from serious breathing problems.</p>
<p>Emergency medical technicians and paramedics responded, and a doctor who didn&#8217;t attend the scene pronounced Beauchamp deceased after one of the first responders reported by telephone that she had been <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2020/09/25/police-records-paramedics-performed-cpr-for-30-minutes-on-southfield-woman-wrongly-declared-dead/" class="u-underline">unresponsive for 30 minutes</a> and showed no signs of life.</p>
<p>Beauchamp was not taken to a hospital until an hour later when Cole Funeral Home in Detroit called 911.</p>
<p>The state said funeral home staff saw her chest moving when they went to collect her from her Southfield home.</p>
<p>She had been hospitalized in critical condition ever since. </p>
<p>Beauchamp&#8217;s family said in a statement that they were &#8220;devastated&#8221; by her death.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the second time our beloved Timesha has been pronounced dead, but this time she isn&#8217;t coming back,&#8221; the family said.</p>
<p>Beauchamp had cerebral palsy and several other medical issues. The family <a href="https://www.dailytribune.com/news/local/lawsuit-seeks-50-000-000-plus-on-behalf-of-southfield-woman-mistakenly-declared-dead/article_3a07c6d6-75b3-585b-ba0c-66b5666d674d.html" class="u-underline">has filed</a> a $50m federal lawsuit against the city of Southfield and the four first responders who attended to Beauchamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;She died as a result of massive brain damage that was suffered when Southfield paramedics wrongly declared her dead, and failed to provide her much-needed oxygen,&#8221; Fieger said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead, she was sent to a funeral home which then discovered that her eyes were open, and that she was alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Southfield fire department chief, Johnny Menifee, has said the city was investigating the case.</p>
<p>He told reporters in late August that Beauchamp might have been found alive due to &#8220;Lazarus syndrome&#8221;, also known as auto-resuscitation, in which people come back to life without assistance after attempts to resuscitate them have failed.</p>

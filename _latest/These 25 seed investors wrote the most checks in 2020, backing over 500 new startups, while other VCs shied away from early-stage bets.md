<p>When the pandemic first shut down the U.S. economy in March, it was first-time founders who took the hardest hit in the world of venture capital.</p><p>Investors pivoted away from more uncertain, early-stage bets, and a drop in seed deals accounted for <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/venture-capital-seed-funding-q1-2020/">nearly 80%</a> of the decline in deals in the first quarter, according to research from the National Venture Capital Association.</p><p>Though that sluggish pace has continued, Business Insider went in search of the investors bucking the trend. We asked Pitchbook to name 2020's 25 most active seed funds so far this year and we discovered that they have made over 500 investments in startups from fields ranging from fintech to healthcare to education.</p><p>While seed stalwarts like Y Combinator and Greycroft predictably made the list, there are also a few funds that are not as well known.&#160;</p><p>For instance, the most prolific seed fund in 2020 so far, according to this data, is Innovation Works. It's a Pittsburgh fund dedicated to startups in Southwestern Pennsylvania supported by the state's Department of Community and Economic Development.</p><p class="insider-raw-embed"></p><p>To no one's surprise, most of these seed funds are concentrated in California's Bay Area, with tech hub New York in second place. But there are also a few outliers: Jumpstart Health Investors, for example, is based in Nashville, Tennessee, and Global Founders Capital is all the way out in Germany.</p><p>What the data show is that, even in a year like 2020 when funding for first-time founders was harder to come by, there are VCs ready, willing and able to write checks, for those who know where to look.</p><p class="insider-raw-embed"></p><p>&#160;</p>

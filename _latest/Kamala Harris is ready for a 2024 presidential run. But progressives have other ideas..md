<li><strong>Kamala Harris' critics are already thinking about who might challenge her in a 2024 Democratic primary. </strong></li>

<p>Joe Biden didn't just select a running mate earlier this summer to help him beat President Donald Trump. He also picked the Democratic party's 2024 presidential front-runner.</p><p>Now Kamala Harris just needs the progressives to get on board.</p><p>The liberal left is anything but excited about the prospect of Harris, a former prosecutor-turned-senator, being the de facto pick to lead the Democratic ticket during the inevitable next White House campaign that begins right around the same time the balloons and confetti fall on the stage of the eventual 2020 winner.&#160;</p><p>This might all sound like drape measuring. But Harris' promotion prospects are a direct byproduct of the fact she'd be serving under Biden, who if he wins the presidency would be the oldest person to ever hold the job and already faces questions over whether he'd declare himself a lame duck who isn't running for reelection.&#160;</p><p>Most progressive Democrats will only say publicly that it's crazy to speculate about Harris' presidential prospects. But they also know the 55-year old has bigger ambitions. She did run for the job once after all. And they're already kicking around names in private about who should mount a campaign from the left challenging a Vice President Harris in 2024, according to nine Democratic operatives interviewed by Insider.</p><p>Prospects already being floated include liberal superstars New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who would reach the constitutionally-mandated age threshold of 35 in 2024, and the widely-recognizable Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Also in the mix: progressive California Reps. Ro Khanna and Katie Porter, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams, who ran for Georgia governor in 2018.&#160;</p><p>"I don't think that Harris satisfies the appetite of the progressive wing of the party," said Heather Gautney, who was a senior policy adviser to Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign and later worked on a team that included the Vermont senator's supporters who drafted policy recommendations for the Biden campaign.</p><p>

</p><h2><strong>'It has to be another woman of color'</strong></h2><p>The party's left flank has misgivings about Harris' career as a local and state prosecutor in California and her shifting position as a senator on Medicare for All, which she supported but backed away from during the 2020 presidential primaries.&#160;</p>
<p id="gpt-post-politics-mobile_in_post_ad-fluid-2" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-mobile"></p>

<p id="gpt-post-politics-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-2" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p>Gautney, who served as an aide in Sanders' Capitol Hill office when Harris was the first senator to sign on as a co-sponsor of Sanders' Medicare for All bill, took issue with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/29/746051105/kamala-harris-releases-medicare-for-all-plan-with-a-role-for-private-insurers">Harris for backtracking</a> on the proposal during the campaign.&#160;</p><p>"We don't know exactly where she is on some of these things now," she said.&#160;</p><p>Harris' record as a prosecutor is a major sticking point for many on the left. She's now <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-06-08/democrats-police-reform-bill-would-ban-choke-holds-ease-civil-lawsuits-against-officers">spearheading police reform legislation</a> in the Senate that would crack down on the use of chokeholds and no-knock warrants, but she has also called for more cops on the streets.&#160;</p><p>In her 2009 book, "Smart on Crime," Harris wrote that "if we take a show of hands of those who would like to see more police officers on the street, mine would shoot up," the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-policing.html">New York Times reported</a>. She said that "virtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see officers walking a beat."</p><p>But for all the differences on policy, Harris' critics concede it would be tough from a political standpoint for any other Democrats to challenge a barrier-breaking woman of color who would also be serving as the nation's first woman vice president.&#160;</p><p>"I think the only way you challenge Kamala Harris from the left &#8212; it has to be another woman of color," said another Sanders supporter.</p><p><strong>

</strong></p><h2><strong>The left will be watching</strong></h2><p>Democrats are displaying a panicked sense of urgency to stay unified and win back the presidency from Donald Trump. Many are therefore giving Harris a pass on policy differences &#8212; for now, at least.</p><p>"I do not know anybody" who's criticizing Harris "because they so desperately want Joe to win," said Barbara O'Connor, the former director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University-Sacramento.&#160;&#160;<strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p id="gpt-post-politics-mobile_in_post_ad-fluid-3" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-mobile"></p>

<p id="gpt-post-politics-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-3" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p>"I think everybody's in the same boat," added O'Connor, who's well connected in California Democratic circles and has been following Harris' career for years.&#160;</p><p>Some progressives say they are willing to give Harris a chance as vice president but note she should also work to distance herself from Biden's more moderate governing approach. That could be challenging for her since it is Biden who would be the commander in chief, and the president's team would be watching closely to ensure Harris remains a team player.&#160;</p><p>"She has a couple of years if &#8212; I don't want to get ahead of ourselves &#8212; if we win, to really show the progressive left movement base, the African-American, Latinx and criminal justice reform community, that she's willing to stand up," said Scott Goodstein, an activist and former digital strategist for Barack Obama and Sanders' presidential campaigns.&#160;</p><p><strong>&#160;</strong>Goodstein said the first two years will show whether Harris chooses to take a more centrist route as vice president.</p><p>"Kamala has this unique opportunity to actually, instead of pushing to the center and right like she has done for her career, she could actually show the base and those that have been fighting for issues on the left that she can get things done and be a leader on these issues," Goodstein said. "And I think if she does that, she would be in a clear frontrunner position."</p><p>Her vice presidential portfolio would depend largely on what Biden opted to give her. For now, it remains to be seen whether Harris would spearhead major policy initiatives in his administration in the way that Vice President Mike Pence handled the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic or Biden as vice president under President Barack Obama spearheaded the 2009 implementation of an $830 billion economic stimulus package.&#160;</p><p>Rep. Robin Kelly, an Illinois Democrat who has worked with Harris on Capitol Hill, says she expects the California senator to play a major role in setting criminal justice and healthcare policy under a Biden administration.&#160;</p><p>"She's a smart woman, so she can be wherever she wants to be," said Kelly, who worked earlier this year on the Biden-Sanders unity task force that developed policy recommendations.&#160;</p>

<p>Harris has plenty of critics in Washington and in California Democratic circles who point to the widely publicized <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/03/spectacular-collapse-kamala-harris-2020-074982">dysfunction</a> of her presidential campaign, her struggle to break through to voters with a consistent message, and complaints about her management of staff.&#160;</p><p>But Harris also has a huge fan club, including a substantial chunk of voters who would be thrilled to have the first woman of color as vice president. She has a loyal social media following, known as the #KHive.&#160;</p><p>Should Harris decide to make another run at the White House, there's no better place to build up her name recognition &#8212; and prove that she's got the chops &#8212; than by serving four or eight years as vice president.&#160;</p><p>The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment about Biden's relationship with Harris on the campaign trail, his plans to run for a second term, and about whether they have discussed plans for future presidential campaigns.</p><p>

</p><h2><strong>Trying to be a Biden team player</strong></h2><p>On the campaign trail, Biden and Harris have tried to show a tight-knit friendship after questions about her loyalty to him surfaced during the veepstakes. Harris has given the public the impression that she's a dutiful soldier on Team Biden. She's taken on a hectic swing-state travel schedule, she's been active on the fundraising circuit, and says she's thrilled to work with her former rival.&#160;</p><p>Democratic insiders say she's trying to prove she'll be a team player in a Biden White House.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>"When Kamala Harris was running for president, she was the focus and the center of that campaign," said Roger Salazar, a longtime Democratic strategist and California political insider.&#160;</p><p>"When you are the vice presidential nominee, you are playing a supporting role. You're part of the team that are all focused on getting the ticket elected," added Salazar, who worked in the Clinton White House and for then-Vice President Al Gore.&#160;</p>

<p>Of course, the main part of a vice president's job is to take over the job if needed. In US history, 14 <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Vice_President.htm">vice presidents have become president </a>&#8212; eight of them took the office after the death of a president.&#160;</p><p>Harris already is on track to become vice president under the oldest sitting president ever elected. Biden would be 78 on Inauguration Day and 81 if he ran again in 2024. Biden has not publicly said he would only serve one-term and his <a href="https://twitter.com/KBeds/status/1204793252337065984?s=20">campaign shot down </a>reports he considered making such a pledge.&#160;</p><p>The two would also enter the White House during a pandemic that's more dangerous for the elderly and following a 2020 race where Trump, his wife and more than a dozen other top White House and campaign staff were diagnosed as having gotten the contagious and potentially fatal disease. Harris will therefore instantly be under more scrutiny than recent vice presidents such as Pence and even Biden, who had the job when Hillary Clinton was widely viewed as the likely Democratic successor to Obama.&#160;</p><p>That means the speculation about Harris' career prospects &#8212; and the challenges that go along with another national political campaign where the incumbent has proclaimed himself a lame duck &#8212; will only intensify if she's in the White House next January alongside Biden.&#160;</p><p>"If you're the vice president, there are going to be eyes on you as a potential candidate for presidency &#8212; you're one rung below the job that everyone is seeking," Salazar said. "It's natural to look at a sitting vice president as the ranking contender for the number one slot."</p>

  E-bike subscription service Dance closes $17.7M Series A, led by HV Holtzbrinck Ventures – TechCrunch 
description: > 
  Three months on since the former founders of SoundCloud launched their e-bike subscription service, Dance they are today announcing the close of a $17.7 million (€15 million) Series A funding round led by one of the larger European VCs, HV Holtzbrinck Ventures.Founded by Eric Quidenus-Wahlforss (ex-Soundcloud), Alexander Ljung (ex-Soundcloud) and Christian Springub (ex-Jimdo), Dance has ambitions to offer its all-inclusive service subscription package into expanded markets across Europe and eventually the US.Dance is currently operating the invite-only pilot of its e-bike subscription in Berlin, with plans for a broader launch, expanded accessibility and availability and new cities next year.Unfortunately, the majority of e-bikes on the market today have some combination of poor design, high upfront costs, and cumbersome maintenance.This comes with maintenance, theft replacement insurance, a dedicated smartphone app, concierge services, GPS location tracking and unlocking capabilities.

<div><p id="speakable-summary">Three months on since the former founders of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/soundcloud" target="_blank">SoundCloud </a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/former-soundcloud-founders-launch-e-bike-subscription-service-backed-by-blueyard/">launched</a> their e-bike subscription service, <a href="https://www.dance.co/">Dance</a> they are today announcing the close of a $17.7 million (&#8364;15 million) Series A funding round led by one of the larger European VCs, HV Holtzbrinck Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded by Eric Quidenus-Wahlforss (ex-Soundcloud), <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/alexander-ljung" target="_blank">Alexander Ljung </a> (ex-Soundcloud) and Christian Springub (ex-Jimdo), Dance has ambitions to offer its all-inclusive service subscription package into expanded markets across Europe and eventually the US. Dance is currently operating the invite-only pilot of its e-bike subscription in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/berlin" target="_blank">Berlin, </a> with plans for a broader launch, expanded accessibility and availability and new cities next year.&#160;</p>
<p>Rainer M&#228;rkle, general partner at HV Holtzbrinck Ventures said in a statement: &#8220;The mobility market is seeing a huge shift towards bikes, strongly fueled by the paradigm shift of vehicles going electric. Unfortunately, the majority of e-bikes on the market today have some combination of poor design, high upfront costs, and cumbersome maintenance. We analyzed the overall mobility market, evaluated all means of transport, and crunched the numbers on all types of business models for a few years before we found what we were looking for. Dance is by the far the most viable future of biking, bridging the gap between e-bike ownership and more &#8216;joyful&#8217; accessibility to go places.&#8221;</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>E-bikes tend to be notoriously expensive to purchase and a hassle to repair. That said, startups like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vanmoof" target="_blank">VanMoof </a> and Cowboy have brought an <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank">Apple </a>-esque business model to the market which is fast bringing the cost of full ownership down.</p>
<p>Most commuters are put off cycling the average 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) commute but e-bikes make this distance a breeze. Dance sits in that half-way house between owning an expensive bike and having to hunt down a rentable ebike or electric scooter close to your location.</p>
<p>Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought individual, socially distanced, transport into sharp relief. UK sales of e-bikes have boomed, seeing a&#160;230% <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/08/electric-bike-and-scooter-sales-boom-pushes-halford-back-to-growth-covid-19">surge</a>&#160;in demand over the summer. This has happened at the same time as EU governments have put in more than&#160;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54353914">2300km</a> of bike lanes, with the UK alone pledging&#160;&#163;250 million in investment.</p>
<p>Quidenus-Wahlforss said the startup has been &#8220;inundated with positive responses from around the world since we announced our invite-only pilot program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dance&#8217;s subscription model includes a fully assembled e-bike delivered to a subscriber&#8217;s door within 24 hours. This comes with maintenance, theft replacement insurance, a dedicated smartphone app, concierge services, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gps-3a87" target="_blank">GPS </a> location tracking and unlocking capabilities.</p>

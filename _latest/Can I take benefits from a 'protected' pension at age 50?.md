  Can I take benefits from a 'protected' pension at age 50? 
description: > 
  Early retirement question: I have a £1m-plus pension pot and my scheme says I can take benefits from age 50 - but isn't the minimum age 55?When the pension transferred to Standard Life I was told in the transfer documentation that I have a protected minimum pension age that means that I can retire from the scheme from age 50, subject to certain restrictions.Looking to the future, as I wrote in a column earlier this year, the Government’s plan is to increase that age to 57 in 2028 when the state pension age rises to 67.Those who meet the various tests – and it sounds as though your pension comes in this category – have what is called a ‘protected’ pension age which can be under 55.Apart from people who have old pensions with a ‘protected’ pension age under 55, and the very limited exceptions listed above, you are not meant to access your pension before age 55.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">There are however additional rules to keep your protected pension age, including a requirement to move all of the money in one go when you do withdraw it, and you should check with your scheme what these mean for you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given the size of your pension pot, I would assume that you could afford to take expert independent financial advice and would encourage you to do so, given the sums involved and the complexity of the rules.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The other very limited exceptions to the rules around accessing pensions at age 55 include, as you suggest, those who are very seriously ill and sportsmen and women whose professional career can end at an early age and to whom special rules can apply.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are two important points for anyone to bear in mind who is thinking of accessing their pension at a relatively early age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first is that just because you can access a pension early it does not mean that this is a good idea. A man aged 50 is likely on average to live to 84 and has a one in four chance of living to 93.

<p>Pratt&#8217;s Marvel co-stars &#8212; as well as his wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger &#8212; felt compelled to defend him after <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/chris-pratt-is-the-worst-hollywood-chris-twitter-decides" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter jokingly voted Pratt the &#8220;worst&#8221; Chris</a> in Hollywood. The fun, lighthearted challenge pegged the &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy&#8221; star, 41, against fellow Hollywood hunks Chris Pine, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth &#8212; and left Pratt&#8217;s crew pretty peeved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this really what we need? There&#8217;s so much going on in the world and people struggling in so many ways. Being mean is so yesterday,&#8221; Schwarzenegger, Pratt&#8217;s wife, commented on an Instagram post discussing the social media battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s enough room to love all these guys. Love is what we all need not meanness and bullying. Let&#8217;s try that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr., who portrayed Iron Man in the Marvel &#8220;Avengers&#8221; series, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGlMURZlYWZ/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared a picture</a> of himself working with Pratt on set and defended Pratt&#8217;s political and religious values.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a world&#8230; The &#8216;sinless&#8217; are casting stones at my #brother, Chris Pratt&#8230; A real #Christian who lives by #principle, has never demonstrated anything but #positivity and #gratitude&#8230; AND he just married into a family that makes space for civil discourse and (just plain fact) INSISTS on service as the highest value,&#8221; Downey Jr. wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you take issue with Chris,,, I&#8217;ve got a novel idea. Delete your social media accounts, sit with your OWN defects of #character, work on THEM, then celebrate your humanness&#8230; @prattprattpratt I #gotyerbackbackback.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, assured fans that Pratt is &#8220;as solid a man there is&#8221; and somehow managed to tie in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know him personally, and instead of casting aspersions, look at how he lives his life,&#8221; Ruffalo <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/1318646841324560385" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>. &#8220;He is just not overtly political as a rule. This is a distraction. Let&#8217;s keep our eyes on the prize, friends. We are so close now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoe Saldana, who plays Gamora in &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy,&#8221; quoted late rapper Tupac Shakur in defending her friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No matter how hard it gets, stick your chest out, keep your head up and handle it.&#8217; -Tupac</p>
<p>&#8220;You got this @prattprattpratt. Your family, friends, colleagues &amp; everyone who&#8217;s ever crossed paths with you knows your heart and your worth!&#8221; she <a href="https://twitter.com/zoesaldana/status/1318722737053913088" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like a super-sensitive superhero.</p>

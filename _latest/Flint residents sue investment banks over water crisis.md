New York (CNN) Residents of Flint, Michigan, have filed a civil lawsuit against three investment banks for claims arising from the poisoning of "minors, residents and water users of the City of Flint during the period when Flint utilized the Flint River as a primary water source without implementing proper corrosion controls," according to a complaint in federal court.

Prior lawsuits regarding the Flint water crisis have been ongoing for years against various government officials and environmental engineering companies that were involved in the decision to switch the water source in Flint.

JPMorgan Chase JPM Wells Fargo CBEAX This complaint allegesand Stifel, Nicolaus & Company in 2014 "underwrote the bond sale that financed and enabled Flint's participation in the Karegnondi Water Authority" pipeline. The bond sale "aided and abetted the perpetration of the violation of Plaintiffs' firmly established constitutional right to bodily integrity," the complaint says.

The complaint, filed at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that without the bond backed by the three investment banks, Flint would not have been able to pay for the KWA pipeline. According to the complaint, "J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Stifel agreed to underwrite the bond financing ... and facilitated a plan for Flint to leave the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department ("DWSD") and enter the KWA, and they knew that a necessary element of the plan was the use of raw, untreated Flint River water as an interim drinking water source, which would expose Flint's residents and water users to lead-poisoning and legionella bacteria."

The three banks "each engaged in conscience shocking behavior by underwriting Flint's participation in the KWA—and thus the poisoning of Flint's children, residents, and other users—knowing full well there would be drastic and dire health consequences to the children of Flint," the complaint states.

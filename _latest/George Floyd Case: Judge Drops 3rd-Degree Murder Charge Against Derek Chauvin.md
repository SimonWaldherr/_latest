<p><strong>Updated at 11:40 a.m. ET</strong></p>   <p>A Minneapolis judge has dismissed the third-degree murder charge against Derek Chauvin, one of the four former police officers facing criminal charges in the May killing of George Floyd.</p>   <p>Chauvin, who was captured on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes, still faces a higher charge of second-degree murder. Chauvin's legal team filed a motion to have both charges dropped, but the latter was denied. </p>   <p>The dismissal will be stayed for five days to allow state prosecutors to consider a pretrial appeal, <a href="https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12646/Order10212020.pdf">according to court documents</a>.</p>   <p>Three other former Minneapolis officers &#8212; Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and Alexander Kueng &#8212; face charges of aiding and abetting murder in the killing of Floyd. They also sought to have their complaints dismissed for lack of probable cause.</p>   <p>However, Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill denied each of their motions. </p>   <p>The judge agreed with Chauvin's defense team that third-degree murder did not apply in this case. Cahill said prosecutors were only able to prove two of the three elements required for the charge: that Floyd died and that Chauvin caused Floyd's death.</p>   <p>But the final element of probable cause for third-degree murder involves proving that the defendant was putting people other than the victim at risk, Cahill said. </p>   <p>Because Chauvin's actions were directed only at Floyd and could not have resulted in harm of anyone else, the judge said, "probable cause does not exist for the third-degree murder charge."</p>   <p>"Third-degree murder is an unusual, uncommon count that some defense attorneys have said didn't suit the Floyd case," the <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ex-officers-to-go-to-trial-1-charge-dropped/572827792/">Star Tribute reported</a>. "Some attorneys have said the charge best fits a situation such as a person randomly shooting into a moving train and killing someone."</p>   
    

    <p id="ad-backstage-News_National" class="ad-backstage"></p>

   <p>Cahill is still considering whether to try all four former officers together, which was not included in the most recent court filings, according to the Star Tribune.<strong> </strong>The newspaper also noted that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office has signaled it does not want to try the officers separately.</p>   <p>Earlier this month, Cahill issued an order <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/10/09/922477177/derek-chauvin-can-await-murder-trial-out-of-state-amid-safety-concerns">changing the terms</a> of Chauvin's bond, allowing him to leave the state because of "safety concerns."</p>   <p>Chauvin was released from jail after posting a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/10/07/921213607/derek-chauvin-is-released-on-1-million-bail-bond">$1 million bond</a>. Law enforcement officials said <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/10/08/921810603/51-arrested-in-minneapolis-protests-following-derek-chauvins-release">51 people were arrested</a> at demonstrations following his release.</p>   <p>Floyd's death sparked protests worldwide calling for an end to police brutality and systemic racism. It also triggered days of protests in Minneapolis. </p>   <p>Like Chauvin, the three other former officers involved in the Floyd killing have been released from jail on bond. </p>   <p>Their trial is expected to start in March.</p>

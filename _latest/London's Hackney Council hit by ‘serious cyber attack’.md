Hackney Council has been hit by a "serious cyber attack" which has affected many of its services and IT systems.

An investigation into the attack is still at an early stage, and the council said it is working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) understand the "impact of the incident".

It is not yet clear if any resident data was exposed, or who was behind the attack. However, the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office said it had received a data breach report from the council and would be making enquiries.

A spokesman for Hackney Council said: "Our focus is on continuing to deliver essential frontline services, especially to our most vulnerable residents, and protecting data, while restoring affected services as soon as possible."

The NCSC added: "We are aware of an incident affecting Hackney Borough Council.

“The NCSC is supporting the organisation and working with partners to understand the impact of this incident.”

Hackney Council is the local government authority for the borough of Hackney in London, home to more than 250,000 residents.

Neighbourhoods such as Shoreditch have proved popular for those working in creative industries, and famous residents of Hackney include pantomime icon Christopher Biggins and award-winning singer songwriter Laura Mvula.

Hackney Council's online services are often used by members of the public to complete tasks such as pay their council tax, and register births and deaths.

The council said its systems may be unavailable or slower than normal as it seeks to understand more about the cyber attack.

The council asked that "residents and businesses only contact us if absolutely necessary, and to bear with us while we seek to resolve these issues".

Speculation over what may have been the cause of the attack was rife on Tuesday, with some wondering whether it was an issue with the domain name system, by which internet locations are named, or whether the council had been a victim of a ransomware attack.

Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist at ESET, said: “This bears all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, but what we should be worried about is the new direction that threat actors are taking these days, where they not only encrypt the data but they threaten to release it too.

"Councils which may lack funding, and consequently may not have the strongest network protection, can be an easy target for those looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. Unfortunately, there is big money to be made and criminal hackers are quick to adapt and make their crime pay.”

In February, Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council was hit by a ransomware attack, which cost the council £10m.

In 2018, Cumbrian council Copeland Borough revealed that an attack on its systems cost it about £2m. That attack locked staff out of various council services, including payroll, planning, and environmental health.

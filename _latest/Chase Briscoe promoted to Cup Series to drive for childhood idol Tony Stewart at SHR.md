Stewart explained:</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"When he makes a mistake he will spend more time reflecting on that mistake, unfortunately, than he does the rest of the good things that he does all day. But that's kind of the way I was in my career too. I felt minimizing mistakes was the key to winning races and championships, and that's also the same mindset that Chase has as well.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"He's very, very diligent about making sure he learns from everything that happens on the race track, and he's got a pretty good memory bank to hold all of that knowledge in. So he's great about realizing when he makes a mistake and then analyzing what happened, why did he make the mistake and what can he do to correct it for the next time. That's something that I had to try to do through my career as well."</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Chase Briscoe celebrates after winning the Kansas Lottery 300 Xfinity Series race, Oct. 17 at Kansas Speedway."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Like Stewart, Briscoe also has experience in a variety of racing disciplines, including the NASCAR Truck Series, sports cars in IMSA and dirt tracks. He has, however, never competed in the Cup Series, even in a one-off event. So his Cup debut as a rookie will be the 2021 Daytona 500 in February.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But Stewart also said he and his team are looking at the bigger picture.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I feel like even if the first year is a struggle for him, we're committed to him, and we're gonna make sure we get him where he needs to be," Stewart explained. "And I think we will have a lot of success with him down the road."</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/nascar/2013/08/06/tony-stewart-through-the-years/1938667/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t"></p></a></div>

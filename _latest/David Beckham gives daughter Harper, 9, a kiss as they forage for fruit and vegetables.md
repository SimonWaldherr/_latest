  David Beckham gives daughter Harper, 9, a kiss as they forage for fruit and vegetables 
description: > 
  David Beckham enjoyed some quality time with his daughter Harper, as they spent the day foraging for fruits and vegetables.In one family snap, David was seen giving Harper a kiss on the lips as they posed for a photo with the autumnal wreaths they also made.While many had branded the picture 'beautiful' and a depiction of the 'close bond' he has with Harper, David was also hit with a barrage of negative comments as others claimed the post had been 'disgusting'.Baffled by the strong reaction it received, David addressed his photo with Harper and said: 'I kiss all my kids on the lips.'Doting dad: This isn't the first time David has shared a photo of himself kissing daughter on the lips, which has previously led him to come under fire from trolls

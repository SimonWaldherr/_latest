<div><p>The Trump campaign is teaming up with the Ultimate Fighting Championship to occupy some critical internet space during Thursday&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/commission-will-mute-mics-during-final-debate-between-trump-biden/">final presidential debate</a> by taking over YouTube&#8217;s masthead for 24 hours, according to a report.</p>
<p>The ad buy will include two from the UFC urging people to vote in person on Nov. 3, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-takes-over-youtube-masthead-for-debate-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The upcoming election is a fight for the future of our country,&#8221; UFC President Dana White says in the ad. &#8220;President Trump built the greatest economy in American history and since COVID hit, he saved our economy from total collapse and is rebuilding it all over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another spot features UFC star Jorge Masvidal saying Democrats shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;entitled&#8221; to the Latino vote and hitting Joe Biden for <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/16/biden-plays-despacito-at-event-in-florida-to-rally-latino-support/">playing &#8220;Despacito&#8221;</a> at a campaign rally in Florida.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what else is not going to work for [Latinos] &#8211; playing &#8216;Despacito&#8217; on your cell phone to pander to us. Hell no! You got to give us some credit for having heads on our shoulders,&#8221; Masvidal says in the ad.</p>
<p>Both White and Masvidal, whose father fled Cuba to escape Fidel Castro&#8217;s rule, have spoken in support for President Trump at rallies.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has secured the YouTube masthead for most of the remaining days of the election.</p>
<p>It also took over the masthead for the first debate last month.</p>
<p>Team Biden <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/30/biden-camp-launches-online-ad-campaign-following-debate-report/">countered</a>&#160;by launching a &#8220;Take Back the Internet&#8221; campaign that began the night of the Sept. 29 debate.</p>
<p>Trump and Biden will square off for their final debate at 9 p.m. at Belmont University in Nashville.</p>

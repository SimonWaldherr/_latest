Hailey Bieber's dad Stephen Baldwin has come out in support of President Donald Trump several times.

But the model makes sure to separate herself from her father's views, especially during election year.

She endorsed Democratic nominee Joe Biden as she took to Instagram Saturday for World Mental Health Day, sporting a blue tie-dye t-shirt from his campaign, tied at the waist.

The 23-year-old wrote: 'It’s world mental health day, and something that has affected my mental health is the state of our country and the future of our country.

'I have hope, but we need to collectively make the change we want for our future and that means getting out there to VOTE!!!'

Stephen, 54, appeared to subtweet his own daughter, later writing on Twitter: 'don’t talk much about family pray 4 everyone every day! in my [heart emoji] beauty of [American flag emoji]

'“land of #free home of #brave” is ... reverence 4 our freedom, importance of clarity of vote? (vision goal truth intent) Many are called, few are chosen! Gospel is truth. battle already won #Trump2020'

State of the country: The 23-year-old wrote: 'It’s world mental health day, and something that has affected my mental health is the state of our country and the future of our country'

Daddy's girl: Hailey has been careful to distinguish her views from those of her Bio-Dome actor dad in the past, telling The Sunday Times in March of 2017: 'We didn’t see eye to eye. It was a very big issue for me, but my dad’s still my dad. I would never let politics get in the way of family'

Hailey has been careful to distinguish her views from those of her Bio-Dome actor dad in the past.

Hailey told The Sunday Times in March of 2017: 'We didn’t see eye to eye. It was a very big issue for me, but my dad’s still my dad. I would never let politics get in the way of family.

'It’s over now, and his opinions have changed with how everything’s now unfolding. Every day, the news freaks me out. It’s terrifying.'

But pops has maintained his position in Trump's corner, which has also caused contention with brother Alec, 62, who hasn't held back with his portrayal of the 45th president on Saturday Night Live.

Stephen told The Hollywood Reporter in December of 2017 of the state of his relationship with Alec: 'I can’t get into it. I haven’t spoken to him since the election.

'That’s the truth. That is by his choice. We grew up in a dumb-jock, competitive, Friday Night Lights kind of environment. And I’m sorry, Paul, but my guy won. Sorry. That’s what happened.'

He added: 'I’m calling it now: With the amount of money Alec is going to make with this new tax cut, I bet he votes for Trump for re-election. Just saying!'

Estranged brothers: Stephen told The Hollywood Reporter in December of 2017 of the state of his relationship with Alec: 'I can’t get into it. I haven’t spoken to him since the election. That’s the truth. That is by his choice' (pictured with brothers Billy and Stephen in November, 2010)

Everybody's a critic: Alec previously told The Guardian that July: 'I’ve got a menu of different jobs… with some Trump every now and then! Everyone’s loving it… my brother Stephen, not so much. He’s a big rightwing Republican' (pictured in February, 2020)

Dirty laundry: Stephen also publicly feuded with brother Billy Baldwin, 57, back in October of 2016: 'If our father were alive today… he'd smack you in the side of the head for supporting Donald Trump' (pictured in February, 2019)

Alec previously told The Guardian that July: 'I’ve got a menu of different jobs… with some Trump every now and then! Everyone’s loving it… my brother Stephen, not so much. He’s a big rightwing Republican.'

His hilarious Trump impersonation earned him an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series back in 2017.

Stephen also publicly feuded with brother Billy Baldwin, 57, back in October of 2016, just weeks before Trump was elected president.

He wrote on Twitter: 'If my father were alive today (a veteran) He would be ashamed & disgusted of media biased & manipulation by people like @andersoncooper'

Billy responded: 'If our father were alive today… he'd smack you in the side of the head for supporting Donald Trump.'

Hailey gave an update on the family to The Sunday Times in May of 2018: 'That was a very hurtful situation for me. I love my father, he’s an amazing dad, but we so strongly disagreed on [the election].

'He and my sister strongly disagreed on it. My sister’s husband, like everyone on our side, just doesn’t agree with him. We don’t talk about it now. It’s not worth the argument.'

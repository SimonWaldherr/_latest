It is rare that a conservatory, no matter how splendid, is put to good use, housing an imaginative collection of plants in exquisite containers, with just the right amount of trickling water. Instead, the classic conservatories attached by developers to the sides of houses are too hot or too cold and people, as well as plants, would rather be elsewhere.

An orangery or a tea house are at least further away but they suffer from a similar lack of purpose: what to do when the plants have been wheeled in and out, the tea ceremony is over?

A proper greenhouse is the new destination in gardens, as well as the centrepiece. Just as walled gardens have been restored as growing places for vegetables and flowers, so those in possession of larger country gardens are keen to bring the workings of propagation and plant-raising into full view, signalling a new-found wisdom in plot-to-plate eating, while hinting at self-sufficiency.

The distinguished glasshouse builders, Hartley Botanic, who have been making bespoke structures around the UK, Europe and the United States since the 1930s have noticed in the last few months that a growing customer concern is about ‘not wanting to be caught out again’. When you want to own your own food supply, a utilitarian greenhouse with panes of glass missing will not do; for the next dystopian crisis, a custom-made greenhouse needs to be part of your armoury.

<p>"Ratched" marks a big win for Netflix and Ryan Murphy's partnership after a tepid launch. Murphy landed a deal with the streamer in 2018 worth up to $300 million, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/tvs-first-300m-man-inside-netflixs-blockbuster-ryan-murphy-deal-1099145">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, but "Ratched" is his first Netflix original series that the streamer has revealed viewership numbers for.</p><p>Both <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-series-the-politician-by-ryan-murphy-trashed-by-critics-2019-10">"The Politician"</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-series-hollywood-gets-harsh-critic-reviews-for-ryan-murphy-2020-4">"Hollywood"</a> received poor reviews from critics with 48% and 57% Rotten Tomatoes critic scores respectively, and failed to generate the kind of enthusiasm audiences seem to have for "Ratched." The series also has a better (but still lukewarm) critic score of 61%.</p><p>"Paulson's conniving, manipulative, but occasionally tender-hearted character is fun to watch, especially playing against an absolutely wonderful Cynthia Nixon," Observer's Brandon Katz <a href="https://observer.com/2020/09/netflix-ratched-review-ryan-murphy-sarah-paulson/">wrote</a>.</p>

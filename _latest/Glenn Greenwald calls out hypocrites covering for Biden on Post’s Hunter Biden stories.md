<div><p>Glenn Greenwald is an independent-minded man of the left &#8212; a Pulitzer-winning journalist who was the main conduit for Edward Snowden&#8217;s leaks of US government secrets. He&#8217;s faced down government harassment in Brazil, where he now lives and reports. So his thoughts on The Post&#8217;s Hunter Biden scoops, and the reaction by other media outlets, are well worth considering. And they&#8217;re damning.</p>
<p>Tuesday evening, he <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1318326587834630146" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made these points on Twitter</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Is there a single journalist willing to say with a straight face they believe the emails relating to the Bidens are either fabricated or otherwise fraudulently altered, but the Bidens just aren&#8217;t saying so? There has to be some limits to your willingness to go to bat for them.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;When you report a huge archive, there&#8217;s no way to prove the negative that none of it is altered. You investigate &amp; confirm as much as you can, then use your journalistic judgment. The only way you get confirmation is when the subjects of the reporting don&#8217;t deny the authenticity.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;When we reported the Snowden archive, we knew it was genuine, but breathed a huge sigh of relief when NSA didn&#8217;t claim the docs were fake. The same was true with our Brazil reporting over the last year: publishing private messages from corrupt Bolsonaro officials &amp; prosecutors.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;As a journalist publishing private communications &amp; docs that are incriminating, you know the subjects of the reporting will immediately claim they&#8217;re fake *if the[y] are*. Of course they will: that would kill the reporting! There&#8217;s a reason the Bidens aren&#8217;t claiming they&#8217;re fake.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that the emails &#8212; so far &#8212; reveal a huge scandal. They so far just establish standard sleaze and DC corruption. The huge scandal to me is the blatant rank-closing and cone of silence &#8212; a prohibition &#8212; erected *by journalists* around this story to defend Biden.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/glenn-greenwald-on-tucker-carlson-calls-adam-schiff-the-most-pathological-liar-in-all-of-american-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On Tucker Carlson&#8217;s Fox News show</a> that night, he elaborated:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;What makes it so much worse is that the reason the Bidens aren&#8217;t answering basic questions about this story &#8212; basic questions like: Did Hunter Biden drop that laptop off at that repair shop? Are the emails authentic? Do you deny that they are? Do you claim any have been altered or any of them fabricated? Did you in fact meet with Burisma executives as these emails suggest? . . . The reason that they don&#8217;t answer any questions is because the media has signaled that they don&#8217;t have to. That journalists will be attacked and vilified simply for asking.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

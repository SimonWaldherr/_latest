Similarly, Impossible's goal would be to design a milk alternative for people who prefer the real stuff to any of the currently available alternatives.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Laura Kliman, senior flavor scientist at Impossible, demonstrated two of the prototype's functional qualities from Impossible's lab in Redwood City, California. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">First she poured the milk into a hot cup of coffee to show how easily it mixed into the beverage. Plant-based milk alternatives usually don't blend easily with coffee, and can make it cloudy or gritty. She also showed that the beverage can heat up and foam like dairy milk. </p><p id="cnn-end-of-content" class="myFinance-widget"></p><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="Plant-based milk doesn&amp;#39;t mix well with coffee, as seen on the left.

It's possible that what Kliman demonstrated could be the final recipe, or that anything which eventually makes it to shelves could be completely different. </p><a></a><p>"We have made prototypes from a number of different plant sources," Brown said, adding that soy, which was an ingredient in the prototype, is "a very good choice from a nutritional standpoint and a supply chain standpoint, and for those reasons I think there's a decent chance that it will be the base protein for our product." Impossible uses soy to make its plant-based ground meat products, as well as the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/06/business/impossible-foods-pork-ces/index.html" target="_blank">pork product it announced early this year</a> </p></div>

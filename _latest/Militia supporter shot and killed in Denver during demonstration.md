A person reported to be a supporter of the Patriot Muster militia has been shot and killed at a protest in Denver, allegedly by a counterprotester with the BLM-Antifa rally.

The militia supporter maced a counterprotester, who then pulled out his handgun and shot dead the militia supporter, the Denver Post reported.

Rival rallies had been called for Saturday afternoon by the two opposing groups.

John 'Tig' Tiegen summoned his 'Patriot Muster' followers to a 2pm gathering in the Civic Center park with the slogan: 'Stand up, show up.'

'Join myself and hundreds of fellow Patriot Americans for a Muster at Civic Center Park 2pm sharp,' he wrote on Instagram.

'Don't let the communists, socialist party and groups intimidate or Oppress you any longer! Come join us and be heard & seen and celebrate OUR freedoms.'

BLM-Antifa organized their own rally in the same spot, at 1:30pm - telling their supporters: 'Counter protest the fascist rally nearby!'

Two men have been arrested - one is seen with the handgun by his right arm

Tiegen promoted the Patriot Muster gathering with the words: 'Stand up. Show up'

A huge police presence in the center of the Colorado city meant that, on hearing the gunshot, riot police were almost immediately on the scene.

They arrested the gunman, who dropped his handgun without resistance and was arrested.

'Officers are investigating a shooting that occurred in the Courtyard by the Art Museum,' Denver Police Department (DPD) tweeted.

'This shooting is now being investigated as a Homicide,' they confirmed.

They said two people were in custody.

Denver has seen a series of tense protests and counter protests this summer.

On Saturday, as with previous weekend, the right-leaning protesters were inside the amphitheater area while the left-leaning protestors were outside.

Large numbers of officers attempted to keep the two sides apart.

Police were not letting anyone else into amphitheater area, but by 3:30pm, the Denver Post reported, the barrier appeared to be coming down.

Police fired what appeared to be pepper balls into the crowd, after people from the leftist group started rattling the barrier headed into the amphitheater.

Tiegen, the Patriot Muster organizer, said the BLM-Antifa protesters started throwing soup cans at the police.

Police expected there to be trouble. In previous weeks they have asked organizers to cancel or postpone their rallies, to try and tone down tension.

Ahead of Saturday's rallies, they issued a statement saying the department 'respects the right to peacefully assemble.'

They continued: 'Those who participate in protests, demonstrations, marches, or other gatherings, as protected by the First Amendment, are reminded to do so in a lawful manner.

'Individuals who choose to act outside of local, state and federal law, will be subject to citation or arrest.'

Tiegen, the Patriot Muster organizer, is the author of the book 13 Hours, detailing the botched Benghazi raid, which was turned into a film.

John Tiegen, organizer of the 'Patriot Muster' group

Tiegen spent four years in the Marines and then several years as a security contractor with Blackwater Security on missions in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, he says on his website.

Tiegen then worked for the CIA on their Global Response Staff, deployed to 40 countries around the world.

He was in Libya in September 2011 when the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi was attacked, and four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, killed.

He received the Award for Heroism and Valor for his bravery that night.

Back in his native Colorado, Tiegen has carved out a career for himself as a motivational speaker.

He is also the leader of Patriot Muster, and regularly appears on television and radio to discuss his group's activities.

On Saturday he said his Facebook page had been taken down.

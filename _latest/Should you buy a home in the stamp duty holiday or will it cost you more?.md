This sizeable jump means asking prices have risen at 5 per cent annually, the highest annual rate for over four years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rightmove warned asking prices could peak soon, with an annual growth rate of 7 per cent in December this year, before starting to drop off at the turn of the new year.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">ONS figures based on Land Registry sold prices data show the average house price up &#163;8,900 since the start of lockdown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet a growing body of property insiders and analysts think the housing sector's 'mini-boom' will start dropping off once the Chancellor's stamp duty holiday comes to an end on 31 March.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The restricted availability of mortgage deals, rising unemployment and mounting economic turmoil, they argue, means the optimism and buoyancy seen in the market now stands on a knife edge.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could mean buying a home when prices are artificially inflated by a surging market could cost you more - even if you save on stamp duty.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You could also be left with a bigger mortgage than your home is worth if house prices were to fall significantly.</p><h3>Stamp Duty Calculator</h3> <p class="calc-desc">How much tax would you have to pay on a home or buy-to-let?</p>  <ul class="calc-inputs"> <li> Purchase price <p class="calc-pound">&#163;  </p> </li> <li> Is this a buy-to-let or second home?

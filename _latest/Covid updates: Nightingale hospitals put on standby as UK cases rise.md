The scientific advisers were asked how confident they are that transmission is happening in the community and not other settings, such as schools.

Prof Steve Powis says he is "very confident" that infection rates are increasing in the community.

"The data is clear and of course the difference from the first wave in April is that we have that data," he says.

He says it's "obviously important" that infection is also controlled in hospitals - but stresses: "This is a problem of community infection rates increasing."

On the infection rate in schools, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says: "Actually if you salami slice the infection data very carefully across the school age bands, what you actually see is very low rates of increase in infection up to the age of 16."

He says the infection rate then picks up a bit in the 17 and 18 age bracket.

"We already know children are not drivers of spread in the community" as they are for the flu virus, Prof Van-Tam adds.

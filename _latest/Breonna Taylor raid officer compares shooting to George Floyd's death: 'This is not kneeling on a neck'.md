This is nothing like that," Mattingly said, referring to the death of Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis in May after a police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"What happened to him was tragic," Mattingly said. "It was horrible. Everybody looked at that said, 'wrong, bad, disgusting.'"</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Mattingly then noted that the four officers in the Floyd incident were arrested and taken into custody afterward.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"In my opinion that was the right call, whether he died of an overdose or whatever," Mattingly said, referring to Floyd.</p><p></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">He continued, "In my opinion, George Floyd was not a model citizen."</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"Good Morning America" co-host Michael Strahan responded, "It's very hard for me to sit here and hear that George Floyd died of an overdose. He died because somebody was kneeling on his neck for minutes."</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"I agree with that," Mattingly said."In regards to him being a model citizen or not, he didn't deserve that.

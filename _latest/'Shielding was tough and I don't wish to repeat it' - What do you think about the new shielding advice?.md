Health officials admitted this week that the shielding policy during the first lockdown, that included a blanket instruction to stay home, caused "harm" and "left people feeling imprisoned".

Now, during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, those who are considered "clinically extremely vulnerable" will instead be told to take practical steps to reduce exposure to the virus which will be linked to the risk levels in their area.

We asked Telegraph readers who shielded during the first coronavirus lockdown how they felt about the new advice. Readers shared their experiences and told us whether they thought the new advice was clear given the added element of the new three-tier lockdown.

Were you told to shield during the first lockdown? Share your experience in the comments section below.

'Second time round we won't have the pleasure of it being summer'

@Joe Gywnne:

“I was shielded the first time round and we are lucky that we have a nice big garden and it was summer. Second time round we won't have that pleasure.

“The first shielding policy was harsh, for instance, 'if you need fresh air open a window', was the jist of one of the points.

“But at that point no one really knew what we were dealing with and now six to eight months later we have a better idea

“However, part of me thinks that the government can't afford to 'shield' the same people a second time around because of the impact on the already battered economy.”

'I know what to do regardless of which tier I am in'

@Vyv James:

“I wasn’t required to self isolate during the first lockdown but age put me in the vulnerable category and in essence I went into a voluntary isolation.

“Since then I was diagnosed with cancer and I have had treatment including surgery and I am about to undergo chemotherapy, but I know what to do regardless of which tier I am in.”

'Common sense is the common denominator'

@Terry Bates:

“Being 74 and asthmatic I shield myself and take all the prescribed precautions relating to social distancing and hand washing but use my common sense as to where and when I go out and who I meet and where.

“Common sense is the prevalent common denominator whatever age group or whatever you do. Partying in great numbers or demonstrating with no social distancing shows a total lack of not only common sense but a lack of respect or care about other people you may pass the virus on to.

“Whatever they do or don’t do, the scapegoat is always the Government – any government anywhere. Guidelines are there for all, common sense is the common denominator.”

'Shielding the first time was a tough experience I don't wish to repeat it'

@Evan Johnson:

“I'm 39 and shielded due to having no spleen. It was a tough experience I don't wish to repeat. Now armed with greater knowledge and processes in place to reduce the risk I see no reason for me to shield again, just be very careful.

“The risks of other conditions will be different to mine so doctors need to be involved in deciding who needs greater protection, it's not one size fits all. This time if people are asked to shield they should automatically be paid their full wage if in work and their employers should be compensated.”

'I didn't feel that I was under house arrest'

@Peter Kitto:

“At the time, during the first lockdown, the system seemed the right thing to do, but I don’t think it would be right to do it again.

“I didn’t feel that I was under ‘house arrest’ as someone said.

“I am lucky that I can go out on countryside walks without seeing many people very locally which I did most days.”

'My greatest deprivation is a lack of face to face social contact'

@Stanley McRae

“I am 89 years old and have prostate cancer kept under control by monthly hormone therapy.

“Since the first lockdown I have averaged 5000 steps of moderate walking every day, mostly alone. I feel fitter now than when the lockdown first started.

“I live alone in a bubble with my daughter and am reasonably happy despite the restrictions. I am using common sense to try to avoid mixing with other people by only using public transport when absolutely necessary (I don’t drive) and keeping distance, washing hands and not having many meals out.

“My greatest deprivation is the lack of face-to-face social contact and not being able to meet my extended family, friends and neighbours.

“I’m resolved to ‘keep on carrying on’.”

'It's better than the first time around'

@cheryl parr

“It’s better than the first time around, but my mother watches the news and is terrified to go out now. She has been inside since March 8. She is totally miserable and can’t see or even speak to her elusive doctor.

“She has had no eye appointments. She is going blind and needs injections to slow it down. We rang in September, as there have been no appointments since July, for eye injection appointments being sent out in October. It is now the middle of October and we have heard nothing.

“So yes it is far better than the last time, but my mother still refuses to go out and her next door neighbour is the same.”

'I'll continue to take precautions until there's a vaccine'

@S B Mason

“I don't need, and did not need the Government, nor any 'expert', nor my GP to tell me what to do in the face of an (as yet) incurable and killer global pandemic.

“I had already started to shield myself even before the Government's advice way back in March – I was at least three weeks ahead of them! I was wearing a mask even while we were being told they were useless. I will continue to take all sensible precautions for myself until such time there is a reliable and useful vaccination – however long that may take. None of us can rely on others to do 'the right thing', so the only sensible way is to ensure we do all we can to protect ourselves.

“The difficulty at the beginning was trying to get online shopping, but that is all now sorted and I very much doubt I will visit a supermarket in person ever again (or until there is a vaccination).

"The greatest challenge was not seeing nor holding my newborn grandchild, and the greatest heartbreak continues to be not being able to hold and hug my family. However, for the want of a hug a life could be lost.”

'There are always going to be more questions than answers'

@Keith Hambly-Staite

“Clarity and consistency in advice is paramount. My mother-in-law is in a care home aged 92. It was her birthday last week; we were initially told no flowers would be allowed in her room as they were considered a Covid risk!

“The vulnerable and those who shielded are now being told to take extreme care but if there are children at school in the household they can still go to school. Surely that is the Achilles heel, and there are many more. There are always going to be more questions than answers.”

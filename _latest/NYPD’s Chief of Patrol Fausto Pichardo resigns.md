NYPD Chief of Patrol Fausto Pichardo abruptly resigned from his post Tuesday because of friction with Mayor de Blasio, according to police and sources.

The high-ranking cop apparently hit his breaking point last week when he worked long hours covering protests against lockdown measures put in place by the state in Borough Park, a law enforcement source said.

When he got home from the shifts, the mayor had called him with questions about a minor house party in the city that the source said could have been handled at the precinct level.

“He just had enough,” the source said.

Pichardo was appointed by Police Commissioner Dermot Shea in December and oversaw the department’s “largest and most visible bureau,” according to the NYPD.

In the role, he oversaw a majority of the force’s nearly 24,000 uniformed police officers, who are assigned to each of the department’s 77 precincts citywide.

He’ll leave the post sometime in the next 30 days, authorities said, but it’s unclear when his last day in the department will be.

Pichardo began his career in 1997, serving as a police cadet before graduating to a police officer in the Midtown North Precinct two years later.

He went on to serve in a number of high-profile posts in the department, including as commanding officer of the 33rd Precinct in Washington Heights and commanding officer of the 43rd Precinct in the Soundview section of the Bronx.

Before being tapped for the Chief of Patrol job, he served as the Executive Officer in the Patrol Services Bureau under Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison.

Pichardo resigned over friction with City Hall, a source said.

“Chief Fausto Pichardo, the NYPD Chief of Patrol, filed for retirement on Tuesday, ending an accomplished more than two-decade long career in the New York City Police Department,” the department said in a statement.

“Chief Pichardo, 43, was the first Chief of Patrol of Dominican heritage in NYPD history and has worked tirelessly in recent months to guide the men and women in uniform through a series of challenging issues that have strained the city and the agency.”

Basking in the glory of his fourth NBA championship late Sunday, Finals MVP LeBron James FaceTimed his mother, Gloria, reflecting on how she's inspired him.

"I had to leave the locker room; they're going crazy in there right now. I had to get away. I'm calling you, I love you," James said as captured by several NBA reporters on social media. "You are the reason why I'm able to even do this, Mom. You don't understand. Sixteen years old you bring a little (expletive) boy into the world."

James was sprawled out on the floor outside the Lakers' locker room, smoking a victory cigar in one hand with his phone in the other. James and his Laker teammates have been away from home for 10-plus weeks while in the NBA's bubble setup at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

"Come on, Mom," James said. "Everything that you had been through, everything that I had seen, there’s nothing that can stop me. This (expletive) is nothing compared to (expletive) you had to go through."

Gloria James is heard responding to her son, "God is good."

"God is good. God is great. I hope I continue to make you proud, Mom," LeBron James said. "I am nothing, I'm (expletive) without you. You're special. I love you so much."

Gloria James raised LeBron as a single mother at age 16. James has often credited his mother for his success over the years, thanking her in his four regular-season MVP award acceptance speeches. Earlier this season, James shared a heartfelt exchange with his mother in which she congratulated him for recording a triple-double against every NBA team.

James won his fourth Finals MVP after the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in Game 6 on Sunday. James finished with his 11th triple-double in an NBA Finals game – a stat line of 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists. In a Game 5 loss, he had 40 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.

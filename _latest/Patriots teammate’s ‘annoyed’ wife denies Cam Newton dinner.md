Dinner for two is off the table.

The reported dinner between Patriots teammates Cam Newton and Stephon Gilmore – which surfaced after Gilmore tested positive for COVID-19 following Newton’s diagnosis – never happened, according to Gilmore’s wife.

“There was no dinner out,” Gilmore’s wife, Gabrielle, wrote on Twitter. “I’m going to help you out so you guys stop reporting false news.”

She later added, “I’ve seen it circulating a couple times and now I’m annoyed lol,” and “I need my own show if you’re allowed to do these terrible takes and still have listeners.”

ESPN first reported that Newton and Gilmore had dinner together.

Newton tested positive for the virus before an Oct. 5 game at the Chiefs and did not play.

Gilmore traveled with the team and played in the game before his positive test was revealed Oct. 7.

Gilmore’s wife previously tweeted that her husband had four negative tests prior to facing the Chiefs.

The Patriots-Broncos game originally scheduled for last weekend was moved to next weekend. The Patriots closed their facility and practiced just once last week to try to limit the possibility of a team-wide outbreak, like the one that impacted the Titans.

Patriots defensive linemen Bill Murray and Byron Coward also wound up on the COVID-19 list but were not reported to be at the alleged dinner.

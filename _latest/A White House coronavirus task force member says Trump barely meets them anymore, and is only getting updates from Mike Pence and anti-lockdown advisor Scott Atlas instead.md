  A White House coronavirus task force member says Trump barely meets them anymore, and is only getting updates from Mike Pence and anti-lockdown advisor Scott Atlas instead 
description: > 
  A member of the White House coronavirus task force has told NPR that President Donald Trump has not attended a meeting "for quite some time."Dr. Francis Collins said that Trump mainly gets his updates from Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Scott Atlas, the task force member who has advised against lockdowns.Collins said Pence is "incredibly engaged" in task force meetings but that the president appears to be prioritizing campaigning for his reelection.Collins added that Pence, who leads the coronavirus task force, presides over its meetings and is "incredibly engaged."Atlas' specialisms are in health policy and neuroradiology, while other task force members have expertise in infectious diseases and public health.

Neither Pence nor Atlas are infectious-disease experts.</p><p>"I think the president primarily is getting his information from the vice president, from Dr. Atlas, obviously it's a bit of a chaotic time with the election," said Collins.</p><p>"So, yeah, there's not a direct connection between the task force members and the president as there was a few months ago. But this seems to be a different time with different priorities."</p><p>

</p><p>Collins did not say how long it had been since Trump had attended a task force meeting, but told NPR: "The task force continues to meet regularly at least once a week and to wrestle with a whole lot of the issues, especially now that we see the worsening of the pandemic in the middle of the country, which is really quite a serious concern."</p>

</p><p>Like the president, Atlas is against lockdowns and has issued <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tweet-removed-dr-scott-atlas-masks-dont-prevent-covid-19-2020-10">mixed messages</a> on mask wearing. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-scott-atlas-herd-immunity/2020/08/30/925e68fe-e93b-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html">According to The Washington Post</a>, he has also pushed for a "herd immunity" strategy, though he has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-adviser-is-pushing-white-house-to-adopt-herd-immunity-2020-8">vehemently denied</a> it.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious-disease expert, and CDC Director Robert Redfield have also questioned Atlas' scientific advice.

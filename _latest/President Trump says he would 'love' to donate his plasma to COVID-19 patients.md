President Trump told Fox News on Friday that he is "medication-free" and that he would donate plasma to help other coronavirus patients if asked.

"If that's if they want me to do it, I'd love to do it," Trump told Fox News medical expert, Dr. Marc Siegel when asked if he would donate plasma to those who need it.

In the interview, Trump also said he had been retested for the virus on Friday, but said he didn't know what the result was yet.

Requirements for donating plasma are strict and donors must have a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis and be symptom-free for at least two weeks.

President Trump told Fox News that his treatment for COVID-19 has ended that he would donate plasma to help other patients if asked.

In his first on-camera interview since being diagnosed with the coronavirus, Trump told Fox News medical expert, Dr. Marc Siegel, that he is currently medication free. Siegel has mostly praised the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic.

"Right now, I am medication free," Trump said, according to Fox News. "I'm not taking any medications as of probably eight hours ago. I'm medication free which, frankly, makes me feel good. I don't like medication."

When asked if he would donate plasma, the president responded: "I will. Nobody's asked me that question, actually, but I will. If that's if they want me to do it, I'd love to do it," Fox News reported.

Giving a glimpse into his experience of having the virus has been like, the president also told Siegel that he had some "congestion" in his lungs when he was treated at Walter Reed Medical Center.

"They tested the lungs ... with different machinery ... and it tested good," Trump said. "Initially, I think they had some congestion in there, but ultimately it tested good, and with each day it got better, and I think that's why they wanted me to stay frankly."

Trump also told Siegel he had been retested for the virus on Friday but said he didn't know the result.

"I haven't even found out the numbers or anything yet, but I've been retested and I know I'm at either at the bottom of the scale or free," Trump said, according to Newsweek.

The president has been eager to get back on the campaign trail and is already planning to hold an outdoor event at the White House on Saturday with hundreds of people in attendance despite not releasing a negative test for COVID-19.

He is also traveling to a rally in Florida on Monday.

Convalescent plasma has been widely used in the country after the FDA approved the treatment for emergency use in August. However, researchers are still gathering evidence to show how it works definitively.

Patsy was born to Diana McArthur, far left, when she was 16 years old. &quot;We grew up together,&quot; Diana said. During Patsy's years of drug abuse, Diana said she couldn't imagine it ever ending. But just over two years ago, it did. Patsy found recovery when she was locked up in the Chesterfield County Jail. As she lay on the jail floor in the throws of heroin withdrawal, Sheriff Karl Leonard told her to get up - she was going to be the first female participant of HARP (Heroin Addiction Recovery Program), an in-jail, Narcotics Anonymous-styled recovery group. &quot;The Sheriff saw in me what I couldn't see in myself,&quot; Patsy said." class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>Steve Miller, who became chairman of the company's board in 2018, <a href="https://www.purduepharma.com/news/2020/10/21/purdue-pharma-reaches-agreement-with-u-s-department-of-justice/" target="_blank">said in a press release</a> that the company "deeply regrets and accepts responsibility for the misconduct detailed by the Department of Justice." </p><p>The company filed for bankruptcy last year as it wades through thousands of civil lawsuits.

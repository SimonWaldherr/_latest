He has been keeping busy filming scenes for the latest instalment in the high-octane and iconic film franchise.

And Tom Cruise proved there's no rest for the wicked as he took part in a car chase scene with Hayley Atwell on the set of Mission Impossible 7 in Rome on Saturday.

The actor, 58, and Cinderella's Hayley, 38, proved to be the best of co-stars as they rounded off the day with a high-five.

Filming for the upcoming action movie was halted in Italy earlier this year after cases of coronavirus rose sharply.

The crew and actors have been in Norway filming ever since, before returning to the Italian capital earlier this week to continue with scenes.

Earlier this summer it was reported that the media personality hired a Â£500,000 ship for the film's crew in Norway to avoid any coronavirus-related delays.

Filming was already delayed for five months after COVID-19 spread across Italy, where production had been based in March, leading the release date to be pushed back to November 2021.

'They are terrified of further delays. Tom is determined not to see any more hold-ups. The studio believes it will keep everyone safe and get this shoot wrapped up', a source told The Sun earlier this summer.

It was recently claimed that Tom was 'exempt from Norway's quarantine rules' as he restarted filming in the Scandinavian country.

The media personality revealed how 'excited' he was to start shooting the latest instalment of the franchise in a phone call with Norway's Minister of Culture Abid Raja.

Mission Impossible 7 will be released on November 19, 2021.

<div><p>COVID-19 is killing Asian Americans in the Bay Area. In this six-part series, USA TODAY investigates how systemic racism is driving high death rates.</p><p class="dropcap">SAN FRANCISCO &#8211;&#160;Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the young girl was hours into a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/10/coronavirus-symptoms-diarrhea-nausea-congestion-runny-nose/5412946002/" target="_blank">fierce fever and a racking cough</a>. She was weak and didn&#8217;t want to eat. What few medications were on hand had expired. She sipped warm water instead.</p><p>&#8220;Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?&#8221; asked Amy Rong.</p><p>The mother and daughter, along with Rong&#8217;s parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways are cramped, bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/10/12/coronavirus-deaths-reveal-systemic-racism-united-states/5770952002/" target="_blank">spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus</a>.&#160;</p><p class="oembed-frame">
</p><p>That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy&#8217;s forehead, wondering if her child would die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the lone sofabed. The grandparents were eager for updates on Amy&#8217;s fever, but they worried their whispers would wake her.&#160;</p><p>In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless night. Rong made soup, but Amy wouldn&#8217;t eat it. She cooked porridge and spoon-fed it to her daughter.&#160;</p><p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/08/09/covid-testing-crunch-highlights-inequities-who-get-results-when/5558899002/" target="_blank">Getting tested for COVID-19</a> didn&#8217;t seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were expensive. Rong also feared the reaction from neighbors.</p><p>&#8220;If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,&#8221; said Rong. &#8220;Everyone would think you are the devil.&#8221;</p><p>It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts a bustling Chinatown as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians and Filipinos also have made their homes here, representing more than 20 different countries.&#160;</p><p>But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 123 COVID-19 deaths&#160;reported by the San Francisco Department of Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.</p><p class="ad-container tealplayer-ad-container"></p><p class="video-details title show-length">COVID-19 has taken a toll on Asian American communities in San Francisco</p><p class="video-details caption">Lack of government support and information has caused COVID-19 cases to rise in Asian American communities in San Francisco.</p><p class="video-details attribution">Harrison Hill, USA TODAY</p><p>Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher than the 12% reported,&#160;a by-product of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing, employment and health.&#160;</p><p>San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a time when officials don&#8217;t know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation&#8217;s 7.8 million coronavirus cases.&#160;Around 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.</p><p>In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language about testing, safety tips, housing and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line employment and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/13/USAT/ff57a5f1-fdc6-4c1a-a77b-6cf8c389a044-XXX_SELECTSS_5.JPG?width=7" alt="Various flags hang in San Francisco's Chinatown on Sept. 28, 2020.

      </p><p>For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the corrosive and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California at San Francisco professor of medicine.</p><p>Nguyen co-authored a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to the fact that 50% of San Francisco&#8217;s 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans, disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.</p><p>Although that percentage has since dropped, Nguyen said a lack of detailed data about Asian Americans often means that city funds aren&#8217;t allocated to this group.&#160;&#160;</p><p>&#8220;The truth is we are the ones who lose out as a result of this stereotype,&#8221; he added.</p><p>To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The median annual income of households headed by the nation&#8217;s 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060, compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.</p><p class="oembed-frame">
</p><p>But these success stories obscure the troubling reality facing many Asian Americans.</p><p>&#8220;You simply cannot look at Asian Americans as a monolithic group&#160;because if you do that, you&#8217;re going to miss how different communities experience the pandemic,&#8221; said Jarvis Chen, a lecturer in social and behavioral sciences at Harvard University&#8217;s T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Massachusetts.</p><p>A closer look at San Francisco's two&#160;dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. Census data. About a third of San Franciscans are foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;With Asian Americans, the average always is pulled way up by those doing very well, which means you miss the groups who clearly are not,&#8221; said Margaret Simms, a non-resident fellow with The Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., who specializes in race and labor economics. The think tank found nearly 13% of Asian American senior citizens live in poverty compared to a 9% national average.</p>

      </p><p>Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March. The attacks have ranged from verbal assaults to acts of physical violence.</p><p>When Asian Americans hear President Donald Trump, who contracted COVID-19 in October, repeatedly call the virus the &#8220;China virus&#8221; and &#8220;Kung Flu,&#8221; &#8220;it makes them less likely to seek help, a bit like early in the AIDS epidemic when the gay community was stigmatized,&#8221; said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy at the University of California at Riverside and chair of the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander American Affairs. &#8220;We fear many Asian American families have gone underground.&#8221;</p><p class="custom-chapter-marker no-image" id="decades-of-racist"><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">Decades of racist policies have limited Asian American&#8217;s standard of living</h2></p><p>Chinese citizens began passing through San Francisco&#8217;s then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the Gold Rush of 1849. By 1851, some 25,000 had arrived, lured by the hope of riches in a land called Gum Saan in Cantonese, or &#8220;gold mountain.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from entering the country, with few exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush&#8217;s boom and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.</p><p>At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to internment camps, feared as the traitorous &#8220;yellow peril&#8221; after years of citizenship. Despite painful and humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to engrain themselves in the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans. Japanese Americans were among the most decorated U.S. soldiers during the war, and others excelled in academics and commerce.</p><p class="oembed-frame">
</p><p>The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian American success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other nations, namely the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups, notably Black Americans.</p><p>The logic went that if Asian Americans were doing so well, surely failure on the part of other ethnic groups was their own fault.</p><p>Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees followed by countless others who escaped Southeast Asia in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.</p><p>&#8220;The stereotype about us is broad&#160;and includes the notion that we&#8217;re all studious, we don&#8217;t get into trouble and commit crimes, and even the poor don&#8217;t have health care issues,&#8221; said Ellen Wu, author of &#8220;The Color of Success: Asian Americans and the Origins of the Model Minority&#8221; and history professor at Indiana University in Bloomington. &#8220;That&#8217;s quite the change from before World War II&#160;when many of us were seen as unclean and prone to diseases.&#8221;</p><p>California Assemblymember David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and chairs the California Asian &amp; Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.&#160;&#160;</p>

      </p><p>&#8220;The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important, but our issue hasn&#8217;t gotten the attention it deserves,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p><p>One small demographic victory for Asian Americans came in 1997 when President Bill Clinton directed the Office of Management and Budget to expand its data classification system to break out &#8220;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders&#8221; from the Asian American group. That geographic list includes countries such as Micronesia, Tonga, Vanuatu, Guam, the Marshall Islands and Fiji.</p><p>As a result, we know today that Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of COVID-19 deaths, behind Native Americans and Black Americans.&#160;</p><p>But many other Asians said they are largely neglected by government officials.</p><p>What disappoints Marc Belocura most, he said, is that he feels ignored despite living in a part of town that city officials once highlighted as a bastion of Filipino culture.</p><p>"Since the city obviously knows we are here, why is there not more outreach that is culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate?" said Belocura, 23. "Or maybe we just are not on their radar."</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/15/USAT/d8f904fe-23cf-41e3-8d9f-cd6e3b57081c-XXX_Scene9.JPG?width=7" alt="People walk and shop at the produce market in Chinatown in downtown San Francisco on Sept. 29, 2020."><p class="image-zoom__modal-trigger"></p><p class="in-depth-image-caption-container">People walk and shop at the produce market in Chinatown in downtown San Francisco on Sept. 29, 2020.<p class="in-depth-image-credit">Harrison Hill, USA TODAY</p></p><p>Belocura girds himself each time he prepares to leave the one-room studio he shares with his parents and sister to shop for food and supplies.</p><p>Even before COVID-19, his aging neighborhood just south of Market Street was crumbling. Now more storefronts have shuttered. To avoid the homeless camps that have mushroomed across the area, Belocura walks in the street and hopes he doesn&#8217;t get hit by a car.</p><p>When he makes it home, he must then navigate a narrow stairwell to get into his one-room apartment on the second floor of a five-story building.&#160;</p><p>Belocura's parents, who are 71 and 60, share the lone bed. His sister, 35, and he put pillows on the floor each night. Transmission in the studio&#8217;s confines would likely be immediate.</p><p>"That's why I just can't get COVID when I go out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p class="custom-chapter-marker no-image" id="covid19-informationhard-to"><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">COVID-19 information&#160;hard to find in other languages</h2></p><p>Asian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese and Hindi.

The city's various <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Alternative-Housing/4nah-suat/" target="_blank">isolation and quarantine sites for the homeless and partially housed</a> also are being used largely by the city's Latino population,&#160;with Hispanics&#160;making up 45% of those in shelters while Asians account&#160;for 7%.</p><p>Asian activists and health care workers trying to fill the void said they face a population that often is wary of Western medicine, fatalistic about getting the virus, culturally averse to passing along bad news to elders and nervous about losing employment.</p><p>Natalie Ah Soon, health planner with the <a href="https://www.apiahf.org/" target="_blank">Asian Pacific Islander Health Parity Coalition</a> advocacy group, said some people have told her, &#8220;If God means for me to be COVID-19 positive, then OK.&#8221;</p><p>Kent Woo, executive director of the <a href="http://www.nicoschc.org/" target="_blank">NICOS Chinese Health Coalition</a>, said residents sometimes are suspicious of health care workers when they visit local low-income buildings to talk about coronavirus safety tips.&#160;</p><p>"Folks say, 'What's the point of being tested?' or 'We don't know where to go if we get infected,'" he said. "When we offer the option to anyone who tests positive to leave the premises and go to a hotel, they refuse."</p><p>Teams have started to be more proactive, he said, heading to single-room occupancy residences and other housing complexes before there is any rumor of a positive test. The goal is to prepare residents so they know how to respond if someone falls sick.&#160;</p><p>The need is dire. Amy Dai, project coordinator for the <a href="https://www.chinatowncdc.org/" target="_blank">Chinatown Community Development Center</a>, an advocacy group that also manages low-income properties, learned that in a building she manages, 10 residents out of 30 families had tested positive.</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/15/USAT/cc4aefe3-f8df-4820-88a4-b57806426261-GettyImages-1216314133.jpg?width=7" alt="A deserted Grant Street in Chinatown on April 1, 2020, in San Francisco."><p class="image-zoom__modal-trigger"></p><p class="in-depth-image-caption-container">A deserted Grant Street in Chinatown on April 1, 2020, in San Francisco.<p class="in-depth-image-credit">Justin Sullivan, Getty Images</p></p><p>When she approached two of the residents who had come down with a fever, they assured her they couldn&#8217;t be positive because they had not left the building.

She used to go out to shop and visit a local Buddhist temple to give alms. But now her children shop for her and the temple is closed. Sometimes she checks in on friends through Facebook. She watches television, but her limited knowledge of English renders programs a pantomime.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m careful,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All I know is the virus is easy to get.&#8221;</p><p class="custom-chapter-marker no-image" id="no-end-in"><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">No end in sight</h2></p><p>Rong never found out whether her daughter had COVID-19. But her days remain filled with dread.</p><p>For the past few months, the family has had little money for food or rent, which is $750 a month. Sometimes, neighbors give them something to eat; other times she goes to the local food bank.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;We eat&#160;lots of potatoes,&#8221; she said.</p><p>It&#8217;s a far cry from the life she envisioned for herself. In Guangdong Province, Rong had a promising job as a clothing store clerk. At the urging of her former husband&#8217;s parents, she emigrated 12 years ago to California, where she found work as a janitor to keep the family afloat.

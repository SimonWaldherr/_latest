  Prince William laments the 'unimaginable challenges' faced by cancer patients 
description: > 
  Prince William spoke yesterday of the 'unimaginable challenges' faced by cancer patients as a result of the virus.This included the creation of a Covid-free cancer hub which ensured patients were able to continue with their urgent surgery.He said: 'I am delighted to lay the foundation stone of the Oak Centre, 30 years after my mother did the same.'But before the official ground-breaking moment, I want to acknowledge the unimaginable challenges that all those at the Marsden have faced this year.Frontline workers told him about the Surgical Cancer Hub The Royal Marsden and its cancer alliance formed at the start of the pandemic to provide cancer surgery to patients around the country.

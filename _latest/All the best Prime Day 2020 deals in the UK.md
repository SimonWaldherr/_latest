Deal of the day: Get £10 extra credit when you top up your gift card balance with £100 or more this Prime Day.

We've had to wait a long time for Prime Day, but it's finally here, and we're expecting impressive deals on all the biggest brands. This year's shopping event begins on Oct. 13 and will run for a full 48 hours. That should give you plenty of time to find discounts on everything you need.

There are going to be a lot of deals to consider, so your only real problem is going to be finding the best deals from the crowd. Wouldn't it be nice if you could somehow get the highlights, rather than trawling through page after page of offers? Well, that's exactly what we're delivering.

We have done all the hard work for you and tracked down deals on absolutely everything, including TVs, laptops, and gaming products. This page will act as a central hub for Prime Day 2020, and will include a handpicked selection of the very best deals from the sale. We recommend bookmarking this page, as we will keep you posted on the best offers as they drop.

We will keep posting a selection of standout deals on this page, but if you're looking for something specific, check out the following pages:

How to find the best deals on Prime Day

We know that these major shopping events can be totally overwhelming, but there are some steps you can take to make sure things go smoothly.

Firstly, you need to be prepared. Before Prime Day, you should make a plan and put a list together, and then wishlist those products and set deal alerts within the Amazon app. This way you'll be primed and ready for when prices drop. We also recommend familiarising yourself with how Amazon actually works, and how the site looks. This might seem obvious, but it can save you a lot of time and hassle when deals start appearing all over the place.

You should also be aware of all the different ways that Prime members can shop and find the best deals on Prime Day . We've rounded up some of the tips and tricks you should know about:

Amazon App: Prime members can shop with the Amazon App, meaning you'll never miss a Prime Day deal.

Treasure Truck: Customers can find hand-selected product offers at amazing prices. They can opt-in by texting ‘TRUCK’ to 65018 and will receive SMS notifications whenever there’s something new to share.

Amazon Hub: Customers have the option to pick up and return their Amazon packages through the Amazon Hub. This is a contactless, click and collect service. And it's free for Prime members.

Rewards for Prime members on Amazon Platinum and Classic Mastercards: From Oct. 1 to Oct. 25, if eligible Prime members apply and are approved for either the Amazon Platinum Mastercard or Amazon Classic Mastercard, a £30 Amazon Gift Card will automatically be added to their gift card balance.

The more you know, the better your chances are of walking away with the product you want at a heavily discounted price.

How to sign up for Amazon Prime

It goes without saying, but Prime Day is for Prime members. So if you want to get involved, you should probably sort out a membership.

If you're new to Amazon Prime, you can start off with a 30-day free trial . This is the best option if you have any sort of doubts about a proper membership. After the trial period, a membership will cost you £79 a year or £7.99 a month, depending on which subscription option you've picked. You can cancel if you decide a Prime membership is not for you, so long as you cancel within the 30-day time frame.

If you want the pay monthly plan, you just need to look out for the "TRY PRIME" buttons. Fortunately, these are just about everywhere on the site. If you want to pay annually, the best method of subscribing is finding the "SEE MORE PLANS" button, which is directly underneath the "TRY PRIME" button. They really aren't hard to spot, so you should be able to get up and running in no time.

There is also the option to give Prime as a gift. This is not the most romantic gift out there, but it could be seriously useful if you know the recipient is on the lookout for deals this Prime Day.

 <p>     </p> <p>She said: "I needed to sign some contract. It has the details about&#160;Covid-19. And it told me that it's very safe, even though it's only stage 3."</p> <p> "I'm a little worried about [it being] experimental stage 3," Ms Wu told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-student-returning-to-the-uk-has-unproven-50-covid-vaccine-12108858?awc=11005_1603228787_07ae9de223a6cb515a495f02bf15d7c9&amp;dcmp=afc-143466-na-na-longtail&amp;dclid=CJyOgNOMxOwCFXvFuwgd_DABwg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sky News</a>. </p> <p>"And I think I was the one who was the test subject, the one who was treated like a little mouse."</p> <p>But she added: "I trust China and I think it's totally safe to get vaccinated. I trust the government.</p> <p>"But some doctors and some teachers refused to take the vaccination. They think it's dangerous because they think they are being tested.</p>

   <p>"They don't want to be the volunteer to get the experimental vaccine."</p> <p>Ms Wu flew back to China at the request of her mother back in March.</p> <p>"She is happy for me to have the vaccination," she said.</p> <p>"Because she thinks I am brave. I make an example for others.</p>

   <p>"Because there is an old saying, the first one to eat the crabs is the most brave, right?"</p> <p>The UK could become the first nation to carry out human challenge studies, in which healthy people will be intentionally exposed to the virus responsible for Covid-19 in order to test the effectiveness of different vaccine candidates.</p> <p>The Government is putting &#163;33.6m towards the research, with trials set to begin in early January 2021.</p> <p>At present, there are more than 240 coronavirus vaccine candidates being tested around the world.</p>

   <p>It comes after the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance warned a vaccine won't be ready until spring next year.</p> <p> Sir Patrick added it is &#8220;unlikely&#8221; that a&#160; <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> &#160;vaccine will stop the disease completely. </p> <p>Giving evidence to the joint Commons and Lords National Security Strategy Committee, Sir Patrick said that only one disease &#8211; smallpox &#8211; had ever been completely eradicated.</p> <p>But Sir Patrick said they &#8220;may&#8221; be some doses before that, but it remains to be seen.</p>

   <p>He also warned that that in future, treating Covid-19 may become more like seasonal flu.</p> <p>&#8220;I think it is unlikely that we will end up with a truly sterilising vaccine that completely stops infection,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>&#8220;It is likely that this disease will circulate and be pandemic. My assessment &#8211; and I think that&#8217;s the view of many people &#8211; is that&#8217;s the likely outcome.</p> <p>&#8220;Clearly as management becomes better, as you get vaccination that will decrease the chance of infection and the severity of the disease &#8211; or whatever the protocols of the vaccines are &#8211; this then starts to look more like annual flu than anything else and that may be the direction we end up going."</p></div>

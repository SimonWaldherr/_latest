Megan said she knew in her gut that something was going to spark between them when she found out Colson had been cast in on of her movies.

'I could feel that some wild s**t was going to happen to me from that meeting, but I wasn't yet sure what,' she added. 'I just felt it like, deep in my soul - that something was going to come from that. So then, we met on set.'

The Transformers star even went so far as to say, she could see something akin to a soul mate in the rapper, or what she calls a 'twin flame.'

She explained: 'I knew right away that he was what I call a twin flame. Instead of a soul mate, a twin flame is actually where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time.'

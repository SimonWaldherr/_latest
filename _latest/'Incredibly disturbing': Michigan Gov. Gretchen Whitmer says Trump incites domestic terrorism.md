Gretchen Whitmer accused President Donald Trump of inciting domestic terrorism during a national TV appearance Sunday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It's incredibly disturbing that the president of the United States, 10 days after a plot to kidnap, put me on trial&#160;and execute me &#8230; is at it again &#8230; inciting this kind of domestic terrorism," Whitmer said on NBC's "Meet the Press" after a Trump campaign appearance in Michigan on Saturday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It is dangerous, not just for me and my family&#160;but for public servants everywhere," Whitmer said, calling on opinion leaders to "call this out" and demand Trump tamp down his remarks.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A Trump campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Saturday night, Trump held a campaign rally at an airport near Muskegon, where he repeated criticism of Whitmer over measures she has taken to address the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/17/trump-whitmer-lock-her-up-muskegon-rally/3699043001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">prompting crowd chants of "Lock her Up."</a> His summary of the alleged plot against Whitmer: "I guess they say she was threatened."</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Trump has said Whitmer should appreciate that federal officials uncovered and foiled the plot. In response to the chant from the crowd, he laughed and said, "Lock them all up."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The campaign of Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden slammed the episode.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"His conduct reflects his own insecurity and envy of Gov. Whitmer&#8217;s respected record of leadership in a time of crisis," spokesman Andrew Bates said. "It also serves as a reminder that our nation is at a crossroads."</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Federal and state officials <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/10/15/whitmer-plot-charges-nessel/3661482001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">charged 14 men in connection</a> with&#160;alleged domestic terror plots that included a plan to kidnap Whitmer from her family's vacation home in northern Michigan.

She said she uses the Michigan Public Health code and other powers to continue a statewide mask mandate, restrict the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings&#160;and set requirements to ensure workplace safety.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Trump told thousands gathered at his rally Saturday they need to get Whitmer to end Michigan's lockdown. She lifted a stay-at-home order June 1, though some restrictions on business and other activities remain.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We haven't had a stay-home order since late spring," Whitmer said Sunday, but Trump "never lets facts get in the way of comments he is making."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She said Trump's response to the pandemic is "the worst in the globe" because he has politicized the crisis, rather than addressing it from a science and health perspective.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We should have acted as if we are in a war," Whitmer said. "But not a war with one another."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It was Whitmer's third appearance on "Meet the Press," the longest-running program in TV history.&#160;She appeared on the program in March and April&#160;during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/politics/2020/10/08/michigan-gov-gretchen-whitmer-her-career-pictures/5519168002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

Face masks can almost halve the number of new coronavirus cases, a study has claimed.

Covering the face indoors resulted in up to 46 per cent fewer new Covid-19 cases every week in Canada, researchers from Simon Fraser University found.

If masks had been made compulsory in enclosed spaces in the country in early July, the number of new weekly cases could have been reduced by up to 40 per cent (1,100 fewer infections) in mid-August, they claim.

Mask mandates are associated with an average weekly reduction of 25 to 31 per cent in newly diagnosed Covid-19 cases in the first few weeks after they are introduced, the research also found.

Dr Julian Tang, a consultant virologist at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, said the study adds to a growing body of evidence that masks may be effective at slowing the spread of coronavirus.

He said previous laboratory and observational studies on the effectiveness of masks suggest that the reduction in cases could be even greater than this study reports.

"The authors use a modelling approach to tease out the protective effects of masking from other interventions and conclude that wearing a mask may reduce the risk of infection by about 30 per cent," he said.

"This is lower than the above estimated benefits obtained from laboratory studies, but is still a useful and significant benefit.”

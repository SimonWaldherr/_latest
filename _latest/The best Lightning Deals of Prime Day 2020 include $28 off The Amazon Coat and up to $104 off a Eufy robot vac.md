Amazon Prime Day's Lightning Deals are aptly named — they're available for a limited time and have limited stock. Once the timer ends or the deal is 100% claimed, you'll have to add yourself to the waitlist in case more items become available — we've seen it happen. For example, yesterday, we watched a Lightning Deal on a Coop Original Pillow sell out within 10 minutes of going live. But later in the day, they released more stock, and today the cooling version of the Coop Pillow, the Eden, went on sale.

That's why we're staying on top of the best Lightning Deals so you don't have to wade through 200 pages of deals to find that hidden gem. We'll be updating this article throughout Prime Day, so keep checking back. And don't be discouraged if you miss out on a Lightning Deal. A new one is coming up ... now.

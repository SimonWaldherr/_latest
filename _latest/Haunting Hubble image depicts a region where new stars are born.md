<div><p>The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope grabbed a beautiful, haunting image of a gaseous "stellar nursery" that the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2020/hubble-snaps-a-special-stellar-nursery/" target="_blank">space agencies published Friday</a>.</p>
<p>In this image we can see what's known as Free-floating Evaporating Gaseous Globule (frEGGs), dark and compact globules of dust and gas, surrounded by a bubble of hot, ionized gas wherein new stars can be formed. The purple-ish, blue-ish border around the dusty frEGGs is the boundary between the the cooler globules and the hotter gas bubble, according to the ESA.</p>

</p><p>Near the dust, a massive new star has begun the shine, <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve" target="_blank">formed</a> by spinning, coalescing gas clouds that build up mass and progressively grow hotter. This star's heat radiates outward into the surrounding gas, causing hydrogen atoms to shed electrons and form a superhot outer shell of ionic atoms and free electrons that continuously collide with each other.</p>

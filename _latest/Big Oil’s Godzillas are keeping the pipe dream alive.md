<div><p>As big western oil giants like BP and Shell agonise over how to reinvent themselves in the face of a warming climate, some of the world&#8217;s other top producers are taking a very different approach.</p>
<p>At BP&#8217;s headquarters in London, chief executive Bernard Looney is mapping out plans <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/12/bp-plans-big-cuts-carbon-emissions-net-zero-push/">to cut oil and gas production</a> over the coming decade.</p>
<p>Three thousand miles away in the sweltering Saudi oil capital of Dhahran, the boss of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s state-owned oil giant, is planning to ramp up production to meet demand when pandemic restrictions ease - and takes a far more relaxed view.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect oil demand growth to continue in the long term, driven by rising populations and economic growth,&#8221; the company said recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speculation about an imminent peak in oil demand is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/25/reports-oils-demise-have-greatly-exaggerated/">simply not consistent</a> with the realities of oil consumption.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar story in Moscow, where Russia&#8217;s state oil producer Rosneft has warned BP and Shell their failure to invest in new crude production risks creating an &#8220;existential crisis&#8221; for oil supplies that could force up prices.</p>
<p>For Big Oil, this is a big deal.</p>
<p>After all, Saudi Aramco and Rosneft are far bigger global producers which put together pump over 17m barrels of oil and gas per day, dwarfing the 7.7m daily barrels in combined global output of BP and Shell.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a question that goes to the heart of the problem the oil industry confronts in facing up to the climate threat. Western firms may be taking big steps to curb emissions from their own operations, and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/20/orsted-oil-giant-went-dirty-fuel-clean-energy-decade/">invest in renewable energy like wind and solar</a>.</p>
<p>But how much will it matter if the slack is simply taken up by industry rivals with a different agenda?</p>
<p>More than half of global oil and gas production and a larger share of global reserves are controlled by state-owned so-called National Oil Companies (NOCs) like Aramco, Venezuela&#8217;s PDVSA and Russia&#8217;s Rosneft, which is 19pc owned by BP and excluded from BP&#8217;s own climate goals.</p>

Joe Biden is the person referred to as the 'the big guy' who would receive 10 percent equity in a deal with a Chinese energy firm, as referenced in an email chain including his son Hunter, a report says.

According to Fox News, the May 13, 2017, email sent to Hunter by James Gilliar, from consulting firm J2cR, has been authenticated by others included on the chain.

The network also claimed that sources have confirmed Joe Biden was 'the big guy' listed among the six people who would receive the payments.

The payees were only identified with initials and nicknames with a note stating that 'the big guy' would get his payment through 'H'.

'H' is his son Hunter, sources told Fox, who would receive 20 percent.

The emails were sent when Biden was no longer Vice President and Trump was in office.

Sources has told Fox that 'the big guy' referenced in this email is Joe Biden

Hunter Biden and his father Joe Biden in 2016. Fox now claims that Hunter was signed up to hold onto a payment for his father in a deal with a Chinese energy firm

The email had already been published by the New York Post on Thursday but the identity of 'the Big Guy' was not known.

Titled 'Expectations', it details 'remuneration packages' for six people in a business venture.

Hunter was identified as the 'chair/vice chair depending on agreement with CEFC', an apparent reference to the now bankrupt Shanghai conglomerate China Energy Co.

His pay was '850' and the correspondence also noted how he 'has some office expectations he will elaborate'.

Extracts from one email published Thursday by the New York Post show how Hunter Biden was to be paid $850,000 in part of his arrangement with the Chinese firm

The email also outlines a 'provisional agreement' where 80 per cent of the 'equity' would be shared equally among four people whose initials appear to relate to Hunter and three other recipients.

The sender of the email, Gilliar, said: 'I am happy to raise any detail with Zang if there is shortfalls?'

The email divides the equity into '20 H' - meaning 20 per cent equity to Hunter; 20 per cent to RW, meaning Rob Walker, also of the jc2r consultancy; 20 per cent to another man called Tony Bubulinski.

The remaining 20 per cent was split with 10 per cent going to 'Jim' who is otherwise unnamed, and then '10 held by H for the big guy?'

The big guy was previously unnamed until Fox claimed Friday that it was in reference to Joe Biden.

Zang appears to be a reference to Zang Jian Jun who was the former executive director of CEFC.

According to the alleged emails published by the Post about huis Chinese dealings, Hunter also struck a deal for $30 million plus bonuses 'based on introductions alone' over three years after his father left office, then was offered a 'much more lasting and lucrative arrangement.'

The trove of emails have set of a series of political shockwaves including:

The laptop was revealed to include a picture of Hunter with what appears to be a crack pipe, and an 11-minute sex and drug video which is still to be seen;

Donald Trump seized on the release - orchestrated by his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani - to call his rival 'a corrupt politician';

Senate Republicans said they will investigate the first tranche of emails, from Hunter's Ukrainian business partners, which appear to show the Burisma energy aide being introduced to Joe Biden when he was vice president;

Democrats accusing Giuliani of peddling 'misinformation' and 'parading around with a Russian agent'.

The Chinese emails focus on Hunter's dealings with Ye Jianming, the former chairman of CEFC in 2017, after his father had left office and when it was thought he would not run in 2020.

Ye has not been seen since he was taken into custody by Chinese authorities in 2018 amid rumored links to the Chinese military and intelligence services.

It was previously known that he gave Hunter a diamond

CEFC went bankrupt earlier this year after it was unable to repay its huge debts after warnings over its lack of transparency and dealings with sanctioned Russian firms.

New leaked emails said to be from Hunter Biden show his apparent involvement with major Chinese firms as he discussed lucrative deals that would be 'interesting for me and my family'

Hunter is said to have struck deals with Ye Jianming, the former chairman of CEFC, who has not been seen since his arrest in 2018

WHO'S WHO IN THE HUNTER CHINESE EMAILS Hunter Biden Vice president's son was well-known to be seeking business deals in China. He traveled there in 2013 on Air Force Two and introduced his father to a business partner, Jonathan Li. In 2017, after his father left office, he pursued a relationship with Ye Jianming Ye Jianming Chairman and founder of CEFC China Energy, 43. A wunderkind of the Chinese energy world. Gave Hunter a diamond in 2017 as they pursued a business relationship. But in November 2017 company was accused of bribery in Africa by the DOJ, and in March 2018 he was arrested in China, reportedly on the orders of Xi Jinping. Has not been seen or heard from since but a prosecution in 2018 saw a senior Communist leader accused of taking bribes from him Zang Jian Jun Senior executive at CEFC and also a senior figure in the China Chamber of International Commerce Tony Bobulinski Penn State wrestler and Navy veteran turned-California businessman, 48, who appears to have done other business in China. Unclear how he and Gilliar know each other. Other business ventures include an investment in a Chinese men's clothing company called VLOV James Gilliar British-born 56-year-old businessman based in the Czech Republic. Set up jc2r, the company which is in the emails, in 2015. It is no longer active. Gilliar appears to breed race horses with his wife, Erika and appears to also be an adviser to a holding company run by the leader of Abu Dhabi's son The Big Guy and Jim Unidentified - and certain to set off a string of conspiracy theories.

In another 2017 email, Hunted reportedly discussed a deal with Ye. According to the leaked emails, Biden wrote that Ye had been influential in improving a three-year consulting contract with CEFC that would pay him $10million annually just for introductions.

He was given half ownership of a holding company to sweeten the deal, with Ye owning the other half.

According to the leaked emails, Biden wrote: 'Consulting fees is one piece of our income stream but the reason this proposal by the chairman was so much more interesting to me and my family is that we would also be partners inn the equity and profits of the JV's [joint venture's] investments.'

His email was sent to Gongwen Dong who has been linked to the purchase of two luxury Manhattan apartments for a total of $83million, which were bought by companies linked to Ye, according to the Wall Street Journal.

A photo from August 2017 appears to show a flowchart of the ownership of Hudson West which is split equally between Hunter Biden and 'Chairman'.

A report on Biden's business dealings released last month found Hudson West III opened a line of credit in September 2017.

Credit cards issued against the account were used by Hunter, his uncle James and James's wife Sara.

They purchased more than $100,000 worth of items including airline tickets, Apple products, hotel and restaurant bookings, according to the report released by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).

Hudson West has since been dissolved and Hunter's law firm Owaco PC was one of its two owners the report said.

Also seen in the emails was an agreement from one of Ye's associates to pay Biden a retainer of $1million for counsel on US law.

The offer was made by former Hong Kong government official Chi Ping Patrick Ho, who has been convicted in Manhattan for two schemes to pay $3million in bribes to African government officials for oil rights.

He served a prison sentence of three years and was deported to Hong Kong in June.

The new revelations come after emails come from Hunter's laptop appeared to show him making an introduction between his powerful father and a Ukrainian energy firm on Wednesday.

Gas company Burisma' adviser Vadym Pozharskyi thanked Hunter for 'an opportunity to meet your father' in an email sent in 2015, according to the stash of data given to the New York Post by Rudy Giuliani.

Biden dismissed the findings, and his spokesman Andrew Bates said the paper 'never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of this story...moreover, we have reviewed Joe Bidenâ€™s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place.'

Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has been probing Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine

The Democratic candidate's son's photos were part of the laptop which was obtained by Rudy Giuliani's attorney and has now been released by the president's lawyer

The emails are among a trove being referenced by Giuliani and his team after the owner of a computer repair shop in Delaware recovered data from a MacBook pro laptop that was dropped off and never retrieved.

The computer was seized by the FBI and its contents shared with the Post by Giuliani.

Giuliani's lawyer Bob Costello said there are some 40,000 emails on the hard drive including thousands of texts. It also includes images of Hunter 'in very compromising positions,' Costello told Fox News.

There has been no comment on the new emails from Biden's campaign, his lawyer, nor the Chinese businessman.

But Biden's lawyer has previously dismissed the stories, accusing Giuliani of dishonesty.

On Thursday, the Washington Post claimed that the White House was warned last year that Giuliani could be used to spread Russian misinformation.

The former NYC mayor hit back on Friday claiming that he was never warned himself that he could have been used by a Russian intelligence agent to spread false information to the US.

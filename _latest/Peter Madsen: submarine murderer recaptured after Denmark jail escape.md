  Peter Madsen: submarine murderer recaptured after Denmark jail escape 
description: > 
  A Danish man convicted of torturing and murdering a Swedish journalist on his homemade submarine escaped the suburban Copenhagen jail where he is serving a life sentence but was found nearby on Tuesday.The Ekstra Bladet tabloid posted a video of Peter Madsen sitting in the grass with his hands behind his back and police at a distance.According to the daily, Madsen “had a belt-like object around the abdomen”.In 2018, Madsen was sentenced in the Copenhagen city court to life in prison for killing Kim Wall, a 30-year-old reporter from Sweden whom he lured aboard his homemade submarine in 2017 with the promise of an interview.Madsen lost his appeal, shortly after apologising to the victim’s family who were present in the appeals court.

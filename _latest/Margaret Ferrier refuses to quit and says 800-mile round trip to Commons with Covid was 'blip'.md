Margaret Ferrier has defied calls for her to resign as an MP over her 800-mile round-trip from Scotland to the Commons while suffering from coronavirus, claiming her actions were a "blip."

The Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP blamed "muddled rules" for the trip, which she made by train, and hit out at "friends and colleagues" who have urged her to quit.

Ms Ferrier insisted she would not stand down and trigger a by-election, claiming Covid "makes you act out of character" and that she was "not thinking straight" when she made the journey.

The SNP stripped her of the party whip for putting people's lives at risk but is yet to expel her from the party.

Ms Ferrier said she was "utterly shocked" when she received her positive Covid result two days after she had displayed symptoms and was tested in Scotland, but her attitude was described as "exceptionally arrogant" by Annie Wells, a Tory MSP, who said: "She put lives at risk. Time to go."

Nicola Sturgeon repeated her call for Ms Ferrier to resign her seat but stressed that the party would have to go through "due process" before expelling her.

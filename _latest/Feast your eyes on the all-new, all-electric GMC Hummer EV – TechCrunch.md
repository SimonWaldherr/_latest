  Feast your eyes on the all-new, all-electric GMC Hummer EV – TechCrunch 
description: > 
  GMC has a new all-electric version of its classic Hummer oversized SUV.This thing is a beast, as you might expect, with an advertised 350-mile range and a 3-second zero to 60 mph time.It’s a bit ridiculous to be honest, which is kind of what the Hummer has always been about so that makes sense.Alongside a teaser, GMC released a number of press photos of the 1,000 HP bruiser, so take a look below.It definitely looks like a Hummer – which may or may not be your cup of tea.

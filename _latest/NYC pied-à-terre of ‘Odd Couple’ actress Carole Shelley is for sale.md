When renowned actress Carole Shelley passed away in 2018, she left fans mourning her triumphs on the big screen and Broadway: notably, her portrayal of Gwendolyn Pigeon in “The Odd Couple.”

She was one half of the kooky Pigeon sisters, who played Oscar and Felix’s upstairs neighbors in the stage, film and TV versions of the classic New York City comedy.

British-born Shelley also left some real estate — her spacious one-bedroom, one-bathroom pied-à-terre in Midtown Manhattan — to her godson Mark Holden-Hindley.

Now Holden-Hindley, a polar explorer and former horse show jumper involved in movie production who now runs lavish family estate Edenhall in the north of England, has put his godmother’s co-op on the market for $1.35 million.

Located in the classic Parc Vendôme building at 340 W. 57th St., the 14th-floor unit has a home office, a wood-burning fireplace, 9-foot-high beamed ceilings, arches, original oak-plank floors, an original cast-iron deep tub and built-in bedroom closets.

Shelley bought the unit for $1.2 million in 2007, according to city records. She died at age 79 on Aug. 31, 2018.

Holden-Hindley’s late mother, Aude, and Shelley were best friend since the women were 18. Aude served as Shelley’s agent for 47 years, Holden-Hindley told Gimme Shelter.

The Brit says he has fond memories of visiting Shelley, who had no children of her own, with his mother, spending time at the apartment and watching her on stage.

“I was devoted to her and loved her dearly,” he said. “She was a great part of my life, and I was so proud to visit her, be part of her life and see her on Broadway.”

Shelley played Madame Morrible in the original Broadway production of “Wicked,” and won a Tony for her role in the 1979 Broadway version of “The Elephant Man.”

Building amenities include (appropriately) formal English tea gardens with a fountain — as well as rooftop sundecks, a billiard room, a music room, a club room, a library, a private dining room and a banquet room with a catering kitchen.

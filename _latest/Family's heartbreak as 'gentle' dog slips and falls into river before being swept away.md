There has been a lot of rain recently so as he [Barney] was trotting along, he lost his footing and slid down into the water and then he was really quickly pulled under." </p> <p>Charlotte and her sister tried their hardest to find him but along the river there were established trees and bushes in the way - it was too dangerous for them to continue looking.</p> <p>Charlotte continued: "Tragically we couldn't find him."</p>

 <p>     </p> <p>They had to leave without Barney and have returned on Monday (October 19) to search for him again but have so far been unsuccessful.</p> <p>Charlotte and Natalie are asking for anyone who might be in the area where Barney drowned to keep an eye out for him.</p> <p>As there are so many fallen trees and debris in the water they believe Barney's body won't have travelled far.</p> <p>Natalie is Barney's owner and got him as a rescue dog more than three years ago,</p> <p>Natalie said: "We just want to be able to bring him home anddon't want him to be left there."</p> <p>She went on to describe Barney as "the perfect dog".</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>She said: "He was really gentle, kind. He loved his walks and wanted to be with us all the time. He used to follow us around and used to go with a dog walker in the week and she really loved him.</p> <p>"In the pub in the village people adored him, he was such a character and had so much expression in his face."</p> <p>Barney is brown and white and will be wearing his black collar and harness. Anyone who finds him should call the contact number on his collar.</p></div>

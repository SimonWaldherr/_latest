Director Edgar Wright announced last night that iconic Bond actress and visual artist Margaret Nolan has died, aged 76. Wright – who worked with Nolan on his upcoming film Last Night in Soho – said that Nolan was at the centre of a venn diagram of “everything that was cool” in the Sixties: “Having appeared with the Beatles, been beyond iconic in Bond and been part of the Carry On cast too.”

It’s her small but significant role in Goldfinger for which Nolan is best known; a literally golden cinematic legacy. Shirley Eaton played the role of Jill Masterson, the (inevitably) tragic Bond girl killed by gold paint (official cause of death: "skin suffocation"). But it was Margaret Nolan whose painted body appeared in the film’s opening titles and posters.

Indeed, if Goldfinger was the film that created the formula that defined every subsequent Bond film ­– defined either by or against it – Margaret Nolan was its glimmering centrepiece. Goldfinger, the definitive Bond film, was sold on Margaret Nolan's image.

Born in Hampstead in 1943, Nolan had intended to become a teacher, but was persuaded to act by her first husband, Tom Kempinski, who was an actor himself. After a year of glamour modelling, under the name Vicky Kennedy, Nolan landed her first TV role in 1963, playing alongside future 007 Roger Moore in The Saint. In 1964, she made a small appearance in The Beatles’ debut film, A Hard Day’s Night. Goldfinger was released later that same year.

Nolan was just 20 years old when she was cast for the title sequence. Producers wanted Nolan for her body. She agreed but shrewdly negotiated a small acting role too, playing Bond’s masseuse Dink. Not only is Nolan remembered for the iconic titles, but as recipient of old school Bond’s everyday sexism.

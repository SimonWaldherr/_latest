  Biden dominating Trump in ad-spending wars, outspending the president 2-to-1 
description: > 
  Donald Trump is being hugely outspent by Democratic rival Joe Biden in television advertising in 2020 election battleground states.The Biden campaign has held a 2-to-1 advantage over the Trump campaign since the summer, with the difference particularly pronounced in critical swing states that will prove key to winning the White House.Biden has spent $74m, while Trump has spent $53m.The Biden campaign ran 38 different ads in the last month in Pennsylvania alone, a state that Trump won by fewer than 50,000 votes in 2016.Approximately 80 per cent of the Trump campaign ads, and 60 per cent of the Biden campaignâ€™s, are negative, attacking the opponent and pushing how their candidate is a contrast on whatever issue on which the ad focuses.

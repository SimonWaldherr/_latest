<div><p>A Florida deputy was busted for convincing two children that demons were inside their home, leading cops to find the youngsters armed with a rifle, Taser and body armor &#8212; and ready to shoot whoever entered, authorities alleged.</p>
<p>Orange County Deputy Christopher Dougherty was arrested Sunday on child abuse charges three days after deputies responded to a home for a residential alarm call and found &#8220;evidence of child abuse&#8221; there, the Orange County Sheriff&#8217;s Office said.</p>
<p>He and the children, whose ages were not provided, each had weapons in their possession when deputies responded to the residence, according to an arrest affidavit <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ne-orange-deputy-arrested-child-abuse-20201019-zpnyrje32zbwvobb67ihd4ch6q-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">obtained by the Orlando Sentinel</a>.</p>
<p>Dougherty had a handgun on him at the time, as one of the children was lying in a shooting position while gripping a rifle and wearing body armor and a Kevlar helmet, the affidavit states.</p>
<p>The second child, meanwhile, allegedly had a Taser. Dougherty told the youngsters that there were demons in the house and to shoot anyone who entered, the children told authorities, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Deputies took Dougherty, 37, to a hospital, where he was held under the state&#8217;s Baker Act, which allows the involuntary institutionalization of someone deemed to be a threat to themselves or others.</p>
<p>He was arrested Sunday upon his release from the hospital and subsequently fired from the department for poor performance in an unrelated matter, sheriff officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this deputy was terminated for a pattern of unsatisfactory performance, these are very serious criminal allegations,&#8221; Sheriff John Mina said in a statement. &#8220;As law enforcement officers, we are held to the highest standards of conduct whether on duty or off duty. But we are also concerned about the deputy&#8217;s mental health.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Orange County Sheriff&#8217;s Office spokesperson declined to indicate whether Dougherty &#8212; who was hired in 2006 and worked in the agency&#8217;s uniform patrol division &#8212; is the father of the children or to provide their ages or gender.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no additional information for us to provide,&#8221; the spokesperson wrote in an email Monday to The Post. &#8220;That is an active criminal investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheriff officials did not provide details Monday on the unrelated manner that led to his termination.</p>

  Questor: ‘Frontier’ markets are more Covid-proof – and extremely cheap 
description: > 
  Western countries may have the most advanced hospitals and the best‑trained doctors but many undeveloped nations have other defences against coronavirus: young populations and low incidence of obesity and cardiovascular disease, the types of condition that tend to turn Covid-19 from mild to serious or even fatal.These countries have been less affected by the pandemic “on every single metric” and “less than you would expect for such dense populations”, said one fund manager who invests in these regions.Sam Vecht, co-manager of the BlackRock Frontiers investment trust, which focuses on countries one step behind those regarded as “emerging”, pointed out that some frontier nations, such as Bangladesh, were also well used to coping with regular disasters and “have a great deal of in-built flexibility in their workforces and economies”.He said: “Some of these countries have dealt with problems in the recent past in a way we in Britain, for example, have not had to in our lifetimes.”All this has not stopped stocks in these parts of the world trading at very low valuations.“Many of our markets continue to look very compelling at their current valuation, trading at less than nine times historic earnings and in some cases close to global financial crisis levels,” Mr Vecht and Emily Fletcher, his co-manager, told investors at the end of August.“Despite the [post-March] bounce, the portfolio is still around the lowest valuation levels that we have seen in the last 10 years.”The kind of stocks the trust could potentially invest in have been trading at a discount of about 40pc relative to developed market equivalents on the basis of the “price-to-book” ratio (book refers to the book value of firms’ assets) and the managers think this discount may narrow after the pandemic as investors search for growth and yield.

<div><p>Western countries may have the most advanced hospitals and the best&#8209;trained doctors but many undeveloped nations have other defences against coronavirus: young populations and low incidence of obesity and cardiovascular disease, the types of condition that&#160;tend to turn Covid-19 from mild to serious or even fatal.</p>
<p>These countries have been less affected by the pandemic &#8220;on every single metric&#8221; and &#8220;less than you would expect for such dense populations&#8221;, said one fund manager who invests in these regions.</p>
<p>Sam Vecht, co-manager of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/markets-hub/share/S1457/BRFI/BlackRockFrontiersInvestmentTrustPLC">BlackRock Frontiers investment trust</a>, which focuses on countries one step behind those regarded as &#8220;emerging&#8221;, pointed out that some frontier nations, such as Bangladesh, were also well used to coping with regular disasters and &#8220;have a great deal of in-built flexibility in their workforces and economies&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Some of these countries have dealt with problems in the recent past in a way we in Britain, for example, have not had to in our lifetimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this has not stopped stocks in these parts of the&#160;world trading at very low valuations.&#8220;Many of our markets continue to look very compelling at their current valuation, trading at less than nine times historic earnings and in some cases close to global financial crisis levels,&#8221; Mr Vecht and Emily Fletcher, his co-manager, told investors at the end of August.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the [post-March] bounce, the portfolio is still around the lowest valuation levels that we have seen in the last 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kind of stocks the trust could potentially invest in have been trading at a discount of about 40pc relative to developed market equivalents on the basis of the &#8220;price-to-book&#8221; ratio (book refers to the book value of firms&#8217; assets) and the managers think this discount may narrow after the pandemic as investors search for growth and yield.</p>

​Michael Gove has called on Sir Keir Starmer to “pick up the phone” and tell local Labour leaders in Manchester to “show leadership” by agreeing to place the region under tier three restrictions.

In the latest war of words between ministers and Andy Burnham, Mr Gove accused the mayor of Greater Manchester of “posturing” and urged him to accept the additional measures to “save people’s lives.”

With neither side willing to budge after a week of fierce political wrangling, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster added that Manchester’s leadership were making a “mistake” by delaying and signalled that the changes could still be imposed without their consent.

"I want them to put aside for a moment some of the political positioning that they've indulged in and I want them to work with us in order to ensure that we save lives and protect the NHS,” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge programme.

"Instead of press conferences and posturing what we need is action to save people's lives.

“If Labour are serious about the NHS and about this disease, then here they would be calling on Andy Burnham and inviting Andy Burnham to accept the need for these measures.”

Speaking shortly afterwards, Mr Burnham returned fire by accusing the Prime Minister of exaggerating the severity of the crisis in Manchester.

Ahead of a crunch meeting with Downing Street on Saturday afternoon, he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: "It's a serious situation but I don't think it was the situation that was described by the Prime Minister on Friday evening. I think it was an exaggeration of the position that we're in.

"Of course it's a matter of concern, and we watch the figures very closely indeed, but the figures have been falling in Manchester itself in the last few days, across Greater Manchester up slightly but certainly not doubling every nine days."

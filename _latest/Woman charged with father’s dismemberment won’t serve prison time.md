<div><p>A San Francisco woman won&#8217;t serve any prison time for dismembering her elderly dad, whose severed head and other body parts were discovered in a refrigerator, a court ruled.</p>
<p>Stephanie Ching, 36, was sentenced Tuesday after pleading guilty to being an accessory after the fact and desecration of human remains in the death of her 73-year-old father, Benedict Ching, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/No-prison-time-for-San-Francisco-woman-charged-in-15662965.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the San Francisco Chronicle reported</a>.</p>
<p>Ching struck a plea deal with prosecutors for a suspended term of three years in prison in addition to one year in jail.</p>
<p>But she will receive time served for the 17 months she has spent in jail, enabling her to be released to begin three years of probation, the outlet reported.</p>
<p>Her husband, Douglas Lomas, 45, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and was sentenced to six years in prison, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Officers stumbled across the gruesome scene at Benedict&#8217;s home in Ingleside in May 2019 after a colleague contacted his family to report that he didn&#8217;t show up to work.</p>
<p>They found body parts including a severed head in the refrigerator, in addition to a circular saw in his bathtub, police said.</p>
<p>Stephanie and her husband were captured with help from Homeland Security agents after they caught a flight to Beijing with their two children.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged the couple &#8220;exhibited no remorse or concern for the death of the victim, and hastily fled to China as family members began to question the victim&#8217;s whereabouts,&#8221; <a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/couple-takes-plea-deals-in-dismemberment-of-elderly-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the San Francisco Examiner reported</a>.</p>
<p>The medical examiner&#8217;s office couldn&#8217;t determine a cause of death in part because the body had been dismembered, the outlet reported.</p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Linda Colfax said Tuesday at the hearing that Benedict may have been the &#8220;initiator or aggressor&#8221; &#8212; noting he subjected his daughter to abuse &#8220;dating back to childhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added that prosecutors had never revealed a motive in the case &#8220;despite the shocking actions of the defendants subsequent to Mr. Ching&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>

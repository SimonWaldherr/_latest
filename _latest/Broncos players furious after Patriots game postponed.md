Broncos players are fuming over the second postponement of their Week 5 matchup against the Patriots.

A number of players took to social media to vent that they were being unfairly punished for the Patriots’ COVID-19 cases after the Patriots had a fourth player test positive Sunday morning.

“Ain’t no way we practiced all week and they canceled our game,” star running back Melvin Gordon wrote on Twitter.

“Injuries at an all time high and our bye week was burned up with practices,” free safety Justin Simmons wrote in a quote-tweet of Gordon.

2020 first-rounder Jerry Jeudy posted a succinct tweet of an emoji of a man face-palming to indicate his frustration.

The game had already been moved from Sunday to Monday after 2019 Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore tested positive for coronavirus earlier in the week, which shut down the Patriots’ facilities. Quarterback Cam Newton had tested positive the week prior on Oct. 3 and remains on the COVID-19/reserve list. Broncos players were already frustrated with the initial change.

“Why are we getting punished when we did nothing wrong,” defensive end Shelby Harris wrote on Thursday. “Pats go on a bye next week and we are stuck on a short week playing the dolphins help it make sense.”

Offensive tackle Calvin Anderson also wrote Thursday that the Broncos followed protocols and have had zero positives.

“Result when opponent has multiple positive tests: -Game is postponed and our team is forced into a short week the following game. Hmm,” Anderson wrote.

The Patriots vs. Broncos game has been tentatively rescheduled to be played on Sunday Oct. 18 as reported by ESPN’s Adam Schefter. Both teams will lose their bye later this season.

This week’s Titans-Bills game is still scheduled to be played on Tuesday.

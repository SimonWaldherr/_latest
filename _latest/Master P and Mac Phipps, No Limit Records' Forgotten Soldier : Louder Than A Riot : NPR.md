The Camouflage Assassin: Mac Phipps (Pt 1)

This is a story of race, corruption and rap on trial.

Born and raised in New Orleans, rapper Mac Phipps went from local favorite to national fame in the late '90s, thanks to a record deal with Master P's No Limit Records. The only catch? No Limit was known for its aggressive sound, so Mac switched up his image — a small price to pay for making his life's dream come true.

That dream would turn into a nightmare on Feb. 20, 2000, just as Mac was set to perform at a small hole-in-the-wall club in St. Tammany, a parish near New Orleans. A fight broke out on the dance floor, leaving one man dead from a single gunshot wound. Witnesses identified Mac as the trigger man. Police arrested Mac and charged him with murder.

Over the next three episodes, we look at Louisiana's tough-on-crime mentality through the story of one of No Limit's fallen soldiers, an artist who has been fighting to clear his name for 20 years.

Lara Trump sparred with CNN’s Jake Tapper over Joe Biden’s campaign performances on Sunday after the president’s daughter-in-law suggested the former vice president is in “cognitive decline.”

The tense exchange began when the CNN’s “State of the Union” host asked Trump about comments she made saying she feels “bad” for Biden when he comes on stage and can’t “get the words out.”

Trump, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign who is married to son Eric Trump, said at the time she made those comments she didn’t know that the Democratic presidential candidate was a stutterer.

“First and foremost, I had no idea that Joe Biden ever suffered from a stutter,” she said. “I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline. That’s what I’m referring to. It makes me uncomfortable.”

Tapper accused her of “mocking his stutter” and suggested that she has “no standing to diagnose somebody’s cognitive decline.”

“I would think that somebody in the family would be more sensitive to people who do not have medical licenses diagnosing politicians from afar. Plenty of people have diagnosed your father from afar, and I’m sure it offends you,” he said.

Lara Trump hit back that she was “not diagnosing him.”

“What I’m saying, Jake, is that Joe Biden is struggling when he’s on stage. And it’s very concerning to a lot of people that this could be the leader of the free world,” she said.

At that point, Tapper said he was “sure” her comments came from a “place of concern,” thanked her for being a guest and moved on to the next segment.

Canada’s first known case of coronavirus appeared on Jan. 25. A man who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, China tested positive for the virus. His wife tested positive a day later.

Quebec soon became the province most severely affected, likely because its winter school break, which saw many families travel to the southern United States and other warm weather destinations, occurred two weeks before provincial lockdown measures began to sweep the country in mid-March.

On March 21, Canada closed its border with the United States, with exceptions for freight movements and some essential workers. It was the first time the entire border had been shut since Canada became a nation in 1867.

For the most part, the handling of the virus outbreak has not become a partisan or politicized issue and politicians have generally deferred to public health officials about how to handle it. While some provinces began easing some restrictions in early May, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said that a substantial relaxation remains at least weeks and possibly months away.

The New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

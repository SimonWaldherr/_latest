Zeidler Municipal Building in downtown Milwaukee by 7:30 a.m., as crowds waited for more than two hours to cast their ballots on the first day of early voting in Wisconsin.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Jon Berlin, 70, a psychiatrist, arrived with his partner, Susan Hrlevich, 60, at 5:20 a.m. The pair, who are independent voters, wore parkas and brought folding canvas chairs as they walked from their downtown residence to cast votes for Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">They said they feared even longer lines &#8212; and exposure to the coronavirus &#8212; if they had waited until Nov. 3 to vote.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel safe in this country for the first time,&#8221; said Mr. Berlin. &#8220;We have this horrible pandemic and we need a leader who can face the truth and tell the truth.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Early voting has drawn crowds around the nation, and both campaigns are seeking to turn out their supporters. Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden&#8217;s running mate, planned to participate in a virtual Milwaukee rally with Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and several local officials to encourage early voting there.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Chrystal Gillon-Mabry, a 68-year-old artist, and her sister, Coral Hegwood, 59, a retired city employee, brought books to read and chairs when they arrived before 5:30 a.m.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Hegwood said that she was still undecided as she stood in line. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to vote for Trump, but I don&#8217;t want to compromise my Christian beliefs,&#8221; she said. Afterward, she said she had voted for Mr. Biden. &#8220;I prayed and prayed on it,&#8221; she said, concluding that &#8220;Biden has more compassion than Trump &#8212; he has no compassion or empathy for anybody.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Before in-person early voting began Tuesday, more than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://elections.wi.gov/node/7192" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">915,000 Wisconsinites had voted</a> since officials began mailing absentee ballots Sept. 17, a figure that amounts to about 30 percent of the state&#8217;s total vote in 2016.

No other county&#8217;s turnout eclipsed more than 37 percent of its 2016 numbers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While Wisconsin Democrats have encouraged voters to cast ballots as soon as they are able, the state&#8217;s Republican Party urged supporters to wait until early voting began. &#8220;Avoid the long lines on Election Day,&#8221; read a flyer the Republican Party of Wisconsin mailed to supporters last week, urging them to make plans to vote early, which the state describes as voting &#8220;absentee&#8221; in person. The mailing made no mention of voting by mail.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Denise Williams, 67, who uses a walker and has been staying mostly at home since the pandemic, was glad to socialize &#8212; from at least a few feet apart &#8212; with fellow voters, all of whom wore masks. She arrived at 6 a.m. and waited almost three hours.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Our country is too divided, I want it back together again,&#8221; said Ms. Williams, a retired nursing assistant who voted for Mr. Biden. She would have voted by mail, she said, but she never received a ballot. &#8220;I wanted to make sure my vote got in, and with my health, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll be on Election Day.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  Kay Nolan and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/reid-j-epstein" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="florida-sees-a-record-early-vote-with-democrats-casting-more-mail-in-ballots-than-republicans"></p><p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70">THE EARLY VOTE</p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#florida-sees-a-record-early-vote-with-democrats-casting-more-mail-in-ballots-than-republicans">Florida sees a record early vote, with Democrats casting more mail-in ballots than Republicans.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="As Florida broke records for early voting, a poll worker collected ballots in Westchester, Fla.&#160;" class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20elections-briefing-florida/merlin_178766826_45b6d120-6623-4df6-a107-19a716d9218b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">As Florida broke records for early voting, a poll worker collected ballots in Westchester, Fla.&#160;</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Saul Martinez for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">When early voting began in Florida on Monday,  366,436 Floridians went to the polls and cast ballots in person, according to data collected <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by the United States Elections Project.</a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The total eclipsed the record set on the first day of early, in-person voting four years ago, when about 291,000 people cast ballots,<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article246505920.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> according to The Miami Herald.</a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Including mailed-in ballots, more than three million people have now voted so far this year in Florida.

A day earlier, Mr. Trump repeatedly called his opponent &#8220;a criminal,&#8221; using the same word for a reporter he chided for not focusing on the Post story. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president has repeatedly called on Mr. Barr to intervene in issues since he was confirmed by the Senate. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"> Mr. Biden is leading or tied with Mr. Trump in nearly every public poll in the battleground states that handed Mr. Trump his 2016 victory.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has significantly cut into Mr. Trump&#8217;s edge on issues like the economy, and the president&#8217;s poor performance in handling the pandemic has brought his poll numbers down. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president made the comments during an interview in which his answers were studded with lies and falsehoods about a range of issues, and in which he criticized the Bidens, the news media and the infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony S. Fauci.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After spending Monday attacking Dr. Fauci, who remains popular in public opinion polls, Mr. Trump claimed Tuesday he was &#8220;not at odds&#8221; with him, before renewing the attacks. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president falsely described Dr. Fauci as a &#8220;Democrat,&#8221; and claimed he was a &#8220;good friend&#8221; of the family of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;He&#8217;s been there for a long time, I leave him there, and he&#8217;s been wrong,&#8221; Mr. Trump said of Dr. Fauci. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He then accused reporters of favoring Dr. Fauci &#8220;because they think he&#8217;s against me.&#8221; </p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="new-ads-put-poll-workers-at-center-stage-to-shore-up-faith-in-voting-system"></p><p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70">Ad Watch</p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#new-ads-put-poll-workers-at-center-stage-to-shore-up-faith-in-voting-system">New ads put poll workers at center stage to shore up faith in voting system.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A series of ads featuring poll workers and election officials begins airing Tuesday, meant to assure Americans that the voting process is safe and secure. The $1.7 million campaign was produced by VoteSafe, a bipartisan voting rights group, and it says as much about the national psyche as it does about the political race.</p><p class="css-1u3pw94"></p><h3 class="css-5lxzui e1gnsphs0" id="link-708ecc6a"><p>The Message</p></h3><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In one ad, Sue from Pennsylvania introduces herself as &#8220;an Army wife, a mother, a grandmother and a die-hard believer in our right to vote.&#8221; She is not a politician, she says.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She is a poll worker, who has worked in Pennsylvania for the last eight years. As she is shown setting up a polling location and placing bilingual &#8220;Vote Aqu&#237;/Here&#8221; signs outside a community center near Easton, Pa., Sue addresses concerns about whether voting will be secure this November.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Her answer is clear.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I know the process.

But rather than turn to celebrities or lawmakers to defend the system, VoteSafe&#8217;s use of trusted and familiar local elections workers could help the ads land among an increasingly skeptical public.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nick-corasaniti" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="big-donors-play-a-key-and-quiet-role-in-the-biden-campaign"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#big-donors-play-a-key-and-quiet-role-in-the-biden-campaign">Big donors play a key, and quiet, role in the Biden campaign.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Joe Biden arrived at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Del., Monday to film a &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20elections-briefing-bidendonors/merlin_178759257_adaf72f2-7852-44fb-98c1-97af08ef5ef0-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Joe Biden arrived at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Del., Monday to film a &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Hilary Swift for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">One evening last month, about 100,000 people watched and donated to a virtual fund-raiser for the Biden campaign featuring Hillary Clinton, Senator Kamala Harris, and two actors who portrayed them on &#8220;Saturday Night Live,&#8221; Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph.

  Hitchcock’s Rebecca was perfect – why did Netflix feel entitled to ‘update’ it? 
description: > 
  In the novel, Maxim murders Rebecca, but in 1940 the Hollywood Production Code would not allow a murderer to go unpunished.She does not know whether to love or hate Maxim; neither does the production unit; neither does the viewer.He wanted Robert Donat for Maxim but took Laurence Olivier, who delivered a superb performance; that is, for once he didn’t over-act.Olivier wanted his lover Vivien Leigh to play the girl, but Hitchcock wouldn’t have it: Leigh was too beautiful.The idea was laughable, and Leigh’s screen test, which is online, proves it: she could only have played Rebecca.

<div><p>In the novel, Maxim murders Rebecca, but in 1940 the Hollywood Production Code would not allow a murderer to go unpunished. It was downgraded to manslaughter. There was an opportunity here for the new Rebecca. It could have been a film about a bisexual narcissist and her murderous husband, told from the vantage point of his new victim; it could have skewered our obsession with aristocracy.&#160;</p>
<p>There is one scene in a car, with music, where this narrative begins to flower &#8211; where something original rises in this Rebecca &#8211; but it flies away. The problem of the film mirrors the problem of the girl. She does not know whether to love or hate Maxim; neither does the production unit; neither does the viewer.</p>
<p>Hitchcock could not have made that film in 1940. He wanted Robert Donat for Maxim but took Laurence Olivier, who delivered a superb performance; that is, for once he didn&#8217;t over-act. He is brusque and distracted. Olivier wanted his lover Vivien Leigh to play the girl, but Hitchcock wouldn&#8217;t have it: Leigh was too beautiful. The idea was laughable, and Leigh&#8217;s screen test, which is online, proves it: she could only have played Rebecca.&#160;</p>

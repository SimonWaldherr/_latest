or face being forced into tougher coronavirus curbs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick warned that talks had gone on 'too long' and the government could force the issue as early as tomorrow unless the region accepts a package of funding to ease the impact, thought to be worth up to &#163;100million.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The threat came after doctors voiced alarm that Manchester is at risk of running out of hospital beds for COVID, with the bitter standoff now having delayed a clampdown by days.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But along with the war of words with Mr Burnham and Labour, the wrangling is also at risk of tearing the Conservative Party apart - as local MPs including 1922 committee chair Sir Graham Brady dismiss the need for the highest levels of restrictions.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a brutal response from 'Red Wall' MPs on Tory WhatsApp groups after colleagues from Tier One sent a letter to Mr Burnham urging him to 'engage' with the Government's regional approach in order to spare other areas 'pain'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The intervention - which many believe was orchestrated by Downing Street - sparked furious private rows about an 'all-round shafting', with one MP reportedly jibing at another: 'You just want a promotion and you're happy to throw colleagues under a bus to achieve it.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Jenrick said: 'I do think it is very clear that having now discussed this for well over a week this does now need to be brought to a conclusion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think everybody in Greater Manchester would agree with that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So, I am hopeful that either today, or tomorrow, we will reach a conclusion, one way or the other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mr Burnham was still signalling defiance today, telling journalists: 'It's not about the size of the cheque, it's about protecting low-paid workers, people who are self-employed and supporting businesses.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool City Region received &#163;30million in support for local businesses when it went into Tier Three, along with &#163;14million for extra contact tracing capacity, and &#163;7million when it entered Tier Two.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adjusting the total package for the larger population in Manchester would give a figure of around &#163;95million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although Mr Burnham has been pushing for furlough to be paid at 80 per cent rather than the two-thirds offered by the government, that is paid centrally and separate from the bailouts.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other developments in the coronavirus crisis:&#160;</p><ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"><li class="class"><p class="mol-style-bold">A further 16,982 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK yesterday -

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The war of words grew increasingly bitter yesterday as Michael Gove accused Mr Burnham of 'posturing' amid talks between the PM's top adviser Sir Edward Lister, while the Manchester leader called for a Parliamentary vote on the city's fate to 'break the impasse'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, documents leaked to the <a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/18/revealed-some-manchester-area-hospitals-already-full">Guardian</a>&#160;suggested Greater Manchester is on track to run out of beds for coronavirus patients in the weeks ahead.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some 211 of the city's 257 critical care beds were being used for Covid patients or those with other serious illnesses - with 12 hospitals in the region already at full capacity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hospitals in Salford, Stockport and Bolton were already struggling to find beds to put the influx of 110 new patients with covid-19 needing vital treatment on Friday, the document stated.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson made a bid to break the deadlock last night by offering Greater Manchester tens of millions of pounds in extra support if the region agrees to accept the toughest level of lockdown restrictions.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But despite the overtures behind the scenes, the public war of words showed no sign of easing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove savaged the Greater Manchester mayor, warning his 'posturing' would cost lives in a city that has one of the highest Covid-19 rates in the country.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And&#160;James Daly, conservative MP for Bury North, said the mayor had still not spoken to him about his thoughts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told Sky News: 'I want them to put aside for a moment some of the political positioning that they've indulged in and I want them to work with us in order to ensure that we save lives and protect the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Instead of press conferences and posturing, what we need is action to save people's lives.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PM's senior adviser Sir Edward Lister held talks with Mr Burnham last night in which he is said to have made a significant new financial offer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whitehall sources said the cash could run into 'tens of millions' of pounds to help ensure compliance with the swingeing Tier Three restrictions ministers want to introduce.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The offer is in line with deals struck with Merseyside and Lancashire, which have both been granted an additional &#163;30million in recent days to help support businesses and jobs.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it falls short of Mr Burnham's demand for the furlough scheme to be extended in full to provide 80 per cent of the wages of those unable to work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its replacement, the Job Support Scheme, will provide only 66 per cent of wages, although ministers insist the low-paid will also get Universal Credit top-ups.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Burnham's office last night described the talks with Sir Edward as 'constructive', with the mayor expected to consult with other local leaders overnight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this morning&#160;James Daly, conservative MP for Bury North, said the mayor had still not spoken to him about his thoughts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told the Today programme: 'Myself and some of my colleagues in Greater Manchester thought it very important to set out our objections to some of the comments that were made by Labour figures and Mr Burnham yesterday regarding their desire to put greater Manchester into a national lockdown which we thing would be disastrous for both business and jobs</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But Mr Burnham doesn't have statutory responsibility for delivery of coronavirus measures so I think the things that's extremely important is that the Labour leader of Bury council;

<p class="mol-para-with-font">South Yorkshire is also thought to be close to agreeing on a package of Tier Three restrictions and support.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But attempts to isolate Mr Burnham politically have been undermined by the support of local Conservative MPs, who also oppose further restrictions in the region.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said politicians across Greater Manchester were 'pretty united' against the plans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told the BBC's Broadcasting House show that local MPs and council leaders had 'not been given the evidence it would be effective'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'We can see no reason for taking that significant economic hit especially if it does not come with full compensation for the economic hit when there is no evidence being advanced as to why it might work.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And he warned the PM not to impose the restrictions, adding: 'If you have got a situation where the MPs, the council leaders and the mayor are standing up for the people they represent, it would be unwise to impose it over their heads.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Burham has also called for a Commons vote this week to decide the level of financial aid for areas that are put into tier three.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, also questioned the value of further measures in Greater Manchester at this stage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, he said average cases in the city had fallen by 20 per cent in the first week of October, suggesting measures might be working already.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If policy keeps intervening at the first sight of rising cases then we will never learn if any given intervention has worked,' he said.

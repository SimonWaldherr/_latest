US President Donald Trump on Sunday declared himself immune to Covid-19 and ready for a fight as his White House race against surging rival Joe Biden enters its critical final weeks.

Mr Trump's doctors gave him the all-clear on Saturday to return to the campaign trail after he was ruled no longer a coronavirus transmission risk. On Sunday, while calling in to a campaign event, he said that he tested "totally negative".

But he has yet to be declared virus-free, and his immunity claim is unproven.

"It looks like I'm immune for, I don't know, maybe a long time and maybe a short time, it could be a lifetime, nobody really knows, but I'm immune," Mr Trump said.

"The word immunity means something, having really a protective glow.

"So now you have a president who doesn't have to hide in a basement like his opponent."

But it is not yet clear to what degree contracting Covid-19 offers immunity; with early studies suggesting a few months while newer ones have indicated it could last longer.

Twitter on Sunday hid a tweet from Mr Trump in which he claimed he was immune, saying the post violated its rules about misleading and potentially harmful misinformation.

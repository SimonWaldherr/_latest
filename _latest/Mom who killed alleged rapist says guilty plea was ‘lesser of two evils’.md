<div><p>The Alabama woman who admitted to killing her accused rapist, claiming she acted in self-defense, insists she chose the &#8220;lesser of two evils&#8221; by pleading guilty to the slaying rather than take a chance at trial.</p>
<p>Brittany Smith, a 33-year-old mother of four, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/12/woman-sentenced-to-20-years-for-killing-her-accused-rapist/">pleaded guilty in October</a> to murdering Todd Smith, a teenage friend she reconnected with days earlier who she claims strangled and raped her in January 2018 at her home in Stevenson.</p>
<p>Hours after the alleged assault, Brittany said she fatally shot Todd as he held her brother in a chokehold and threatened to kill them both. She opted to take a plea deal ahead of trial even though she thought a jury would acquit her, she <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/10/brittany-smith-talks-from-jail-about-pleading-guilty-to-shooting-the-man-she-says-raped-her.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told AL.com</a> in a jailhouse video interview.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really disappointed with having to take a plea deal,&#8221; Brittany told the outlet. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a murderer, but when it&#8217;s the lesser of two evils, what can you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Brittany, who received a 20-year sentence under the plea deal, was ordered to serve 18 months in a county lockup before spending another 18 months on house arrest &#8212; with the remainder to be served on probation, AL.com reported.</p>
<p>But due to credit for time served while awaiting trial, she&#8217;ll only spend about seven months in jail and will be released sometime next spring, her attorney told the outlet.</p>
<p>Still, significant personal challenges lie ahead, Brittany said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be really hard for me to get a job and get my kids back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know that my family will let me visit my kids but as far as them coming home to Mommy, it&#8217;s not going to happen anytime soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother of four also got emotional discussing her future once she&#8217;s released from custody.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m relieved that my kids and my family can just kind of move forward, and I&#8217;m relieved that I can move forward,&#8221; Brittany said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s still really hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brittany, who faced up to life in prison if convicted, said she decided to take the plea deal after her attorneys told her they couldn&#8217;t guarantee a victory at trial.</p>
<p>She had previously asked a judge to grant her immunity under the state&#8217;s Stand Your Ground self-defense law, but the court agreed with a prosecutor who said Brittany did not prove the killing was legally justified and set the case for trial.</p>
<p>&#8220;They knew that it wasn&#8217;t going to be fair here either,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I just took the lesser of the options I had.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>But Brittany said she&#8217;s now focusing on possibly getting a pardon one day and wants to write a book detailing her ordeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is gonna be in my past soon,&#8221; she told AL.com. &#8220;It&#8217;s gonna be behind me. It&#8217;s a good feeling. After the rough waters, smooth sailing.&#8221;</p>

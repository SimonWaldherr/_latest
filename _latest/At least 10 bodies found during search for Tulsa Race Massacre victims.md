<div><p>At least 10 bodies have been found in an unmarked mass grave at a Tulsa cemetery where investigators are searching for remains of victims of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/19/tulsa-oklahoma-white-supremacist-massacre-trump-rally" class="u-underline">1921 Tulsa Race Massacre</a>, a state official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we were finding was an indication that we were inside a large area &#8230; a large hole that had been excavated and into which several individuals had been placed and buried in that location. This constitutes a mass grave,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oklahoma" class="u-underline">Oklahoma</a> state archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck.</p>
<p>Ten coffins were discovered with what is presumed to be one person in each coffin, Stackelbeck said. She said further examination was needed.</p>
<p>Forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield, a descendant of a survivor of the massacre who is assisting in the search, said it would take considerable time to identify the remains and determine whether they were victims of the massacre.</p>
<p>The search began on Monday and is the second this year after an unsuccessful search in another area of Oaklawn cemetery ended in July.</p>
<p>Tulsa&#8217;s mayor, GT Bynum, who first proposed looking for victims of the violence in 2018 and later budgeted $100,000 to fund it after previous searches failed to find victims has said efforts will be made to find any descendants of the victims who are identified.</p>

<p>Oaklawn cemetery in north Tulsa is near the Greenwood district where the massacre took place.</p>
<p>The violence took place on 31 May and 1 June in 1921, when a white mob attacked Tulsa&#8217;s Black Wall Street, killing an estimated 300, mostly Black, people and wounding 800 more while robbing and burning businesses, homes and churches.</p>
<p>The massacre &#8211; which happened two years after what is known as the &#8220;Red Summer&#8221;, when hundreds of African Americans died at the hands of white mobs in violence around the US &#8211; has been depicted in recent HBO shows Watchmen and Lovecraft County.</p>

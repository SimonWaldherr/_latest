  (CNN) With Afghan peace talks underway, those seeking to undermine the process are targeting Afghan women in hopes of derailing it.The US embassy in Afghanistan warned last month that extremist organizations are planning attacks that take direct aim at women, including teachers, government workers, and human-rights activists.The threats underscore how central Afghan women's rights are to the success of the Afghan peace process and to the country's future.Many criticize the US government for failing to secure more from the Taliban in its initial deal -- including any guarantees for Afghan women, despite years of bipartisan promises to protect Afghan women's rights.And many Afghan women fear that in this mix of contentious priorities, their rights could be traded for a chance at ending the conflict.

  An Earthquake, an Orphanage, and New Beginnings for Haitian Children in America 
description: > 
  Judge Barrett’s son, also named John Peter and then about 3 years old, was on that flight out of Haiti following the earthquake.He and his sister, Vivian, who was adopted from the same orphanage more than five years earlier, form a key part of the Barretts’ family story.Detractors have criticized as “white saviorism” the judge’s public accounts of her children’s dire situations before they left Haiti.A small group of families who adopted children from the same orphanage, some at the very same time, are asking more intimate questions.Though she doesn’t agree with Judge Barrett’s political positions, nor with the timing of her nomination, she’d love to hear what the past decade has been like for the family.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Judge Barrett&#8217;s son, also named John Peter and then about 3 years old, was on that flight out of Haiti following the earthquake. He and his sister, Vivian, who was adopted from the same orphanage more than five years earlier, form a key part of the Barretts&#8217; family story.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Judge Barrett has talked about their adoptions regularly in public speeches. She was inspired to adopt, she once explained, because <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">&#8220;</strong>there are so many children in need.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Just as everything with her nomination, the adoptions have been hard to totally separate from the politics of the moment.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Some critics have noted the irony of a president who has worked to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/us/immigrants-temporary-protected-status.html" title="">close the United States </a>to disaster refugees and once <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/trump-shithole-countries.html" title="">referred to Haiti with an expletive</a> lauding the Barretts&#8217; adoptions.And the ongoing debate over international adoption has played out as well. Advocates hope the Barretts&#8217; story will encourage other prospective parents to come forward. Detractors have criticized as &#8220;white saviorism&#8221; the judge&#8217;s public accounts of her children&#8217;s dire situations before they left Haiti.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">A small group of families who adopted children from the same orphanage, some at the very same time, are asking more intimate questions.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;I&#8217;d be really interested to hear how the kids are,&#8221; said Cara Leadingham, a mother of 11 from Illinois who remembers holding &#8220;Little&#8221; John Peter during many visits to the orphanage while waiting for the adoption of her daughter to be finalized. Though she doesn&#8217;t agree with Judge Barrett&#8217;s political positions, nor with the timing of her nomination, she&#8217;d love to hear what the past decade has been like for the family.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;There are success stories and equally as many challenging stories,&#8221; said Ms. Leadingham.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Inspired to adopt by a couple they met in their marriage preparation course, Judge Barrett has said they chose Haiti because of its overwhelming poverty and proximity to the United States, so &#8220;we could go as a family and be involved in Haiti as the children got older.&#8221;</p></div>

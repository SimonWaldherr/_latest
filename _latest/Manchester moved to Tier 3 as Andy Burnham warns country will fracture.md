<p>Manchester will move into Tier 3 without any additional business support money from central Government, the Prime Minister has suggested.</p>
<p>Tier 3 lockdown means many businesses in Manchester will now have to close, while households cannot mix.</p>
<p>The move comes as coronavirus rates continue to spike in the area, and could reach the level of the city's peak in April in two weeks if the rate is now slowed.</p>
<p>But speaking live from Downing Street, fresh from an almighty row with Andy Burnham, Mr Johnson said it would be unfair to give Manchester a &#163;65m funding package that was "out of kilter" with other regions that have received support.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons on Tuesday night Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said the Government's "door [was] open" to more negotiation on Manchester's funding settlement. The &#163;60m offer is still on the table, he said.</p>
<p>Jon Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, accused the Government of a "petty, vindictive, callous response in a national crisis".</p>

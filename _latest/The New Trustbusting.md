<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">If it is, yesterday could represent the start of that era. The Justice Department <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html" title="">filed a lawsuit against Google</a>, accusing it of holding an illegal monopoly over internet search and search advertising. State officials are investigating the company as well, and both federal and state officials are also scrutinizing Facebook, Amazon and some other large companies.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The common thread in these investigations is a concern that big companies have become so powerful that they&#8217;re bad for the country. They can distort government policy through lobbyists, lawyers and campaign donations. The companies <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/opinion/monopsony-rigidity-and-the-wage-puzzle-wonkish.html" title="">can hold down wages</a>, because workers don&#8217;t always have good employment alternatives. And the companies often <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-ad-market-regulated-like-stock-market/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">squash</a>, or buy, any competitors that threaten their position.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Google is different from past behemoths in that it does not charge money for many of its products (like web search). But there is still reason to worry about its dominance. Its control over web search means it can charge high prices for ads, a particular problem for small businesses. It can also hurt consumers by cluttering its search results with ads, knowing users can&#8217;t easily use a rival search engine.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Washington Post&#8217;s Geoffrey Fowler ran a clever experiment this week, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comparing the quality of Google searches in 2020 and 2000</a>. His conclusion: &#8220;Google increasingly fails us.&#8221; As Tim Wu, an antitrust expert, told me yesterday, &#8220;A secure monopoly doesn&#8217;t have to improve its product.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Google <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disputes these criticisms</a>, saying people use it &#8220;because they choose to, not because they&#8217;re forced to.&#8221; Pierre Lemieux, an economist, has previously argued that antitrust action against Google <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2015/Lemieuxgoogle.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is unnecessary</a> because internet dominance is often temporary.</p></div>

What is the Nissan Leaf like?

There’s a good reason the Nissan Leaf was, for a time, the best-selling electric car (EV) in the UK. Until fairly recently, it was the only car that combined battery-electric power with a comparatively affordable price and a body that was big enough to serve as everyday transport for the majority of British families.

That you can now buy one for as little as £5,000 makes it particularly interesting – especially if your driving is mostly urban, or your need to travel longer distances is minimal.

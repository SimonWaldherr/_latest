The UFC Fight Island 6 card has taken a major hit.

The heavyweight co-main event pitting highly touted prospect Ciryl Gane and UFC newcomer Ante Delija has been scrapped from the card just a few days away from the event.

UFC officials confirmed the news to MMA Fighting on Wednesday following an initial report from Lasueur.com.

According to UFC officials, the issues were ultimately in regards to Delija’s contract status after he inked a deal with the UFC on short notice to accept the fight against Gane.

Gane was originally scheduled to meet Shamil Abdurakhimov but he was forced off the card due to undisclosed reasons with Delija replacing him in the fight.

Unfortunately with quarantine protocols and travel issues, there’s no time to find a replacement opponent to face Gane with Delija off the card.

Since first arriving in the UFC, Gane has been considered one of the brightest prospects in the heavyweight division. He’s currently undefeated in his career including three straight wins in the UFC.

With Gane vs. Delija cancelled, the new co-main event for the card will be the flyweight showdown between Katlyn Chookagian and Jessica Andrade.

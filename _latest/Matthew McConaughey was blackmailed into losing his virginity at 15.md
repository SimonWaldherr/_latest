<p>&#8220;I was blackmailed into having sex for the first time when I was 15,&#8221; the 50-year-old actor wrote in his newly autobiography, &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Q95D0EP9URDG&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=greenlights+matthew+mcconaughey&amp;qid=1603294101&amp;sprefix=greenlights%2Caps%2C239&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=pagesix-20">Greenlights</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was certain I was going to hell for the premarital sex. Today, I am merely certain that I hope that&#8217;s not the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Oscar winner also revealed that he was &#8220;molested by a man when I was eighteen while knocked unconscious in the back of a van.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t give details about either case of abuse. However, he says he&#8217;s never felt like a victim, as &#8220;I have a lot of proof that the world is conspiring to make me happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The married father of three also details his parents&#8217; tempestuous marriage. They were married thrice, divorced twice, and had arguments that resulted in broken bones.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Dallas Buyers Club&#8221; star wrote that his father, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/17/matthew-mcconaughey-reveals-his-dad-died-while-makin-love-to-his-mother/">James, died</a> immediately after making love to the actor&#8217;s mother in 1992.</p>

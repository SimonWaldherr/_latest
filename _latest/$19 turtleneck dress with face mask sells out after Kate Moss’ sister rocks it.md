Kate Moss’ little sis is up to her nose in style.

Lottie Moss, the 22-year-old younger half-sibling to the famed ’90s supermodel, was spotted in a sexy two-in-one getup that combines a turtleneck dress and face mask.

The long-sleeved bodycon dress Moss rocked on the streets of London, from UK-based retailer Pretty Little Thing, sports fabric that extends part way up her face and serves as a mask thanks to loops tucked around the ears.

Pretty Little Thing sold out of the £15 (or $19.31) dress after Moss stepped out, but it’s now back in stock with limited supply. On its website, the brand describes its assets, “featuring a black jersey material with long sleeves, a figure-hugging fit and a mask detail.”

Brands closer to home are also embracing the all-in-one garment: Brooklyn-based lifestyle label Tribes of Kin is also currently touting a curve-hugging COVID Turtle Mask Dress in black and royal blue for $199 a pop.

“[These] TURTLE MASK DRESSES AKA COVID DRESSES are long sleeves, ankle length, made with cotton knit with the turtle neck part long enough to double as face mask/covering,” wrote Cameroonian brand creator Mia Anyinke in the caption of an Instagram photo promoting the items.

“The turtle mask dress came about in the middle of quarantine one afternoon when I forgot my mask at home and had to turn around to go all the way back to get my face covering,” she told The Post. “I said to myself why not just design a dress with the neck part long enough to double as a mask/face covering.”

They may look snazzy, but be warned: these dress-masks may not serve as the best barrier against the coronavirus. In an August study ranking 14 different types of masks, Duke University researchers found that ones made out of cotton were significantly less protective than surgical masks or the gold standard of an N95.

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has caused a face mask renaissance, with fashion labels rising to the challenge of creating coverings that not only protect wearers from COVID-19 but look cute, too.

Matching a mask to a dress of the same pattern (or, in warmer temps, to a bathing suit) is already de rigueur, but the dress-mask has elevated the face covering from necessary accessory to built-in asset.

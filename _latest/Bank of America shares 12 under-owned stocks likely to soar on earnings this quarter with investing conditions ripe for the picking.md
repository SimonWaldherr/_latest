<p>With 18% of the S&amp;P 500 companies reporting this week, third-quarter earnings season is ramping up and in full swing, according to Bank of America's earnings tracker.&#160;</p><p>Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America, sees a bright quarter ahead for corporate America.</p><p>Subramanian and her team took into consideration eight different factors including:</p><ul><li>(1) the economic surprise index</li><li>(2) the relationship between GDP and EPS</li><li>(3) dispersion of estimates</li><li>(4) top-down EPS forecasts</li><li>(5) the average post-Regulation Fair Disclosure third-quarter beat</li><li>(6) Bank of America analyst forecasts for the quarter</li><li>(7) the average beat when estimates rose into earnings, and</li><li>(8) early reporters' 11% plus average beat</li></ul><p>Their conclusion is a 5% upside surprise for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 this quarter.&#160;</p><p>"With better macro data and strong results from early reporters, we forecast a solid beat this quarter of 5% or $34.50 (-18% YoY). A 46% bounce in average oil prices from 2Q, strong consumption and manufacturing trends, and a weakening USD all point to a healthy recovery in earnings in 3Q," she wrote in a research note on October 12.</p><p>However, the reduced benefits of stimulus and a surge in COVID cases spell a more cautious outlook going forward, she said, noting that current consensus points to earnings improving to -14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.&#160;</p><h2>What to buy, what to sell&#160;</h2><p>Despite the overall negative earnings growth, there are still opportunities for investors to net positive gains.&#160;</p>

<p>The team looked into EPS revisions, sales revisions, and guidance as well as the ratio of positive to negative surprises in the previous quarter for 11 sectors.&#160;</p><p>The end result, which is displayed in the chart below, suggests that investors own consumer staples and healthcare while avoiding utilities and energy stocks in the third quarter.&#160;</p><p>

</p><p>Subramanian also points out that the earnings season marks a good time for stock picking.&#160;</p><p>"For short-term investors, stock differentiation is heightened during earnings season, particularly the busiest reporting days," she said in the note. "This quarter, the busiest days fall the last week of October."</p><p>As such, the team screened the S&amp;P 500 for stocks under the bank's coverage that are most likely to beat or miss earnings expectations.&#160;</p><p>It factored in Bank of America's EPS and sales estimates versus consensus estimates, last quarter's results, and fundamental opinions from BofA analysts.</p><p>To further refine the screen, the team flagged stocks expected to beat earnings but are underweight by active fund managers.&#160;<a href="https://rsch.baml.com/r?q=Uy!QYFozGI9sqLyptoWMIg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p><p>The 12 stocks are listed below in increasing order of active fund ownership.&#160;</p>

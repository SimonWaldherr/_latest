Barrett is expected to be approved by Republicans who hold the majority on the panel, with Democrats saying they will boycott the day's proceedings. The full Senate is expected to take a&#160;final vote on Barrett's confirmation on Monday, eight days before Election Day.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Democrats said they would boycott Thursday's hearing and vote, hoping to prevent the committee from establishing a quorum. Instead, Democrats plan to hold a press conference Thursday morning during the hearing. The boycott effort appeared to be a longshot&#160;attempt at stalling&#160;the federal judge's&#160;confirmation to the high court but Republicans vowed to move forward, with or without Democrats present.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Sen. Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the panel would vote regardless. "Judge Barrett deserves a vote and she will receive a vote," he said, adding, "As to my Democratic colleagues&#8217; refusal to attend the markup, that is a choice they are making. I believe it does a disservice to Judge Barrett who deserves a vote, up or down."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Senate Judiciary Committee's rules outline that at least nine members of the majority (Republicans) and at least two members of the minority (Democrats) need to be present to conduct business.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While Democrats boycotting the hearing would technically mean the committee's rules would bar Republicans from moving forward on Barrett's nomination, it's likely not to stop the process.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">The path forward:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/15/amy-coney-barrett-what-happens-next-her-confirmation-process/3664102001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Amy Coney Barrett hearings conclude: Here's what happens next in Supreme Court confirmation</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">No drama?:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/17/amy-coney-barrett-civil-hearings-were-contrast-brett-kavanaugh/3677741001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court hearings lacked the drama that Brett Kavanaugh's proceedings had.

While liberals have harshly criticized the process and Barrett's appointment in the midst of Americans voting in a presidential election, Democrats have acknowledged they don't have the power to halt her confirmation.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Only two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, have voiced opposition to filling the vacancy on the court left by Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death before the election. Two other Republicans would have to join with Democrats in order to halt what appears to be Barrett's inevitable confirmation to the Supreme Court.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While Democrats cannot stop her nomination, they have employed a host of procedural maneuvers to attempt to slow it down.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The vote Thursday follows four days of hearings last week, where senators peppered Barrett with questions for hours about a host of issues that could&#160;come before the high court, including the Affordable Care Act, abortion, voting rights and climate change.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/politics/2020/10/13/amy-coney-barrett-testifies-during-senate-confirmation-hearings/5978414002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">During the hearings:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/13/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-nominee-strives-show-independence/3638652001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett strives to show independence from White House, Republicans</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">How Barrett could shift the court:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/27/amy-coney-barrett-how-supreme-court-could-change-6-conservatives/3536634001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Six conservative justices? 10 ways the Supreme Court could change</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Barrett&#160;dodged answering many inquiries that dealt with contentious issues, frustrating Democrats who were eager to derail her confirmation, while vowing to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/13/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-nominee-strives-show-independence/3638652001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">keep an open mind </a>on any issue that comes before her on the court.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Since Ginsburg died in September, both sides have fought over how to go about replacing her on the court. Republicans have sought to&#160;confirm&#160;a new justice by Election Day in an effort to add one more conservative justice to the court before a contentious election. Democrats, hoping Joe Biden defeats Trump and they regain control of the Senate, have said the outcome of the election should determine who gets to choose a new Supreme Court justice.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If Barrett is confirmed, there would be&#160;a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court.</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p></div>

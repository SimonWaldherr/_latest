  White House pushes $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus despite tepid support from Republicans 
description: > 
  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who’s working closely with Pelosi in the stimulus talks, took aim at the GOP’s Wednesday attempt to advance a slim bill, describing it as a stunt designed to fail so that McConnell could blame Democrats and get a time-consuming legislative effort out of the way ahead of next week’s expected confirmation vote on Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.

<p>Japanese researchers have shown that masks can offer protection from airborne&#160;coronavirus&#160;particles, but even professional-grade coverings cannot eliminate contagion risk entirely.</p>
<p>Scientists at the University of Tokyo built a secure chamber with mannequin heads facing each other. One head, fitted with a nebuliser, simulated coughing and expelled actual&#160;coronavirus&#160;particles. The other mimicked natural breathing, with a collection chamber for viruses coming through the airway.</p>

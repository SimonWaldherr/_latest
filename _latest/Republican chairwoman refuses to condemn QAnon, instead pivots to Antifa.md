I knew it because it's something the voters are not even thinking about. It's a fringe group. It&#8217;s not part of our party. The vice president said: &#8216;I dismiss it out of hand&#8217;. The president said: &#8216;You know what, I don't know anything about this group&#8217;. But, of course, you&#8217;re going to ask me about that because it has absolutely nothing to do with this election.&#8221;</p><p></p><p>&#8220;So do you condemn it?&#8221; asked Mr Stephanopoulos.</p><p>&#8220;Antifa &#8212; Antifa is burning down cities right now,&#8221; she began. &#8220;I just told you, dismiss them out of hand.

Similarly troubling is their silence regarding anti-vaxxers, militias, and anarchists.&#8221;</p><p class="sc-ptCms fzKffT"></p></div>

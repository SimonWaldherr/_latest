Rihanna is showing big love for plus-size models.

The Barbadian songstress, 32, is once again reaping praise on social media for employing plus-size male models for the Savage X Fenty capsule collection drop.

On Friday, one fan shared an eye-full of hardly dressed hunks spotted on SavageX.com.

“OKAY RIHANNA,” the fan wrote on Twitter, adding a side-eyes emoji at the end. Since Friday morning, the tweet has already garnered more than 198,000 likes and over 25,000 retweets — proving even shout-outs for the beloved celebrity mogul have viral potential.

Many of the top-rated replies are rather risqué in their appreciation of “big boys,” but it’s clear that RiRi’s fans feel seen.

“Never in my adult life have I seen a male model that has a similar body to mine,” said @codyjacobmusic. “I feel . . . almost emotional? Like I finally can buy something I saw and want and KNOW it was made for people like me in mind.”

“She just proves that these other brands are pretentious and discriminatory for NO REASON,” added @chidi_x6x, suggesting that inclusivity is also good for business.

The move is on-brand for the Fenty fashion house, whose continued campaign for inclusivity has been a viral headline mainstay since their launch in 2017, when they began featuring curvy physiques in their campaigns and in-store displays.

It’s not just about body positivity. Fenty Beauty’s flagship foundation was lauded for its comprehensive range of 40 shades. And earlier this year they introduced a “gender-neutral” skin care line, marketed to men, women and nonbinary people together.

On Friday, Savage X Fenty’s “Vol. 2” fashion show — a scantily clad spectacle to rival over 20 years of Victoria’s Secret fashion shows — dropped on Amazon Prime Video, and fans are already applauding her multi-cultural cast of models.

About this data The hot spots map shows the share of population with a new reported case over the last week. Data for the West Bank and Gaza was reported together by the Palestinian Health Ministry and includes only Palestinian-controlled land. Russia is reporting data for Crimea, a peninsula it annexed in 2014 in a move that led to international sanctions. Data for some countries, like the United States and France, include counts for overseas territories. Japan’s count includes 696 cases and seven deaths from a cruise ship that docked in Yokohama.

The coronavirus pandemic is ebbing in some of the countries that were hit hard early on, but the number of new cases is growing faster than ever worldwide, with more than 200,000 reported each day on average.

The virus continues to affect every region of the world, but some countries are experiencing high rates of infection, while others appear to have mostly controlled the virus.

The outbreak was initially defined by a series of shifting epicenters — including Wuhan, China; Iran; northern Italy; Spain; and New York.

Cases worldwide leveled off in April after social distancing measures were put in place in many of the areas with early outbreaks.

But as countries began to reopen in May and June, the United States was unable to contain a resurgence of the disease, making it one of the main drivers of rising case numbers around the world. Many South American countries are also experiencing high rates of infection, with Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru reporting large numbers of cases every day. And European countries that had severe early outbreaks are seeing a second rise in cases.

The New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

After case numbers fell steadily in April and May, cases in the United States are growing again at about the same rapid pace as when infections were exploding in New York City in late March. But the hotspots are now mainly spread across the southern and western parts of the country.

The New York Times is engaged in an effort to track the details of every reported case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The Times has made that data public in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones.

Although it is one of countless books written on bushido (&#8216;the way of the warrior&#8217;), Nitobe&#8217;s book remains the most influential source for those seeking to understand a value system that continues to permeate many facets of Japanese society to this day.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>How to be good</strong></p>

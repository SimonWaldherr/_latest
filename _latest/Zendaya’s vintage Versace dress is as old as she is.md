Zendaya is the queen of the virtual red carpet.

The “Euphoria” actress was one of the fashion favorites at last month’s Emmys — and now, the 24-year-old is delivering another knockout look.

On Saturday, she appeared remotely at the 2020 Green Carpet Fashion Awards to accept the Visionary Award, wearing a vintage Versace dress from 1996 — the same year the former Disney star was born.

“This is an incredible honor, it means the world to me,” Zendaya said, per E! News.

“I think fashion has always truly lived in my heart ever since I was very, very young. I love clothes and I think it’s so much more than just clothes. I think it’s art, it’s emotion, it’s feeling, and to me, through clothes, I’ve been able to find myself and be more confident in myself … growing into my womanhood.”

Longtime stylist Law Roach explained the inspiration behind the look to British Vogue, revealing he looked to ’90s supermodels.

“[Zendaya] was actually born in 1996, so I thought that it’d be fun [for her] to wear something from that year,” he said. “It’s taking her back — if Zendaya had been of age then, maybe she would have been a Versace model.”

The look was completed with Christian Louboutin heels from Zendaya’s closet.

“People forget that vintage is sustainable; it’s a way to reduce waste,” Roach continued. “And there’s always a story: who’s worn it before, who made it, what did it mean to them, where did you find it? That part of fashion has always intrigued me, and brings more life to whatever you’re wearing.”

Indeed, one of the style’s previous models, Naomi Campbell, was delighted to see the brown version resurface.

“Beautiful!! Remember this dress and collection well,” Campbell said, recalling the yellow version of the same design she wore on the runway in 1996.

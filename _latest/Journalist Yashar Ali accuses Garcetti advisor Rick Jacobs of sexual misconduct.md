<p>Greg Smith, Garza&#8217;s attorney, said in a statement Monday night that &#8221;every person should feel free from fear and intimidation when reporting sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. &#8221; Smith said he believes more people will come forward.</p><p>Jacobs, along with the mayor&#8217;s wife, Amy Wakeland, are widely seen as Garcetti&#8217;s closest advisors.</p><p>Jacobs helped raise money for a committee that supported Garcetti&#8217;s 2013 mayoral run and the mayor rewarded him with a top post at City Hall. </p><p>Today, Jacobs serves on the board of directors of the Mayor&#8217;s Fund for Los Angeles, a nonprofit that raises money for Garcetti-backed causes.

Jacobs denied making the threat.</p><p>Garcetti has publicly stood by Jacobs since Garza&#8217;s lawsuit was filed. The mayor in August called Jacobs &#8220;a committed public servant&#8221; and said he should be able to continue to work for the Mayor&#8217;s Fund and the other nonprofit while the case is being litigated.</p><p><i>Times staff writer Richard Winton contributed to this report.</i></p></div>

<p>E-commerce has grown massively in the last several months as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered brick-and-mortar retail and pushed spending online.&#160;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buy-now-pay-later-growth-timeline-fintechs-affirm-klarna-paypal-2020-9">Buy now, pay later</a>, too, has seen a boost as more consumers turn to installment payments when they check out online.</p><p>Sweden's Klarna, one of the larger buy now, pay later fintechs, has been on a tear.

<h2>To stand apart, Klarna is investing in its brand</h2><p>Buy now, pay later is a crowded space. From fintechs like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-affirm-partner-buy-now-pay-later-installments-online-shopping-2020-7">Affirm</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/afterpay-goes-in-store-in-us-business-insider-2020-7">Afterpay</a> to incumbents like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-buy-now-pay-later-installment-launch-2020-9">PayPal</a>, Klarna isn't the only one banking on consumers' interest in installment payments. To compete, Klarna is trying to build a consumer-facing brand all its own.</p><p>"There are a lot of buttons in the checkout. I just want to be the most popular," Siemiatkowski said. "Everything we can come up with that makes consumers want to choose us because they feel we provide more value, let's do it."</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/klarna-fundraise-650-million-10-billion-2020-9">Swedish fintech Klarna is Europe's latest decacorn startup after raising $650 million at a $10.65 billion valuation</a></p><p>And that means investing in its app and features beyond installment payments to create consumer stickiness.

<p>Even before the coronavirus pandemic, retailers were building omnichannel platforms, connecting online and in-store experiences.

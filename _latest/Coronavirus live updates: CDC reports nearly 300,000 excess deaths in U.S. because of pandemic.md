  Seven months into the global pandemic, Sweden had its first taste of local restrictions Tuesday after a city north of Stockholm imposed new recommendations following a surge in coronavirus cases there.Residents of Uppsala have been “strongly advised” to avoid public transportation, physical contact with those they don’t live with and parties or other social gatherings, according to the Local.Sweden has confirmed more than 106,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 6,000 covid-19 related deaths.But unlike most other countries, the Scandinavian nation has avoided imposing some form of lockdown or major shutdown of schools or businesses.Last week, Sweden’s public health agency announced a change in policy that enables regional health authorities to impose restrictions aimed at localized outbreaks.

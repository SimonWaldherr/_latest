Parents with young children may be protected against severe Covid-19 symptoms because their immune systems are boosted by regularly catching coughs and colds, a study has found.

A team of scientists believes exposure to seasonal coronaviruses from the same family as Covid-19, like the common cold, may prevent people falling seriously ill or requiring hospitalisation if they catch it.

The academics have called for more research to be carried out to try to establish whether primary school and nursery teachers, as well as parents, are benefiting from young children acting as “natural vaccine boosters”.

This latest study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, gathered data from more than 300,000 Scottish households containing a healthcare worker to see whether those living with children under the age of 11 were offered some protection from the virus.

Summarising their results, the authors, led by Dr David McAllister, a senior clinical lecturer in public health at Glasgow University, wrote: “The risk of hospitalisation with Covid-19 was lower in those with one child, and lower still in those with two or more children.”

The report concludes: “Increased household exposure to young children was associated with an attenuated risk of testing positive for Sars-Cov-2 and appeared to also be associated with an attenuated risk of Covid-19 disease severe enough to require hospitalisation.”

They add: “These findings have potentially important implications for future controls of the Covid-19 pandemic, for example through informing policy on nursery and school closure and vaccination.”

  Inspired by Trump, Hasidic Backlash Grows Over Virus Rules 
description: > 
  A group of mostly young men began descending on the Brooklyn home of a Hasidic journalist just before midnight on Sunday.The men, who were fellow ultra-Orthodox Jews, were shouting that the journalist, Jacob Kornbluh, was a snitch, an informer who had betrayed his own by publishing reports on how devoutly religious Jews in the city had been ignoring coronavirus guidelines.The group got all the way to Mr. Kornbluh’s doorstep, where a line of police officers kept them at bay.The tense scene spoke to what many Orthodox leaders said they had been seeing for weeks: a growing, raucous faction of young men in the community, tired of pandemic guidelines and resentful of the secular authorities, who are taking their cues from the broader right-wing movement in society, including from President Trump.

A group of mostly young men began descending on the Brooklyn home of a Hasidic journalist just before midnight on Sunday.

The men, who were fellow ultra-Orthodox Jews, were shouting that the journalist, Jacob Kornbluh, was a snitch, an informer who had betrayed his own by publishing reports on how devoutly religious Jews in the city had been ignoring coronavirus guidelines.

The group got all the way to Mr. Kornbluh’s doorstep, where a line of police officers kept them at bay.

The tense scene spoke to what many Orthodox leaders said they had been seeing for weeks: a growing, raucous faction of young men in the community, tired of pandemic guidelines and resentful of the secular authorities, who are taking their cues from the broader right-wing movement in society, including from President Trump.

  2020 Live Election Updates: Obama, Biden’s Not-So-Secret Weapon, Will Hit the Campaign Trail 
description: > 
  ET 2020 Live Election Updates: Obama, Biden’s Not-So-Secret Weapon, Will Hit the Campaign Trail The former president will campaign for Joe Biden today in Philadelphia as President Trump holds a rally in North Carolina.A man in Maryland was charged with threatening to kill Mr. Biden and Kamala Harris.For the next two weeks, he will make the case for Mr. Biden in the flesh.For most of Mr. Trump’s term, Mr. Obama refrained from criticizing his successor, even as Mr. Trump worked to systematically demolish many of Mr. Obama’s achievements.It’s an indication that Mr. Biden could pull off a landslide in November, achieving an ambitious and rare electoral blowout that some Democrats think is necessary to quell any doubts — or disputes by Mr. Trump — that Mr. Biden won the election.

<p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Barack Obama carried Iowa twice, but the state swung decisively to Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/iowa" title="">in 2016</a>. But as in other Midwestern states, Mr. Trump&#8217;s incendiary conduct has alienated many voters. The president is viewed unfavorably by more than half of likely Iowa voters, and very unfavorably by over half of women and college-educated voters there.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Another survey of Iowa, released Wednesday by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_IA_102120/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monmouth University</a>, found Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump by 50 to 47 percent among likely voters there. Mr. Biden&#8217;s edge, which is within the poll&#8217;s margin of error, was calculated using a high-turnout scenario that most observers say is already playing out in early voting and absentee balloting.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It also represents a dramatic shift in just the last month: In September, Monmouth found Mr. Trump leading by a 49-to-46 percent margin using the same voter model.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Monmouth poll found Ms. Greenfield narrowly leading Ms. Ernst, by a 49-to-47 percent margin, which was also within the poll&#8217;s 4.4 percent margin of error.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-martin" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Jonathan Martin</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-man-in-maryland-was-arrested-and-charged-with-threatening-to-kidnap-and-kill-biden-and-harris"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-man-in-maryland-was-arrested-and-charged-with-threatening-to-kidnap-and-kill-biden-and-harris">A man in Maryland was arrested and charged with threatening to kidnap and kill Biden and Harris.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A man in Maryland was accused on Wednesday of threatening the lives of Joseph R.

Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A criminal complaint filed by the Secret Service on Wednesday did not describe any steps taken by the man, identified as James Dale Reed, to carry out the alleged threat. It said that on Oct. 4, Mr. Reed approached a house in his hometown, Frederick, Md., northwest of Washington, that had Biden-Harris campaign signs in the yard and left a handwritten note that contained graphic threats against the candidates and their supporters. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The resident&#8217;s video doorbell had captured an image of the man who left the note, the complaint said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We are the ones with these scary guns, we are the ones your children have nightmares about,&#8221; the note read in part. Mr. Reed, 42, was arrested last Friday and is being held without bond in Frederick County, Md., according to court records. A spokeswoman for the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, which is representing Mr. Reed, declined to comment. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He provided a palm print and handwriting sample and acknowledged having written the letter, according to the complaint. He is charged with the federal offense of threatening a major candidate, which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, and two violations of state law: threatening mass violence and voter intimidation.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"> The complaint said that Mr. Reed was known to law enforcement for making a complaint against a person under Secret Service protection in 2014.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Death threats against the United States president and presidential candidates are not uncommon in election years.

That he is campaigning in what should be a safely Republican state &#8212; and in others that were expected to be solidly in his column, like Iowa and Ohio &#8212; is evidence to many Democrats that Joseph R. Biden Jr.&#8217;s polling lead in the presidential race is solid and durable. Mr. Trump spent Monday in Arizona, too, a state that was once reliably Republican but where his unpopularity has helped make Mr. Biden competitive.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For some Democrats, Mr. Trump&#8217;s attention to red states is also a sign of something else &#8212; something few in the party want to discuss out loud, given their scars from Mr. Trump&#8217;s surprise victory in 2016. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/biden-election-landslide.html" title="">It&#8217;s an indication that Mr. Biden could pull off a landslide</a> in November, achieving an ambitious and rare electoral blowout that some Democrats think is necessary to quell any doubts &#8212; or disputes by Mr. Trump &#8212; that Mr. Biden won the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On one level, such a scenario is entirely plausible based on the weeks and the breadth of public polls that show Mr. Biden with leads or narrow edges in key states. But this possibility runs headlong into the political difficulties of pulling off such a win, and perhaps even more, the psychological hurdles for Democrats to entertain the idea. Many think that Mr. Trump, having pulled off a stunning win before, could do it again, even if there are differences from 2016 that hurt his chances.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">This much is clear: Landslide presidential victories have become rare &#8212; the last big one was in 1988, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/world/americas/07iht-07elect.17608839.html" title="">a more modest one in 2008</a> &#8212; and Mr. Trump is still ahead of or running closely with Mr. Biden in many of the states he won in 2016 when the margin of error is factored in.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats see flipping states like Texas and Georgia as key to a possible landslide; Texas hasn&#8217;t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976, and Georgia since 1992.

But we want better, we want change in our community. We always talk about, &#8216;We want change,&#8217; and now we have the opportunity to do that.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">More Than a Vote&#8217;s latest partnership, a collaboration with the political organization Win Black, will seek to fight the spread of misinformation with voter education campaigns that are headlined by athletes and celebrities and amplified through Snapchat. The announcement came on the same day the group announced new investments in groups that register formerly incarcerated persons in Michigan, Florida, and North Carolina.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. James, who campaigned on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016, said has been focused more on issues than candidates in this cycle &#8212; less a political decision than a strategy dictated by the rapid pace of events.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been talking about voter suppression, we&#8217;ve been talking about police brutality, systemic racism,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had so many things going on, and voter suppression in our communities happens to be at the forefront. So that&#8217;s something we wanted to educate our people on.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The rapid-response initiative will seek to educate younger Black voters on how to spot false political statements spreading on social media. The goal is to provide advice that culminates in young people making a plan to vote &#8212; either by absentee ballot or in person.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Called &#8220;Under Review,&#8221; the effort will be featured on Snapchat through Election Day, and will include videos from celebrities and activists like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/magazine/how-desus-mero-conquered-late-night.html" title="">Desus and Mero</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/sports/jemele-hill-the-atlantic-.html" title="">Jemele Hill</a> and the athletes involved in More Than a Vote.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We believe that Black people, our community, we&#8217;ve been pushed away from our civic duty. We&#8217;ve been fed misinformation for many years,&#8221; added Mr. James, who said his goal is to get young more Black people to the polls.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You know, there&#8217;s so many stats out there, you can see it every time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Who didn&#8217;t vote? What counties didn&#8217;t vote? What communities didn&#8217;t vote? And a lot of that has had to do with our Black people. So, hopefully, we can get them out and educated and let them understand how important this moment is.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/astead-w-herndon" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="voters-in-florida-and-alaska-received-threatening-vote-for-trump-emails"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#voters-in-florida-and-alaska-received-threatening-vote-for-trump-emails">Voters in Florida and Alaska received threatening &#8216;vote for Trump&#8217; emails.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Florida began in-person early voting in much of the state Monday.&#160;The state is a hotly contested battleground in the presidential race." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/us/20elections-brief-florida/20elections-brief-florida-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Florida began in-person early voting in much of the state Monday.&#160;The state is a hotly contested battleground in the presidential race.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Lynne Sladky/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">People in Florida and Alaska reported receiving <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/florida-alaska-trump-emails.html" title="">menacing and deceptive emails on Tuesday</a> that used false claims about public voting information to threaten voters: &#8220;Vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.&#8221; (There is no way for any group to know for whom individual voters cast their ballots.)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">One of the emails, obtained by The New York Times, came from an address that suggested an affiliation with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/us/proud-boys-trump.html" title="">the Proud Boys</a>, a far-right group.

Biden Jr. as soft on China, in part by pointing to his son&#8217;s business dealings there.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Mr. Trump&#8217;s own business history is filled with overseas financial deals, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/trump-taxes-china.html" title="">some have involved the Chinese state</a>. He spent a decade unsuccessfully pursuing projects in China, operating an office there during his first run for president and forging a partnership with a major government-controlled company.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And it turns out that China is one of only three foreign nations &#8212; the others are Britain and Ireland &#8212; where Mr. Trump maintains a bank account, according to an analysis of the president&#8217;s tax records, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html" title="">which were obtained by The New York Times</a>. The foreign accounts do not show up on Mr. Trump&#8217;s public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names. The identities of the financial institutions are not clear.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management L.L.C., which the tax records show paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The tax records do not include details on how much money may have passed through the overseas accounts, though the I.R.S. does require filers to report the portion of their income derived from other countries. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In response to questions from The Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said the company had &#8220;opened an account with a Chinese bank having offices in the United States in order to pay the local taxes&#8221; associated with efforts to do business there. He said the company had opened the account after establishing an office in China &#8220;to explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialized and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,&#8221; Mr. Garten said. &#8220;Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Garten would not identify the bank in China where the account is held.

His campaign has tried to portray Mr. Biden as a &#8220;puppet&#8221; of China who, as vice president, misread the dangers posed by its growing power. Mr. Trump has also sought to tar his opponent with overblown or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/us/politics/hunter-biden-china.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share" title="">unsubstantiated assertions</a> about Hunter Biden&#8217;s business dealings there while his father was in office.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As for the former vice president, his public financial disclosures, along with the income tax returns he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://joebiden.com/financial-disclosure/#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voluntarily released</a>, show no income or business dealings of his own in China.

Education giant Pearson said it saw improved trading trends in the third quarter, with a fall in sales year-on-year growing less marked.

It said outturn for the full year would be “broadly in line with market expectations”, but warned of “larger than usual” uncertainties, particularly over international sales.

Sales in the third quarter were down 10pc year-on-year, a improvement on the second quarter’s 28pc decline. Online learning was the biggest driven of growth, up 32pc during the third quarter.

Overall, revenue for the first nine month of 2020 was 14pc lower than in 2019.

Outgoing chief executive John Fallon said:

This has been a challenging transformation for all of us but we are starting to see the benefit of all our work to ensure Pearson becomes the winner in digital learning.

It shares have hit a two-month high following the update. Shore Capital’s Roddy Davidson said there are signs that Pearson’s digital investment is paying off, adding there is a “positive medium-term outlook for global learning demand”.

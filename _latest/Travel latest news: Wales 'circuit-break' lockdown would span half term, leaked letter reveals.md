Wales is planning to announce a three-week “circuit breaker” shutdown that would span the half-term holiday, a leaked letter has revealed.

Details of the proposed lockdown measures are outlined in the letter (published by Bubble Wales) from John Pocket, the Wales director of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, to members, including that the “circuit break” would take effect at 6pm on October 23 and last until November 9.

The leaked document explains that “the message for public transport will be essential journeys only” and that “it will take us back to the situation in March when all but essential retail outlets were open – pubs, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers etc – were closed". It adds that financial government support for travel firms had been secured.

Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford is holding talks today ahead of an announcement on Monday – last week Mr Drakeford said his Government was "very actively talking about and preparing for" a circuit-breaker lockdown in Wales and called on the UK Government to consider adopting a short-term lockdown in England.

A four-week “circuit breaker” came into force in Northern Ireland on Friday, which includes the closure of pubs and restaurants, the extension of the half-term holiday from October 19-30 and advice against “unnecessary” travel.

In Wales, meanwhile, 17 out of 22 local authority areas are under local lockdown and the Welsh Government has banned visitors from Tier 2 and 3 areas of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

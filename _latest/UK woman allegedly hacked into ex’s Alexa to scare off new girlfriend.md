Senate Democrats placed ObamaCare front and center during the first...

A jilted British woman allegedly hacked into her ex-boyfriend’s Amazon Alexa device to scare off his new girlfriend, according to a report.

Philippa Copleston-Warren, 45, was accused in court of using the virtual assistant to flash the house lights and send warning messages after being dumped by her boyfriend of two years, according to the Sun.

“The defendant spoke through the Alexa account to tell the complainant’s friend in the property to leave and to take her stuff,” prosecutor Misba Majid told Westminster magistrates’ court.

“This so distressed the girlfriend, it caused her to cry and she left,” Majid said, according to the Sun.

The management consultant managed to control the device while she was in London, about 130 miles from her businessman ex’s house in Lincolnshire, the paper said.

She is also accused of hacking into her ex’s Facebook account and uploading nude pictures of him.

Copleston-Warren denied two counts of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress at last Thursday’s hearing. She was released on bail on condition she does not contact her ex, and is due to appear at a London crown court next month, the paper said.

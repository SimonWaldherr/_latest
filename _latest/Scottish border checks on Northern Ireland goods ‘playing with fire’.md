  Scottish border checks on Northern Ireland goods ‘playing with fire’ 
description: > 
  Nicola Sturgeon is accused of “playing with fire” over plans to impose strict post-Brexit border checks on goods arriving in Scotland from Northern Ireland.Under proposals discussed with trade bodies by Scottish officials, health checks would be required on some goods arriving from the Republic of Ireland via Northern Ireland at the port of Cairnryan from Jan 1, industry sources said.The UK has promised unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland entering Great Britain.But unlike customs checks, the power to apply sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks – to protect against disease, pests and contaminants – is devolved.If Scottish fishermen are seen to lose out in any final trade deal, experts warn that calls for another independence vote will grow.

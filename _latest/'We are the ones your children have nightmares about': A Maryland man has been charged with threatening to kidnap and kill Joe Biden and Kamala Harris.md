<p>"This is a warning to anyone reading this letter if you are a Biden/Harris supporter you will be targeted," the note read in part. "We have a list of homes and addresses by your election signs. We are the ones with those scary guns, We are the ones your children have nightmares about."</p><p>The remainder of the letter contained threats of murder, rape, and resistance to any infringement on the right to bear arms.</p><p>Reed was interviewed by federal authorities on October 13 but denied any involvement in the incident. On October 15, he confessed to the crime and was arrested.</p><p>"The right to vote and peacefully support the candidate of your choice are bedrocks of our democracy," US Attorney Robert K. Hur said in a statement. "Conduct like this that threatens major candidates and fellow citizens only undermines our democracy and the principles upon which America was founded. We will not tolerate threatening conduct that seeks to intimidate, harass or dissuade Americans from exercising their right to vote."</p>

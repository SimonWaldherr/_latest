Cardi B has spoken out on her apparent reconciliation with rapper Offset, from whom she filed for divorce last month.

“Listen y’all, I’m just a crazy bitch,” Cardi, 28, explained with her signature brio on Instagram Live Thursday. “You know how I be arguing with y’all on social media? That’s exactly how we are, between me and my man. So when people be saying I be doing s–t for attention, with this and that, no, I’m just a crazy bitch.”

“One day I’m happy, the next day I wanna beat a n—a up,” she continued. “I just be starting to miss [him]… It’s hard not to talk to your best friend. It’s really hard not to talk to your best friend. And it’s really hard to have no d–k.”

Fans had begun to speculate about the pair’s relationship after they were spotted kissing over the weekend at Cardi’s birthday celebration. Then there was the fact that her recent accidental topless selfie turned out to have been posted while she was in bed with Offset, 28, fans learned Wednesday.

“People been saying that I took him back like I’m materialistic,” Cardi said, addressing Offset’s six-digit birthday package for Cardi — a Rolls-Royce truck and custom leather car-seat for their daughter Kulture. “I do like material things, I like material things and everything, but I just didn’t … What do you want me to do? The n—a gave me a Rolls-Royce and I snub him?”

“And I really wanted some d–k for my birthday,” she added. “We’re just really typical, two young motherf—as who got married early, that’s what we are. We’re not no different than y’all f—in’ dysfunctional-a– relationships. We’re the same way. We’re just more public,” she concluded.

Cardi and Offset had been married for just shy of three years before she filed for divorce in September. Their marriage had been hampered by Offset’s serial infidelity; Cardi admitted to as much when she explained via OnlyFans that she left him as a pre-emptive measure against being embarrassed should he step out on her again.

But despite that, she continued to defend Offset on social media, claiming earlier this month that he was “not a bad man,” merely “a dumbass.”

Billboard reports that the two had a hearing in their divorce case scheduled for Nov. 4; it’s unclear how the case — in which Cardi elected to not pursue child support from Offset — will be proceeding in light of recent events.

<div><p>As British fellwalker Alfred Wainwright once said, there&#8217;s no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing. No-one&#8217;s asking you to walk up any fells (though if you have any to hand, it&#8217;s hard to find a better way to wear out the kids before bedtime); but come rain, wind or hail, you can dig out some suitable clothing and go and brave the elements.&#160;</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re doing so, encourage your children to look out for signs of autumn. You could even create a checklist for them to complete when you&#8217;re out, ticking off acorns, conkers, berries, pine cones, red leaves etc. Or just enjoy the colours of the foliage, which in the US they call leaf peeping. Introduce the concept to your children, because giving an activity a special name can sometimes make it feel like more of a big deal. (We said sometimes.)&#160;</p>
<p>Take a thermos flask of hot chocolate along for warmth and calorific thrills.</p>
<h3>2. Kids in charge day</h3>
<p>Yes, it sounds dangerous, but as long as you draw up the rules and maintain a few boundaries, it can be a really fun day for your children if you let them decide everything. Set a budget for the day and let them choose all the meals and activities. At the very least, they&#8217;ll hardly be able to complain of being bored.&#160;</p>
<h3>3. Sports day</h3>
<p>You may think <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/brands/gap-back-to-school/how-to-have-a-garden-sports-day/">this works better in summer than in autumn</a>, and you would be correct. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t create your own cold weather version. On a dry day, there&#8217;s nothing to prevent you doing many of the same events &#8211; egg and spoon race, sack race, tossing little bean bags into buckets&#160;&#8211; in the garden or park. But you need not restrict yourself to traditional sports day activities. You could include a penalty shoot out, boules or even a conker fight.&#160;</p>
<h3>4. Home science experiments&#160;</h3>
<p>The only limitation here is how much mess you can be bothered to clean up afterwards. Without having to fork out for too many costly materials, you could make: <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/how-to-grow/composting-worms-get-started-could-spark-urban-gardening-revolution/">a wormery</a>; a bird feeder; a windmill; a windsock using card, tissue paper and string; a string telephone; shadow puppets; a water wheel fashioned from empty yoghurt pots; bubble mix using washing up liquid and a bubble blower using an empty bottle; a paper helicopter. You could separate coloured inks using coffee filter paper; see what floats and sinks in a washing up bowl; grow sugar crystals. And it&#8217;s all educational!</p>

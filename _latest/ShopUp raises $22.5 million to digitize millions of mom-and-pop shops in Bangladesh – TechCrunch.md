<div><p id="speakable-summary">A startup that is aiming to digitize millions of neighborhood stores in Bangladesh just raised the country&#8217;s largest Series A financing round.</p>
<p>Dhaka-headquartered ShopUp said on Tuesday it has raised $22.5 million in a round co-led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-india-2" target="_blank">Sequoia Capital India </a> and Flourish Ventures. For both the venture firms, this is the first time they are backing a Bangladeshi startup. Veon Ventures, Speedinvest, and Lonsdale Capital also participated in the four-year-old ShopUp&#8217;s Series A financing round. ShopUp has raised about $28 million to date.</p>
<p>Like its neighboring nation, India, more than 95% of all retail in Bangladesh goes through neighborhood stores in the country. There are <a href="http://www.bbs.gov.bd/site/page/d13ee628-7458-4650-a824-6423d35d3620/Economic-Census-2013">about 4.5 million</a> such mom-and-pop stores in the country and the vast majority of them have no digital presence.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p><a href="https://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a> is attempting to change that. It has built what it calls a full-stack business-to-business commerce platform. It provides three core services to neighborhood stores: a wholesale marketplace to secure inventory, logistics (including last mile delivery to customers), and working capital, explained Afeef Zaman, co-founder and chief executive of ShopUp&#8203;, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p></p><img class="size-full wp-image-2062928" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ShopUp-retailer-picture-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"><p>These small shops are facing a number of challenges.&#160;They are not getting inventory on time or enough inventory and they are paying more than what they should, said Zaman. And for these businesses, <a href="file:///Users/refsrc/Downloads/11.10.18-MMLA-Research-Brief%20(1).pdf">more than 73%</a> (PDF) of all their sales rely on credit instead of cash or digital payments, creating a massive liquidity crunch. So most of these businesses are in dire need of working capital.</p>
<p>Zaman declined to reveal how many mom-and-pop shops today use ShopUp, but claimed that the platform assumes a clear lead in its category in the country. That lead has widened amid the global pandemic as more physical shops explore digital offerings to stay afloat, he said.</p>
<p>The number of neighborhood shops transacting weekly on the ShopUp platform grew by 8.5 times between April and August this year, he said. The pandemic also helped ShopUp engage with e-commerce players to deliver items for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sequoia India has been a strong supporter of the company since it was part of the first Surge cohort in early 2019 and it&#8217;s been exciting to see the company become a trailblazer facilitating digital transformation in Bangladesh,&#8221; said &#8203;Klaus Wang, VP, Sequoia Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup has no intention to become an e-commerce platform like Amazon that directly engages with consumers, Zaman said. E-commerce is still in its nascent stage in Bangladesh. Amazon has yet to enter the country and increasingly <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/bangladesh-economy-runs-on-facebook/">Facebook is filling that role</a>.</p>
<p>ShopUp sees immense opportunity in serving neighborhood stores, he said. The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to deepen its partnerships with manufacturers and expand its tech infrastructure.</p>
<p>It opened an office in Bengaluru earlier this year to hire local tech talent in the nation. Indian e-commerce platform Voonik <a href="https://entrackr.com/2020/02/unable-to-find-buyers-voonik-turns-to-bangladeshs-shopup/">merged with ShopUp this year</a> and both of its co-founders have joined the Bangladeshi startup. Zaman said the startup will hire more engineering talent in India.</p>

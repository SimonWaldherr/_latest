  NASA and Nokia are putting a 4G network on the moon

  New York (CNN Business) If you're unable to get a cell phone signal when you walk your dog around the block, this will really make your blood boil: NASA is putting a 4G network on the moon.NASA says 4G could provide more reliable, longer-distance communication than the current radio standards in place on the moon.Like on Earth, the 4G network will eventually be upgraded to 5GNokia's NOK Bell Labs was granted $14.1 million for the project.The moon's cellular network will also be specially designed to withstand the particularities of the lunar surface: extreme temperature, radiation and space's vacuum.It will also stay functional during lunar landings and launches, even though rockets significantly vibrate the moon's surface.

That could give us stuck on Earth a much better shot of astronauts bouncing around on the lunar surface: Buzz Aldrin was a great cameraman, but he didn't have an iPhone.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The 4G network on Earth is supported by giant cell towers with enormous power generators and radios. But Bell Labs helped create small cell technology that's more limited in range but uses far less power than traditional cell towers and is significantly easier to pack into a rocket ship. That small cell tech is currently being deployed for 5G networks across the world.</p></div>

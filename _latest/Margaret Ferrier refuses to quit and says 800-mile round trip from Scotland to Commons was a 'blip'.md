Nicola Sturgeon repeated her call for Ms Ferrier to resign her seat but insisted her party would have to go through "due process" before expelling her.

Ms Ferrier's refusal to quit is deeply embarrassing for Ms Sturgeon after the First Minister made a personal plea in a telephone to the MP, whom she described as a friend, to quit.

The Metropolitan Police has launched an investigation into a potential breach of coronavirus laws and she faces a separate Commons inquiry.

SNP chiefs are understood to believe that she will be suspended from Parliament for at least 10 sitting days, or 14 consecutive days, the benchmark that could allow her constituents to recall her and force a by-election.

But they are extremely worried that the longer Ms Ferrier clings on, the more damage will be inflicted to Ms Sturgeon's public health message to the Scottish people and her personal authority.

Ms Ferrier told The Sun on Sunday that she had "panicked" but remained adamant that she had followed the rules correctly.

Speaking of the backlash, she said: "You feel you're getting a lot of criticism from people you thought were your colleagues or friends who would understand it was one blip."

She told the paper: "This has been an awful experience but I'll keep fighting for my constituents because that's who I am."

The 60-year-old visit a beauty salon, gym and gift shop on the day she first displayed symptoms, Saturday, Sept 26, even buying a face mask in the latter.

Later the same day she travelled to a Covid testing centre after feeling increasingly unwell. However, she gave a church reading the following morning.

However, she took the train on the Monday to London while she awaited the results because she was "feeling much better" and spoke in a Commons coronavirus debate at 7.15pm that evening.

She learned of her positive test result that evening, shortly after speaking in the Commons, and told SNP whips she had to return to Scotland because of family illness.

The Commons authorities were informed on Sept 30 that she had the virus but it only emerged the following day that she had been tested before, not after her London trip.

<p>The regulation is mean to to keep bears out of the city, TWRA said.</p><p>"The overwhelming desire to have a close encounter with a black bear is strangely more powerful than common sense," Sevier County Wildlife Sgt. David Sexton said in the press release from TWRA. "Many people intentionally feed bears with little regard for the dire consequences to the bears and humans they leave behind."</p>

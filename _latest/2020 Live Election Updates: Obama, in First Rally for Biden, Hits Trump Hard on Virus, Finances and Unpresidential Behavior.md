How is that possible?&#8221; Mr. Obama asked a crowd of supporters invited to hear him speak in the parking lot of South Philadelphia Sports Complex.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He was referring to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/trump-taxes-china.html?smid=tw-share" title="">New York Times report</a> that revealed previously unknown financial holdings in China &#8212; at a time when the president is criticizing Joseph R. Biden Jr. for ties to that country.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Can you imagine if I had a secret Chinese bank account?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Can you imagine if I had secret Chinese bank account when I was running for re-election?&#8221; His voice straining, he added, &#8220;They would&#8217;ve called me Beijing Barry.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is &#8220;not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, adding that he had probably paid more in taxes working a high school job at an ice-cream parlor than Mr. Trump paid during each of his first two years as president &#8212; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/trump-750-taxes.html" title="">$750</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama&#8217;s long-anticipated speech, the first of several he intends to deliver on behalf of the Biden-Harris ticket over the next two weeks, marked a reversal of his initial reluctance to engage Mr. Trump directly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And even though his remarks, interrupted from time to time by the honking of horns at the drive-in rally, had moments of his signature soaring rhetoric, he seemed to divert somewhat from the kindler-gentler 2016 mantra inspired by his wife, &#8220;When they go low, we go high.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;By the way, his TV ratings are down,&#8221; the former president said. &#8220;So you know that upsets him. But the thing is, this is not a reality show. This is reality. And the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama, who has helped raise millions for his former vice president online but has not appeared in person at campaign events during the coronavirus pandemic, slammed Mr. Trump&#8217;s failure to contain the outbreak in more personal terms than he has used before.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Eight months into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Donald Trump isn&#8217;t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can&#8217;t even take the basic steps to protect himself.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama, who set aside his lofty campaign style in a go-for-the-jugular moment, seized on a misstep, recalling that Mr. Trump told supporters on Tuesday at a rally in western Pennsylvania that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/us/trump-biden-election/trump-says-before-coronavirus-he-never-planned-on-campaigning-in-erie-pa-we-had-this-thing-won" title="">he would not have visited them</a> if his campaign had not been struggling.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The president spent some time in Erie last night and apparently he complained about having to travel here,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, laughing. &#8220;Then he cut the event short. Poor guy. I don&#8217;t feel that way. I love coming to Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Philadelphia in August, for the virtual Democratic National Convention, Mr. Obama delivered a televised speech that cast the election as an existential battle for the future of American democracy. He struck those same themes in his return visit on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He said that Mr. Trump&#8217;s antics were unacceptable and wouldn&#8217;t be tolerated if the person were a school principal, coach or even a family member.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Why would we expect and accept this from the president of the United States?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He warned Democrats not to let up because of the polling advantage Mr. Biden is now seeing and said that some had become &#8220;lazy&#8221; in 2016. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care about the poll,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, referring to Hillary Clinton&#8217;s polling lead. &#8220;There were a whole bunch of polls last time. It didn&#8217;t work out.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to out hustle the other side,&#8221; he added, as the Democratic horns began to honk in unison.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Neil Vigdor</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-carries-on-his-twitter-tirade-against-lesley-stahl-and-60-minutes"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-carries-on-his-twitter-tirade-against-lesley-stahl-and-60-minutes">Trump carries on his Twitter tirade against Lesley Stahl and &#8216;60 Minutes.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A 2018 photo of Lesley Stahl of &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interviewing the president." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/21coronavirus-briefings-stahl1/merlin_145393479_fa04ed9d-1f0b-4632-8440-80b805296d0c-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A 2018 photo of Lesley Stahl of &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interviewing the president.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>CBS NEWS, via Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump continued his taunting of the &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; anchor Lesley Stahl on Twitter Wednesday, tweeting several photographs of himself with the CBS star he has been angry with since an as-yet-unaired interview she conducted with him at the White House on Tuesday that he called &#8220;fake and biased.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Among the images Mr. Trump posted were a sequence in which his press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, presented Ms. Stahl with a large book filled with what he said were his achievements on health care, an issue on which even some Republicans admit his record is thin.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump wrote that Ms. McEnany was providing Ms. Stahl &#8220;with some of the many things we&#8217;ve done for Healthcare. Lesley had no idea!&#8221; Ms. McEnany <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1318670969653858305" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> one of the same photos on Tuesday evening and wrote that Ms. Stahl &#8220;couldn&#8217;t believe how HUGE it was and said, &#8216;I can hardly lift this!!&#8217;&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Mr. Trump&#8217;s tweet on Wednesday became fodder for ridicule online. Noting that Mr. Trump has never delivered on regular promises to unveil a comprehensive health care plan to replace Obamacare, which he has worked to eliminate, Twitter users shared memes in which the book was variously filled with hundreds of blank pages, the names of people who had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1318673998671204353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1318673998671204353%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_1&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fkayleigh-mcenany-lesley-stahl-big-book-trump-health-care_n_5f8f6799c5b695a32fae5345" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost health insurance</a> under Mr. Trump&#8217;s presidency, or even <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/donmoyn/status/1318680476668858368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obituaries</a> for some of the more than 200,000 Americans who have died from coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Not so, Ms. McEnany said in an email.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It was a very large book of everything President Trump has signed &#8212; executive orders and legislation &#8212; to improve health care for Americans over the past three and a half years,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;All of these items are public, just compiled in one place in this book.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump grew irritated with Ms. Stahl&#8217;s questions during a 45-minute sit-down with her at the White House on Tuesday. According to people familiar with the exchange, the president refused to participate in a subsequent &#8220;walk-and-talk&#8221; that had been planned with Ms. Stahl and Vice President Mike Pence. He later tweeted a short video clip showing Ms. Stahl in the White House without a mask.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1318980039388561410/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Wednesday several photographs of Ms. Stahl speaking to him on camera, providing no commentary and thus leaving their point unclear &#8212; but perhaps suggesting he is ready to make good on a threat he tweeted on Tuesday to release White House video of their interview before &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; airs on CBS Sunday. The interview with the president is scheduled to be broadcast Sunday, and will also feature an interview with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senator Kamala Harris and Mr. Pence were also interviewed for the broadcast. Norah O&#8217;Donnell spoke with Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You have to watch what we do to &#8216;60 Minutes,&#8217;&#8221; Trump told supporters in Erie, Pa., on Tuesday night. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get such a kick out of it. You&#8217;re going to get a kick out of it. Lesley Stahl&#8217;s not going to be happy.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="giuliani-borat"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#giuliani-borat">Giuliani denies he did anything wrong in the new &#8216;Borat&#8217; movie.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Sacha Baron Cohen, left, features former New York Mayor Rudolph W.

Giuliani in his latest movie.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump&#8217;s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has become caught up in Sacha Baron Cohen&#8217;s new &#8220;Borat&#8221; satire, shown in an edited scene following an actress impersonating a reporter into a bedroom and at one point reclining on the bed and putting his hands in his pants in what he later said was an attempt to adjust his clothing.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The excerpt from Mr. Cohen&#8217;s new &#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,&#8221; which will be released on Friday, was posted on social media early Wednesday after The Guardian reported that the movie contained <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/21/rudy-giuliani-faces-questions-after-compromising-scene-in-new-borat-film" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;a compromising scene&#8221;</a> featuring Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Late Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani called into WABC radio in New York to say that he was tucking in his shirt after removing microphone wires, and chalked the scene&#8217;s early release up to a scheme to discredit his recent attempts to push corruption accusations against Joseph R. Biden Jr.&#8217;s son, Hunter Biden.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The Borat video is a complete fabrication,&#8221; Mr. Giuliani, 76, tweeted after he got off the air. &#8220;At no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate. If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I called the police,&#8221; he said in a brief text exchange on Wednesday. &#8220;He and all his crew ran away leaving their equipment behind.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A clip that surfaced on social media, heavily edited to fit the actor&#8217;s signature mockumentary format, begins with Mr. Giuliani, seated on a couch answering questions. Soon after, the actress, who speaks with a heavy Eastern European accent, asks the former mayor if they can continue their discussion in the bedroom. Mr. Giuliani agrees, and is then shown sitting on a bed, as she appears to take his microphone off and he appears to pat her.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The segment then cuts to the image of Mr. Giuliani, reclining on the bed, placing his hands down the front of his pants.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I had to take off the electronic equipment,&#8221; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMGqi76ihb4&amp;feature=emb_logo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Giuliani told the hosts of the &#8220;Curtis &amp; Juliet Show.</a>&#8221; &#8220;And when the electronic equipment came off, some of it was in the back and my shirt came a little out, although my clothes were entirely on. I leaned back, and I tucked my shirt in, and at that point, at that point, they have this picture they take which looks doctored, but in any event, I&#8217;m tucking my shirt in. I assure you that&#8217;s all I was doing.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The scene ends with Mr. Cohen, dressed in an outlandish pink costume, bursting in to the room and shouting that the woman, played by the actor <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7210025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Bakalova</a>, was 15 years old (the actor is 24, according to the IMDB database).</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Cohen was frightened by his call to the police, bolted away and left him talking with the filmmaker&#8217;s attorney.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The former mayor is not the first Republican politician to be ensnared in one of Mr. Cohen&#8217;s cringe-inducing pranks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In 2018, Mr. Cohen tricked the former G.O.P. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama into giving him an interview for the Showtime satire show &#8220;Who Is America?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Later in 2018, a Republican lawmaker in Georgia <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/arts/television/jason-spencer-sacha-baron-cohen.html" title="">resigned after he was fooled into repeatedly yelling a racial epithet on Mr. Cohen&#8217;s Showtime series</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, accused Mr. Cohen of pretending to be a disabled veteran to land an interview with her, which she said was part of his repeated attempts to humiliate and &#8220;devalue&#8221; middle-class Americans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;He&#8217;s got a lot of people &#8212; Newt Gingrich,&#8221; added Mr. Giuliani, who insisted he was not taken in by Mr. Cohen. &#8220;He got Donald Trump before he was president.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Cohen&#8217;s new movie, &#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,&#8221; is scheduled to be released on Friday on Amazon Prime.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Glenn Thrush</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="theyre-b-a-a-ck-plexiglass-dividers-return-to-the-debate-stage"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#theyre-b-a-a-ck-plexiglass-dividers-return-to-the-debate-stage">They&#8217;re b-a-a-ck!

Biden Jr. and President Trump will meet for their final debate on Thursday in Nashville. The dividers &#8212; described by campaign aides as seven feet tall and four feet wide &#8212; are a safety measure intended to help prevent any aerial transmission of the coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But their debut at the vice-presidential debate did not exactly merit good reviews.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Experts in airborne viruses called the plastic barriers basically useless, saying that an air filter and a box fan would be far more effective. Aides to Mike Pence called for the vice president to be allowed to debate without a dividers nearby, saying there was no justification for it.

Hoping to help solidify that lead, former President Barack Obama made his first live appearance on the campaign trail in Philadelphia Wednesday at a drive-in rally in support of Mr. Biden.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Texas, Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump were tied at 47 percent each, with a margin of 2.9 percentage points. Support for Mr. Trump in the reliably red state has dropped by 3 percentage points since last month, and Mr. Biden saw a bump of 2 percentage points.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The results were fairly similar to polling averages, which show Mr. Biden leading by about six points in Pennsylvania and Mr. Trump leading by about one point in Texas. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania by seven-tenths of a percentage point and Texas by nine points.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Quinnipiac also polled the race between Senator John Cornyn, a Republican of Texas, and his Democratic opponent, M.J.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and the chairman of the committee, argued this week that broader Senate rules only require a simple majority of all committee members present.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Republicans on the panel have the votes to recommend Judge Barrett&#8217;s confirmation to the full Senate, and are expected to do so unanimously.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Judge Barrett deserves a vote and she will receive a vote,&#8221; Mr. Graham said. &#8220;Judge Barrett deserves to be reported out of committee and she will be reported out of committee.

That he is campaigning in what should be a safely Republican state &#8212; and in others that were expected to be solidly in his column, like Iowa and Ohio &#8212; is evidence to many Democrats that Joseph R. Biden Jr.&#8217;s polling lead in the presidential race is solid and durable. Mr. Trump spent Monday in Arizona, too, a state that was once reliably Republican but where his unpopularity has helped make Mr. Biden competitive.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For some Democrats, Mr. Trump&#8217;s attention to red states is also a sign of something else &#8212; something few in the party want to discuss out loud, given their scars from Mr. Trump&#8217;s surprise victory in 2016. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/biden-election-landslide.html" title="">It&#8217;s an indication that Mr. Biden could pull off a landslide</a> in November, achieving an ambitious and rare electoral blowout that some Democrats think is necessary to quell any doubts &#8212; or disputes by Mr. Trump &#8212; that Mr. Biden won the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On one level, such a scenario is entirely plausible based on the weeks and the breadth of public polls that show Mr. Biden with leads or narrow edges in key states. But this possibility runs headlong into the political difficulties of pulling off such a win, and perhaps even more, the psychological hurdles for Democrats to entertain the idea. Many think that Mr. Trump, having pulled off a stunning win before, could do it again, even if there are differences from 2016 that hurt his chances.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">This much is clear: Landslide presidential victories have become rare &#8212; the last big one was in 1988, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/world/americas/07iht-07elect.17608839.html" title="">a more modest one in 2008</a> &#8212; and Mr. Trump is still ahead of or running closely with Mr. Biden in many of the states he won in 2016 when the margin of error is factored in.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats see flipping states like Texas and Georgia as key to a possible landslide; Texas hasn&#8217;t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976, and Georgia since 1992. A New York Times and Siena College poll published on Tuesday found Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/upshot/poll-georgia-biden-trump.html" title="">tied among likely voters in Georgia</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Until Democrats win a statewide election, we&#8217;re not a purple state,&#8221; said Brian Robinson, a Republican political consultant in Georgia. &#8220;We may be a purpling state.

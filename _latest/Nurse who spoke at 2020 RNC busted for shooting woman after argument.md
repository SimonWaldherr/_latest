A West Virginia nurse who spoke at the Republican National Convention in August was arrested for shooting a woman in the gut after an argument, according to reports.

Amy Thorn, 39, gained attention after volunteering to work in New York in April, and later to San Antonio to treat COVID-19 patients.

Also known as Amy Ford, the name she used when she spoke on the opening night of the RNC, Thorn became something of a local hero because of her efforts to fight the virus and was later honored at a White House ceremony.

The daughter of a nurse and a coal miner, in her speech, Thorn praised the policy changes that expanded video visits, or “telehealth,” and enabled such visits to be covered by Medicare and private insurance policies. “Increased access to telehealth for millions of Americans has truly been lifesaving, and we have President Trump to thank,” she said in her speech.

The shooting took place late Thursday in the town of Williamson in southeastern West Virginia.

Police said Thorn shot Jonda Whitt in the abdomen during an argument, WCHS reported.

Williamson Police Chief Grady Dotson said Thorn claimed she had become fearful for her safety and had told Whitt she had a gun. “She went to the car and got the gun out of the car,” Dotson said, local news outlet the Mingo Messenger reported.

Whitt was taken to a local hospital, then airlifted to the Pikeville Medical Center in Pikeville, Ky., where she underwent surgery. Her injuries were not life-threatening. Details regarding what the argument was about were not immediately available.

In a statement to police, Thorn claimed the shooting was in self-defense. She was charged with malicious wounding and released on $5,000 bond.

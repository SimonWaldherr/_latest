They married in an intimate ceremony in Northern California on Friday.

And Kelly Dodd and her new husband Rick Leventhal were spotted back in Los Angeles for the first time since tying the knot.

On Tuesday the 45-year-old Real Housewives Of Orange County star and the 60-year-old Fox News correspondent stepped out in sporty outfits to take their two adorable dogs out for a walk.

Kelly was dressed simply in a camouflage T-shirt and a matching set of shorts that highlighted her toned and tanned legs.

She wore a set of white trainers and blocked out the sun with white cat-eye sunglasses while sweeping her brunette tresses behind a striped charcoal headband.

Rick looked ready for a workout in a gray Nike tank top and black shorts with a backwards baseball cap and gray and black athletic shoes.

He had a fluffy white dog on his leash, while his wife walked her cute apricot Maltipoo Benji.

Kelly also shared the stage with her daughter Jolie, who stunned in a white ruched off-the-shoulder dress while posing with her mother.

The reality star added in the captions that she had 'lived in SF for almost 10 years,' and so she had a great affection for the Napa area and had 'lots of friends here.'

'They’ve been through so much with the wildfires & one big reason we still wanted to get married here was to support local businesses. Thank you! ❤️ ' she added.

Kelly and Rick first met in the summer of last year at Ramona Singer's Hamptons party, and they two were dating by August.

The journalist popped the question to Kelly in November 2019, after decorating her apartment full of flowers and champagne bottles.

While speaking with Bravo Insider last week, Kelly said their nuptials would be 'intimate' and they would only have 'limited guests.'

She and Rick had black and white masks custom made for the their guests to wear at the ceremony that featured their names on the front.

The move toward increased safety contrasted with Kelly's behavior earlier this month, when she was criticized by RHOC fans after attending her surprise bridal shower while flouting social distancing recommendations and ignoring California's mask mandate.

Although she shared a photo of all the guests wearing masks later, it was clearly just a move to pacify her critics, as other photos from the event showed everyone maskless.

She was also criticized for wearing a 'Drunk Wives Matter' hat at the bridal shower, after previously criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement.

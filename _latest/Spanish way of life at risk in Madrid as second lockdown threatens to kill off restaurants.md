Madrid has always been a nocturnal city, but now the Spanish capital’s famous hospitality sector says it is in danger of being permanently ruined by Covid-19 curfews that fail to accommodate local traditions of late-night socialising.

Ernest Hemingway noted in Death in the Afternoon that “Nobody goes to bed in Madrid until they have killed the night,” and the custom of meeting at or after midnight is as real today as it was when the book about bullfighting was published in 1932.

Currently, however, Madrid is the leading Spanish hotspot for Covid-19 transmission, leading to a series of measures that have cut short the night and are driving businesses such as restaurants and bar to the wall.

After Spain’s national state of emergency lockdown was lifted in June, nightclubs were initially allowed to open, but a steep rise in cases amongst young people saw an across-the-board closing time of 1am imposed in August, before the latest restrictions have brought that forward to 11pm.

With customers not allowed to order dinner after 10pm, Madrid’s restaurant owners says their takings have plummeted over the past week since the rule was introduced.

“The Spanish don’t leave their house until 10pm usually,” said Maria Maisey, who, along with her also-English husband, has for the last three years run Amicis, a restaurant in central Madrid near the city’s emblematic Plaza Mayor square.

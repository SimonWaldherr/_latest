<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But any notion that life in America might be returning to normal within weeks, or even within a few months, was too hopeful, other officials and experts said. The public health strategies with which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/us/coronavirus-pandemic-fatigue.html" title="">the public is fatigued</a> will be needed for some time to come, even after new drugs and vaccines can be approved. And compliance with those strategies is already spotty.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The statistics are headed the wrong way: More than 70,450 new coronavirus cases were reported in the United States on Friday, the highest figure since July 24, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">according to a New York Times database</a>, and more than 900 new deaths were recorded. Case counts are rising in 41 of the 50 states, with much of the worst news in the Great Lakes region.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the public did not know whom or what to believe about how soon a vaccine would be available. Communicating clearly and credibly with the public is just as important as the science, Dr. Osterholm said, because slowing the spread of the virus depends on individuals taking the right precautions.</p><p></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">With infections rising and compliance eroding, &#8220;the next six to 12 weeks are going to be the darkest of the entire pandemic,&#8221; he said on &#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">A similar warning was sounded by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. He said on the CBS program &#8220;Face the Nation&#8221; that the country was headed into &#8220;probably the most difficult phase of this epidemic.&#8221; &#8220;I think the next three months are going to be very challenging,&#8221; he said.</p></div>

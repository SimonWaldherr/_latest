description: > 
  Mark J. Terrill/Associated PressMichael Porter Jr. is apparently untouchable in trade talks after showcasing his potential during the 2020 NBA playoffs for the Denver Nuggets, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst."In talking to teams around the league, the Nuggets have made it clear: Michael Porter Jr. is not available," Windhorst said on the Hoop Collective podcast (h/t RealGM).Porter sat out his entire first season with a back injury but played well in 2019-20, averaging 9.3 points and 4.7 rebounds per game.He contributed 11.4 points and 6.7 rebounds per game in the Nuggets' 19-game postseason during the team's run to the Western Conference Finals.Denver now has an exciting core with Murray, Jokic and Porter all under team control through at least 2022.

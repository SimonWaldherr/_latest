Covid rates in university towns are over 40 per cent higher than the rest of the UK, an analysis by The Telegraph has revealed.

Virus hotspots are emerging in student areas around the country with the number of new cases up to 38 times higher following freshers’ week, official data shows.

It comes as a leading public health expert warns that students must not be blamed for fuelling outbreaks in their local areas as he says it is “inevitable” that a lot of young people will catch the virus.

The Telegraph analysed Covid-19 cases before and after the start of Freshers’ week for every university in the UK.

It reveals the trajectory of new Covid-19 cases is rising more rapidly among areas with student populations, as outbreaks erupt in university halls and teaching is taken online to combat the problem.

On September 1 the average daily rate of infections per 100,000 people in areas with universities was 29.4 per cent higher than areas with no students - likely as those areas tend to be larger cities and urban areas with dense populations.

But since the return of almost 2.5m students across the UK, average infection rates have climbed to 42.4 per cent higher among major university towns and cities, an increase of 13 percentage points.

<div><h2>What&#8217;s your favourite Gavin and Stacey memory?</h2>
<p>There are a few. Filming the hen party was very memorable because we had a real-life stripper. I won&#8217;t go into too many details, but I&#8217;ve never experienced a stripper before - and I&#8217;ve never experienced a stripper afterwards either. When we filmed it I just remember the camera was shaking because the cameraman was laughing so much. I was in shock, I was laughing hysterically, and I couldn&#8217;t stop talking about it that evening. It was an experience.</p>

                            <p>Another one of my favourite scenes was in the Christmas special when we were all around the table for Christmas dinner. We spent about three days filming that and it was so lovely because Rob Brydon made us laugh nonstop. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve laughed so much in my life. And then James Corden came in and introduced Sonia to all of us. He was so naughty and had a glint in his eye. In every single take he&#8217;d say and do something different and we were in hysterics and I just remember Mat Horne erupting and exploding with laughter &#8211; and normally he doesn&#8217;t laugh at all. We were just hysterical, and it was just like being with your family on Christmas Day.</p>

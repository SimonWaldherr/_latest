The Government has provoked "unanimous fury" among the leaders of Greater Manchester, which has still not been added to tier three despite crunch talks this morning.

Matt Hancock confirmed that a call between Greater Manchester leaders and Downing Street officials failed to reach an agreement on new restrictions. It is thought local leaders are holding out for a better financial package.

Labour's Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, said there was "unanimous fury" about the way the talks had been handled. She called for "meaningful conversations" to come to a conclusion to help reduce infection rates while protecting businesses.

A furious William Wragg, the Conservative MP for Hazel Grove, said the meeting had been "entirely pointless - you may as well talk to the wall".

Wigan's Labour frontbencher Lisa Nandy said: "Despite repeated attempts to claim we're divided there was total unity from Conservative and Labour Greater Manchester MPs on the call with the Minister this morning.

"We will support evidence based interventions with adequate financial support. We will not support this chaos."

Mr Hancock urged MPs "to work together for the best outcome for the people of Greater Manchester". But speaking separately, the Prime Minister's official spokesman made it clear unilateral action could be taken.

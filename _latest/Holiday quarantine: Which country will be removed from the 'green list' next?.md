Turkey, Poland and Bonaire became the latest countries to be removed from the UK's quarantine-free travel list last week.

It means there are now even fewer holiday options for Britons that don't require a bout of self-isolation, and, with cases rising across Europe, more destinations could lose their "travel corridors" this week.

So the question is, could your holiday destination be affected? Here we take a look at the most popular European countries that are currently on the UK quarantine-free list, crunch how cases are on the rise, and examine whether they could soon be removed.

As a rule of thumb, the Government starts getting twitchy when a country's seven-day case rate exceeds 20 per 100,000. However, the UK's own case rate has now passed that threshold (as of October 7, it stands at 115.1), so it seems to be exercising a little more leniency.

Ireland, Sweden, Italy, Lithuania, Estonia and Greece are the countries on the green list with the highest case rates (66.6, 36.1, 28.5, 27.9, 26 and 22.5, respectively), so appear the most likely to face the chop (although Ireland, Lithuania and Estonia already have restrictions on UK arrivals). However, other factors come into play such as a country's population size, the number of Britons who visit, and other measures introduced to stop the spread of the virus.

Given the complications posed by the Common Travel Area, Ireland may well be spared. Furthermore, the new regional approach means that some Greek islands could be targeted instead of the mainland. Already the likes of Santorini, Crete and Zakynthos have been removed from the travel corridors list.

The UK Government reviews its policy every Thursday, announcing changes on Twitter at 5pm, with destinations usually removed from 4am on a Saturday morning.

Greece

Latest daily rise in cases: 406 (4 deaths)

Per 100,000 (last 7 days): 22.5

Greece recorded 453 new cases on September 21, its highest daily figure since May, and was removed from Scotland's travel "green list" recently. Furthermore, several islands, including Crete and Mykonos, have been removed from the quarantine-free lists of England and Wales. However, deaths remain low and, despite the country's seven-day case rate creeping above 20 per 100,000, it looks unlikely to be removed from the UK-wide list this week.

The FCDO website states: "You must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before your arrival in Greece. Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter the country.

"Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email acknowledgement. In a separate email, you will also receive a QR code. This code is likely to be sent up to 24 hours before you travel, regardless of how early you fill in your form. When you receive your code, make sure you either print it, or can show it on your mobile phone."

Germany

Latest daily rise in cases: 3,994 (17 deaths)

Per 100,000 (last 7 days): 20.1

Germany has seen daily infections above 2,000 numerous times in the last few weeks, and the 3,994 recorded on October 7 was a six-month record. It has imposed tougher rules on mask wearing and will keep fans out of stadiums until at the least the end of the year to combat the rise.

However, its seven-day figure remains relatively low at 20.1 per 100,000. It currently looks a fairly solid bet for a last-minute quarantine-free holiday.

Italy

Latest daily rise in cases: 3,678 (31 deaths)

Per 100,000 (last 7 days): 28.5

While the holiday favourites of France and Spain have seen a big rise in new cases, Italy had seen fewer signs of a second spike. However, in the last month its infection rate has more than trebled. It looks at risk this week, although its positivity rate remains low in comparison to other nations at around 2 per cent. This could be its saving grace.

Sweden

Latest daily rise in cases: 569

Per 100,000 (last 7 days): 36.1

Having been snubbed for months, Sweden finally got its first travel corridor in September. However, since then its case rate has crept up. It also appears at risk this week, although the UK now appears to be exercising a degree of leniency given its own high case rate.

The safest options

The following countries have a seven-day case rate below 18 per 100,000, are not on the quarantine list, and are feasible holiday options for UK travellers:

San Marino (14.8)



Cyprus (13.7)

Antigua (6.2)



Barbados (3.5)



St Lucia (0.5)

Book with caution

The following countries have a case rate above 18, are not yet on the quarantine list, and are open to UK travellers:

Germany (20.1)

Greece (22.5)

Italy (28.5)

Sweden (36.1)

What is the quarantine fine?

British holidaymakers could face a £1,000 penalty or even an unlimited fine if they fail to self-isolate for 14 days after arriving in the UK under new public health measures.

All arrivals to the country are required to complete an information form “to provide contact and travel information so they can be contacted if they, or someone they may have been in contact with, develops the disease.”

Failure to complete the form is punishable by a £100 fixed penalty notice.

Four weeks after coming into effect, the police had not issued a single fine for an individual failing to observe quarantine.

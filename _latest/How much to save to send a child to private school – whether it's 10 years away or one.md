Money put into a savings account is unlikely to keep pace with inflation. Parents could therefore find themselves having to put away larger and larger sums if they save in cash. Over 10 years they would have to save an average of £850 a month, calculations by Brewin Dolphin, a wealth manager, show. This assumes they earn interest of 1pc on their savings and that inflation is 2pc a year.

By investing the money, and benefiting from stock market growth, they could reach the same goal by contributing £666 a month. Over those 10 years they would have had to save around £80,000 – £20,000 less than if they’d put away money as cash. This assumes their investments return 5pc a year on average after fees.

Five years to save

Parents with just five years to save would have to put away more per month, as their investments would have less time to grow in value. However the total amount they would have to save would be less, as they would only have to cope with five years of fee increases rather than 10.

They would have to invest £1,100 per month – £66,000 in total over the period – assuming their investment returns and fee inflation were the same as above.

Two years to save

Investing with a short time frame can be risky, as stock markets can go through bumpy patches. So with just two years to go until their child starts secondary school, parents should save as cash.

They would have to put aside £1,665 per month, assuming they managed to secure an interest rate of 1pc. Most easy-access accounts pay less than this. Parents who are willing to lock their money away during that time could get a higher return.

The best interest rates for a two-year fixed rate bond at the moment are 1.4pc from The Access Bank UK and 1.31pc from Charter Savings Bank. On a two-year fixed-rate cash Isa, the top deal pays 1.05pc from Hodge Bank.

One year to save

With just a year to go until their child enters year seven, parents will have to save £1,880 each month to cover their school fees, Brewin Dolphin calculated. Again, this factors in a 1pc return on their cash. They would have to put away fractionally less if they took out the best one-year fixed rate bond on the market paying 1.18pc from Atom Bank.

Brewin Dolphin’s Carla Morris said: “If you know that you will want your children to go to private school, the key to saving for the fees is to start as early as you possibly can. If your financial situation changes for the better at a later date, then you will have a pot of savings available for other things.”

<div><p>The US intelligence community warned Americans Wednesday night that Iran and Russia are trying to interfere in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and FBI director Christopher Wray said in a press conference that Iran has targeted voters through spoof emails.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe added that &#8220;some voter registration information&#8221; has been obtained by both countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters &#8230; that will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,&#8221; Ratcliffe said.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported Wednesday that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/20/proud-boys-emails-florida/">Iranian agents had sent threatening emails</a> to the Democratic voters in Florida and Alaska pretending to be members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that backs President Trump.</p>
<p>The Iranian agents threatened voters that they were &#8220;in possession of all your information&#8221; and demanded they change their party affiliation and vote for Trump, according to the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you,&#8221; the emails read, according to the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe added Iran is also circulating a video that claims there is widespread voter fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iran is distributing other content to include a video that implies individuals could cast fraudulent ballots, even from overseas. This video and any claims about such allegedly fraudulent ballots are not true,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Both Wray and Ratcliffe reassured Americans they were taking steps to thwart the attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are standing before you now to give you confidence that we are on top of this,&#8221; Ratcliffe said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be confident that your vote counts. Early, unverified claims to the contrary should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism,&#8221; Wray said. &#8220;We are not going to let our guard down.&#8221;</p>

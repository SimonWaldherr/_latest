Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett shot down the likelihood of marriage equality being overturned in questioning during her second day of confirmation hearings before the Senate.

Asked Tuesday by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) how she would handle a case where a state tried to outlaw same-sex marriage, Barrett shut down the likelihood of that happening.

“If [a state] outlawed same-sex marriage, there would have to be a case challenging it. And for the Supreme Court to take it up, you’d have to have lower courts going along and say, ‘We’re going to flout Obergefell,'” the Supreme Court nominee explained, referencing Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark case the legalized gay marriage nationwide.

“And the most likely result would be that lower courts, who are bound by Obergefell, would shut such a lawsuit down and it wouldn’t make its way up to the Supreme Court. But if it did, it would be the same process I’ve described [for how I would address the case,]” the 48-year-old judge continued.

Barrett, who is currently facing her first day of questioning from senators, was also asked about her judicial philosophy by the South Carolina Republican.

Graham jokingly asked her to explain her answer “in English,” noting that fellow Judiciary member Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) was a constitutional scholar who regularly used flowery language to explain legal jargon.

“In English, that means that I interpret the Constitution as a law, that I interpret its text as text, and I understand it to have the meaning that it had at the time people ratified it. So that meaning doesn’t change over time, and it’s not up to me to update it or infuse my own policy views into it,” she explained of being an originalist.

Asked by Graham to respond to being labelled the “female Scalia,” a reference to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, an ardent originalist for whom Barrett clerked from 1998-1999, the judge was hesitant to accept the moniker.

“I would say that Justice Scalia was obviously a mentor. And as I said, when I accepted the president’s nomination, that his philosophy is mine, too. You know, he was a very eloquent defender of originalism and that was also true of textualism which is the way that I approach statutes and the interpretations,” she began, expressing praise for the late justice.

Still, she cautioned, “I want to be careful to say that if I am confirmed, you would not be getting Justice Scalia. You would be getting Justice Barrett.”

Barrett went on to explain that just as originalists don’t always agree, textualists do not either.

Sources close to City Hall call him "Mr Misery". Watching Sadiq Khan deliver the devastating news that London, the UK's economic powerhouse, was being plunged into a new Tier 2 lockdown with his acquiescence, it would be hard to disagree.

Sitting behind his desk and turning the pages of a huge A4 lever arch file, the London Mayor read out a statement in a monotone voice that could send shivers down anyone's spine.

It may explain, too, the body warmer Mr Khan wore under his suit jacket, as if reinforcing the chill wind blowing through the capital.

On Twitter, Londoners wondered whether City Hall was now so hard up that it couldn't pay its heating bill. One suggested the Mayor was getting himself "ready for Tier 2 Beer Garden Life in his body warmer", in reference to new rules that will prevent friends from mixing indoors but – for the moment – allow socialising in pub gardens under the "rule of six".

As it turns out, City Hall's heating is on the blink and has been for the past three weeks. Insiders say the heating breakdown has coincided with the Mayor's recent "grumpy" mood. Others suggest he is exhausted, staying up late at night as he tries to stay on top of the Covid-19 crisis.

"He is workmanlike and needs that time to get through the data," said one source.

In contrast to Mr Khan's low-key statement, nodding through Downing Street's demands for stricter measures in London, hours later, Manchester's Mayor Andy Burnham – wearing an anorak that every Mancunian would appreciate – went out with all guns blazing.

Bethenny Frankel and boyfriend Paul Bernon have called it quits after two years of dating, Page Six has exclusively learned.

“They broke up a couple of weeks [ago], and are saying it’s because of distance, but you know Bethenny,” a source told us.

The couple met in 2018 after Frankel’s on-and-off boyfriend, Dennis Shields, died.

“I remember telling Tinsley [Mortimer], ‘I really like him,’ ” Frankel said of Bernon during her final “Real Housewives of New York City” reunion (she left the Bravo show in 2019).

“And I felt like an idiot, because I was saying I felt like it could be the one or something. I was really into him and we went out a couple of times. And I just wasn’t really ready … I wanted someone to give me a guaranteed, ‘This is the guy’ because I didn’t want to get hurt.”

Frankel and Bernon, who lives in Boston, often posted selfies from their getaways and doted on each other in Instagram posts.

“I like me better when I’m with you,” she captioned one selfie last year, referencing Lauv’s song “I Like Me Better.” He responded: “I’m good as long as you’re here with me.”

The duo even celebrated #NationalCouplesDay in August. But they split just as they were to hit their two-year anniversary in September.

Meanwhile, Frankel is still fighting to get divorced from her estranged husband, Jason Hoppy, after ending their relationship seven years ago.

“I’m still married,” Frankel revealed to Andy Cohen when she appeared on his “Watch What Happens Live” show last month.

Splits aside, the Skinnygirl mogul recently launched her new “Just B” podcast and it’s “going great,” according to another insider.

“She is lining up really good guests, A-listers! She’s featured at the top of new business shows on Apple,” said the insider, who was mum on the split.

Frankel previously hosted a daytime talk show, which lasted one season.

A rep for Frankel did not comment.

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/13/slayer-pete-buttigieg-joe-biden-fox-news" class="u-underline">Speaking on Fox News Sunday</a>, Buttigieg, who married his husband Chasten in 2018, indicated that the court&#8217;s 2015 decision that made same-sex marriage legal was among a number of rulings a strong conservative majority could look to overturn.</p>
<p>Republicans are seeking to seat Barrett before the 3 November general election. The Senate judiciary committee will vote this week on forwarding the nomination to a full floor vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now as we speak the pre-existing condition [healthcare] coverage of millions of Americans might depend on what is about to happen in the Senate with regard to this justice,&#8221; Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My marriage might depend on what is about to happen in the Senate with regard to this justice. So many issues are on the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>The right to same-sex marriage were enshrined in Obergefell v Hodges, the culmination of a years-long fight incorporating challenges from several states and decided by the landmark 5-4 ruling.</p>
<p>Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said Republicans pushing through Barrett&#8217;s nomination days before the election, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, sent the wrong message to voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not in the spirit of our constitution, or our legal system, or political system for them to do this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most Americans believe that the American people ought to have a say. We&#8217;re not talking about an election that&#8217;s coming up, we&#8217;re in the middle of an election, millions of Americans are voting and want their voice to be heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;There&#8217;s an enormous amount of frustration that this Senate can&#8217;t even bring itself, with Mitch McConnell, to vote through a Covid relief package. People are suffering, people are hurting, there&#8217;s no clear end in sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a bill we brought to them months ago coming out of the house, they won&#8217;t touch it, they won&#8217;t do anything but suddenly they have time to rush through a nomination that the American people don&#8217;t want.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever specific word you use for it, wrong is the word I would use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buttigieg defended himself against a claim from Wallace that he had talked about expanding the court to 15 justices, so-called court packing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My views haven&#8217;t changed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bipartisan reform with the purpose of reducing the politicisation of the supreme court is a really promising idea. Let&#8217;s also be clear that a president can&#8217;t just snap their fingers and do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is my favourite season: the lower light flatters the garden, emphasising the glorious colours with the longer shadows giving everything more depth. The bright and bleaching summer sun earlier in the year is not nearly so kind.</p>
<p>Now much less fire fighting is needed on weeds, lawns and hedges, as all the growth is (thankfully) slowing down, allowing me to do more leisurely and enjoyable tasks.</p>
<p>But big changes can still happen fast, even overnight, with downpours, mini gales or plummeting temperatures causing whole stands of plants to be flattened, blooms to dissolve, or even new stunners to appear.</p>
<p>To keep the garden looking its best and maintain as much glamorous colour as you can, deadheading and tidying is vital. Happily, it is also relatively relaxing, and is simple to master.</p>
<p>Deadheading is a smart piece of trickery: you are fooling your plants into believing they are still youthful. As soon as they are allowed to set seed, chemical messages are sent back telling flower production to stop. Stop them doing this, and they will continue to look beautiful.</p>

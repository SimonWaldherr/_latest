<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more</p><p>Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, whose committee investigated Hunter Biden&#8217;s business dealings, should be &#8220;ashamed&#8221; for claiming that Biden and his son <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/">profited off the former vice president&#8217;s influence</a>.</p>
<p>During an interview Tuesday on <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/one-on-one-with-joe-biden/34431537" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WISN 12 in Milwaukee</a>, Biden was asked whether there was any legitimacy to a <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/majority-media/-a-scandal-in-and-of-itself-johnson-hits-mainstream-media-for-ignoring-biden-conflicts-of-interest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement released Monday by Johnson</a> on Senate Homeland Security Committee letterhead, saying the Biden family profited off his name and faulting the media for &#8220;<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/fcc-staffer-ayatollah-khamenei-can-still-tweet-but-the-post-cant/">suppressing</a>&#8221; the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatsoever,&#8221; Biden said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the same garbage Rudy Giuliani, Trump&#8217;s henchman. It&#8217;s a last ditch effort in this desperate campaign to smear me and my family,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>The Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">reported</a> last Wednesday on a trove of emails found on Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop that show his father was aware of his business dealings in Ukraine and China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the man who served with him on that committee&#8230; The former nominee for the Republican Party, said there&#8217;s no basis to this. And the vast majority of the intelligence people have come out and said, there&#8217;s no basis at all. Ron should be ashamed of himself,&#8221; Biden said.</p>
<p>Sen. Mitt Romney, who serves on the Homeland Security panel and was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, in September <a href="https://www.startribune.com/romney-says-biden-probe-not-legitimate-role-of-government/572431922/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized Johnson&#8217;s probe</a> into Hunter Biden, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s not the legitimate role of government or Congress &#8230; to be used in an effort to damage political opponents.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>And while some former intelligence community officials have called the emails found on Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop that connect his father to his business dealings in Ukraine part of a &#8220;Russian disinformation campaign,&#8221; the Justice Department and the director of national intelligence shot down that notion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop is not part of some Russian disinformation campaign,&#8221; DNI John Ratcliffe <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/john-ratcliffe-info-on-hunter-biden-laptop-not-russian-disinformation/">told Fox News</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>The Justice Department <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/doj-agrees-hunter-biden-emails-are-not-russian-disinformation-report/">agreed</a> with Ratcliffe&#8217;s assessment and confirmed that the FBI is now in possession of Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden allegedly dropped the laptop off at a Wilmington, Del., computer repair store in April 2019 and never returned to pick it up.</p>
<p>In one email sent to Hunter Biden, an adviser on the board of Burisma thanked the son for giving him the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to meet his father.</p>
<p>The email was sent when Hunter Biden had a lucrative seat on the board and his father was the vice president and in charge of American policy in Ukraine.</p>
 
<p>In the interview, Biden also said he&#8217;s happy the Commission on Presidential Debates has <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/commission-will-mute-mics-during-final-debate-between-trump-biden/">decided to mute</a> the microphones of each candidate after the first debate between him and President Trump turned into a chaotic shouting match.</p>
<p>&#8220;There should be more limitations on us not interrupting one another,&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;And so I hope he&#8217;s going to come prepared to talk about what he&#8217;s for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden added that he expects Trump to launch &#8220;personal attacks,&#8221; &#8220;because he doesn&#8217;t want to talk about why he&#8217;s taking away healthcare at the very time we&#8217;re in the middle of a pandemic, why he has no plan for healthcare, why he hasn&#8217;t provided the money to allow businesses to have the ability to reopen, why he&#8217;s not dealing with unemployment, etc.,&#8221; he said.</p>

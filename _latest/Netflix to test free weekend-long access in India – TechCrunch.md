<div><p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank">Netflix </a> plans to give users in India access to its service at no charge for a weekend as part of a test to expand its reach in the country, a top company executive said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The American streaming giant, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/netflix-growth-q3/">reported slow users growth for the quarter that ended in September</a>, recently&#160;stopped offering a first-month complimentary access to new users in the U.S. But the company plans to keep experimenting with new ways to lure potential customers,&#160;said Greg Peters, COO and Chief Product Officer at Netflix on the company&#8217;s earnings call.</p>
<p>One of those new ways is giving away access to Netflix at no charge to customers for a weekend in different markets, he said. The company has picked India as the first market where it will test this idea and &#8220;will see how that goes,&#8221; from there, he said.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>&#8220;We think that giving away everyone in a country access to Netflix for free for a weekend could be a great way to expose a bunch of new people to the amazing stories that we have, the service and how it works &#8230; and hopefully get a bunch of those folks to sign up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t be the first time Netflix uses India as a test bed to explore new ideas. The company first flirted with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/netflix-is-testing-a-mobile-only-subscription-to-make-its-service-more-affordable/">idea of a $2.7 mobile-only monthly plan</a> in New Delhi before introducing it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/netflix-malaysia-mobile-only-cheap-plan/">as a permanent tier in the country</a> and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/netflix-malaysia-mobile-only-cheap-plan/">nearly a dozen markets</a>.</p>

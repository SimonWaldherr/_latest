Sugar daddy: This Hamptons manse, customized by architect Daniel Romualdez for ex-real estate exec Alan Rogers, is going for nearly $12 million.

The Hamptons’ vaunted Sugar Cube House is now on the market for $11.95 million, down from its $12.45 million asking price in June.

The 6,000-square-foot home was “reimagined” by architect Daniel Romualdez for Alan Rogers, a former chairman and CEO of Douglas Elliman, in 2002.

At the time, Rogers told Architectural Digest that he wanted to give the “ordinary” two-story stucco home, located at 150 First Neck Lane in Southampton, some 1940s-style “Hollywood glamour.”

“My instructions to Daniel were to produce a non-Hamptons house,” Rogers told AD, adding that geometric sugar cubes might serve as an inspiration. Romualdez came through.

Now a six-bedroom, 7½-bathroom home that resembles the sweet squares, the property comes with a pool and sits on 1 acre in a coveted spot south of the highway.

The spread features a main floor with an eat-in chef’s kitchen, a home office, a guest master suite, a living room with double-height ceilings and a fireplace and a covered terrace overlooking gardens.

Upstairs, a master suite features a fireplace, an en-suite bathroom, a walk-in closet and a private deck, along with three more bedrooms.

The home’s finished basement boasts a gym, a lounge area and a wine cellar. Outside, there’s another kitchen, a lavender garden and a pool house. The listing broker is Elliman’s Michaela Keszler.

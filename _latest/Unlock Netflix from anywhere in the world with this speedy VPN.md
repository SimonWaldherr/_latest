SAVE 79%: An 18-month subscription to CyberGhost VPN is on sale for £2.15 per month as of Oct. 16, saving you 79% on list price.

We know that most users don't invest in VPNs for the data protection and online security. These are generally considered added benefits to a service that primarily unlocks streaming services from around the world.

CyberGhost VPN is a perfect example of a service that offers a wide range of advanced security services, but shines when it comes to unlocking sites like Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+.

CyberGhost VPN features AES 256-bit encryption, DNS and IP leak protection, and an automatic kill switch, but crucially provides access to over 6,000 servers worldwide with unlimited bandwidth. It also maintains dedicated streaming servers that are specially optimised for speed, reliability, and location. This makes it a strong pick for anyone looking to unlock American Netflix.

An 18-month subscription to CyberGhost VPN is on sale for £2.15 per month as of Oct. 16, saving you 79% on list price. This plan includes an extra six months for free and a generous 45-day money-back guarantee.

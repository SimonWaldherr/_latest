David Patchett, 36, from Oxford, was the first person on the scene of the crash after hearing a “loud explosion” that shook his narrow boat.

“Other boaters in the area thought it was a sonic boom, it was an epic sound, it was enough to make your heart jump,” he said.

“I grabbed my phone and shoes and ran out at full pelt down the road while trying to dial 999. I knew it wasn’t a good sound.

“The first thing I saw was the lorry on the wrong side of the road and saw the driver was sat there okay. I continued running towards the car, that’s where I could have collapsed to my knees.

“The car was in the middle of the road, it wasn’t just front-end damage it looked like it had been crumpled like a can.

“While I was on the phone to police, the man regained consciousness and that’s when I started screaming down the phone ‘get someone here now.’"

Neighbours revealed yesterday that the Powell family had suffered "tragedy after tragedy,” having been forced to move out of their home following a devastating house fire a few months ago.

One said: “They were a lovely family. They were renting somewhere else in Chinnor in the meantime because there was a house fire, as you can see the whole house is boarded up. It is a devastating shame.”

Sgt Dominic Mahon said officers were in the very early stages of the investigation into what he described as an "incredibly tragic" and "horrendous" incident.

He appealed for help from the public, urging motorists who had dash-cam footage of the incident or either of the vehicles just beforehand, to contact police.

"We will leave no stone unturned to ascertain what has caused this tragedy,” he said.

At Chinnor Community Church, a cross was erected in the family’s memory.

Despite the proposed ban on hybrids along with conventional petrol- and diesel-engined cars by 2035, or possibly even within 10 years, this type of electrified (although not fully electric) vehicle is continuing to grow in popularity.

The reasons are many. Despite the exponential growth in the sales of fully electric cars (EVs) in the past few years as more – and much better – models become available, buyers are understandably suspicious. The chief concerns are range anxiety (the perceived limited distance a car can travel without the need to recharge) and a reliance on the UK's somewhat patchy recharging infrastructure.

These concerns are likely to persist. Which is where hybrids come in, as a useful "halfway house" between the internal combustion engine and fully electric propulsion.

For the manufacturers, hybrids represent a relatively easy way to reduce emissions without the monumental expense (and time) required to engineer and build an all-new range of electric vehicles, as Volkswagen is doing with its battery-only ID range, for example.

I already own a hybrid. Should I be worried?

If you are concerned about the ban, and the potential effect on the used value of your car, the advice is simple: don’t be.

There is no need to sell, or worry about a drop in used value. The proposed ban is still 15 years in the future – by which time most people will have bought another two cars, which are likely to be fully electric (assuming that if you own a hybrid already you’re well down the path to full electrification, while the range of fully electric cars available within even 10 years will make most of today’s look antediluvian).

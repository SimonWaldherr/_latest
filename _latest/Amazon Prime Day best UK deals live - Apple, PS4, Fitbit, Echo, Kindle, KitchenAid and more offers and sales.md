Amazon Prime Day – one of the internet’s biggest shopping events – is under way.

The sale, which was postponed from July until today due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, will see more than one million deals up for grabs from a host of big-name brands including Philips, Toshiba, Lego, Nintendo, Samsung, and Sony.

Last year, the retailer said it sold more than 175 million products and dubbed the sale the “largest shopping event in Amazon history,” as it surpassed results from the previous Black Friday and Cyber Monday events combined.

On the first day, some of the best-selling items were games consoles with offers on the Nintendo Switch and PS4, selling out within a matter of hours.

But the scale of the second wave is still a far-cry from the darkest days of the spring, when at least 100,000 Britons were catching the virus every day.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Government data also shows deaths have risen again, up from the 50 laboratory-confirmed fatalities posted last week. Mondays are always affected by a recording lag that means dozens of victims are not added to the tally until later in the week.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And coronavirus-related hospital admissions in Britain leapt up to 988 on October 15, the most recent day figures are available for, up from 676 last Monday. For comparison, they had dropped below 100 during the summer and were as high as 3,500 at the end of March and start of April.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes as Wales today announced a 'circuit breaker' lockdown, with bars, restaurants and non-essential shops facing closure for a fortnight. Labour's First Minister Mark Drakeford said the draconian move will take effect from 6pm on Friday and argued&#160;that failure to act now would mean 'more people will die'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tories criticised the draconian move, claiming that it doomed Wales to an endless cycle of two-week lockdowns and calling the 'fire-breaker' a 'blunt instrument'. They also lashed out at Mr Drakeford, accusing him of 'small man syndrome'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the move will heap pressure on Boris Johnson who has been desperately resisting the option in England despite backing from his own SAGE experts. Northern Ireland and Scotland have already introduce their own national crackdowns amid spiking cases, but the PM has been sticking to his plan for local 'Tiers'.</p><img id="i-2dbf59b4e2c1c407" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="573" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-2dbf59b4e2c1c407" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/16/34578082-8855987-image-a-10_1603121551421.jpg" height="573" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-59705a020408bd96" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="573" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-59705a020408bd96" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/16/34578088-8855987-image-a-12_1603121560175.jpg" height="573" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">THE OTHER COVID-19 DEATH TOLL: 26,000 MORE DEATHS THAN USUAL IN PRIVATE HOMES SINCE MARCH</h3> <img id="i-f75c205403178845" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="230" width="422" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f75c205403178845" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/16/34566642-8855987-image-a-2_1603121090559.jpg" height="230" width="422" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At least 26,000 more people than usual have died at home during the coronavirus pandemic in England and Wales potentially because they couldn't or didn't want to go to hospital, according to official statistics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Between March 20, the week lockdown started, and September 11, a total of 86,000 people died in private homes rather than in hospitals or care homes, an Office for National Statistics report revealed today.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">In other developments today, the Government warned that Greater Manchester's hospitals are on track to be overwhelmed by October 28 unless the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The region could use up all its intensive care capacity by that date, and demand will pass the previous peak by November 2, according to the latest estimates. Even the 'surge' fallback will be overrun four days later than that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downing Street highlighted the grim assessment, based on the SPI-M group's 'best case' scenario that cases are doubling every 14 days, amid bitter wrangling with mayor Andy Burnham and local MPs over whether to impose 'Tier Three' lockdown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ministers have sent an ultimatum to Mr Burnham and mutinous MPs that they must do a deal on Tier Three lockdown today - or face being forced into the tougher curbs as early as tomorrow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick warned that talks had gone on 'too long' and urged the region to accept a package of funding worth up to &#163;100million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Haggling is also continuing with Nottingham and Yorkshire over the possibility of shifting to Tier Three, which could put a total of seven million more people under heightened restrictions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But along with the war of words with Mr Burnham and Labour, the row is also at risk of tearing the Conservative Party apart - as local MPs including 1922 committee chair Sir Graham Brady dismiss the need for the highest levels of restrictions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a brutal response from 'Red Wall' MPs on Tory WhatsApp groups after colleagues from Tier One sent a letter to Mr Burnham urging him to 'engage' with the Government's regional approach in order to spare other areas 'pain'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The intervention - which many believe was orchestrated by Downing Street - sparked furious private rows about an 'all-round shafting', with one MP reportedly jibing at another: 'You just want a promotion and you're happy to throw colleagues under a bus to achieve it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Jenrick said: 'I do think it is very clear that having now discussed this for well over a week this does now need to be brought to a conclusion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think everybody in Greater Manchester would agree with that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So, I am hopeful that either today, or tomorrow, we will reach a conclusion, one way or the other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mr Burnham was still signalling defiance today, telling journalists: 'It's not about the size of the cheque, it's about protecting low-paid workers, people who are self-employed and supporting businesses.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool City Region received &#163;30million in support for local businesses when it went into Tier Three, along with &#163;14million for extra contact tracing capacity, and &#163;7million when it entered Tier Two.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adjusting the total package for the larger population in Manchester would give a figure of around &#163;95million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although Mr Burnham has been pushing for furlough to be paid at 80 per cent rather than the two-thirds offered by the government, that is met centrally and separate from the bailouts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Projections produced by the Government suggested Manchester's hospitals risked being overwhelmed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Cases in Greater Manchester continue to rise,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In the over-60 age group cases have tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data &#8211; there were 89 cases per 100,000 on September 27 compared to 282 per 100,000 on October 12.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Hospital admissions in Greater Manchester are doubling every nine days.'</p><img id="i-523b7384f196bb19" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="582" width="470" alt="Boris Johnson (pictured in Downing Street today) is struggling to contain an increase in coronavirus cases in the UK" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-523b7384f196bb19" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/15/34568534-8854575-Boris_Johnson_pictured_in_Downing_Street_today_is_struggling_to_-a-30_1603118573401.jpg" height="582" width="470" alt="Boris Johnson (pictured in Downing Street today) is struggling to contain an increase in coronavirus cases in the UK" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-198780c0bddd25c0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="582" width="470" alt="Andy Burnham" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-198780c0bddd25c0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/15/34570322-8854575-image-m-29_1603118565279.jpg" height="582" width="470" alt="Andy Burnham" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="clear"></p><p class="imageCaption">Boris Johnson (pictured in Downing Street today) is struggling to contain an increase in coronavirus cases in the UK.

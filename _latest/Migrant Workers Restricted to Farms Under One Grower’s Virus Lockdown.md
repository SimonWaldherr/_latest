  Migrant Workers Restricted to Farms Under One Grower’s Virus Lockdown 
description: > 
  The large tomato enterprise has been able to impose the restrictions on its workers because they are beholden to the company for their visa, housing and wages.Invited to the United States under one of the country’s only remaining temporary worker programs, employees who refuse to comply could face the cancellation of their contracts and immediate expulsion from the country.“In years past, when we didn’t work, we were free to go to the beach, visit friends,” said Oscar, 36, who worked in the United States to pay his ailing wife’s medical bills.“Now, they don’t let us go anywhere.”Agriculture workers are especially vulnerable to infection.Major outbreaks have been reported from vegetable and fruit farms in Florida and California to meat and produce packing plants in South Dakota and Washington.

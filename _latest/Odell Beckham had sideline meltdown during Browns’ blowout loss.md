<div><p>Odell Beckham Jr. lost his cool on the sidelines again.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Browns wide receiver was removed from Sunday&#8217;s 38-7 loss in Pittsburgh along with quarterback Baker Mayfield and other starters in the fourth quarter. Beckham had to be calmed down by an assistant coach after throwing down his helmet, punching a cooler and taking off his cleats and gloves, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2020/10/a-frustrated-odell-beckham-jr-slams-down-his-helmet-punches-a-cooler-and-throws-off-his-cleats-late-in-38-7-loss-to-the-steelers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Cleveland.com</a>.</p>
<p>The former Giants star wasn&#8217;t made available to the media after the game, but Browns coach Kevin Stefanski called the outburst &#8220;just normal frustration when you come out and you get beat like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beckham, who hadn&#8217;t practiced Thursday or Friday last week <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/odell-beckham-jr-cleared-for-browns-return-after-covid-19-scare/">due to an illness</a>, finished the game with only two receptions for 25 yards. Mayfield had only 119 passing yards and was intercepted twice before backup Case Keenum replaced him in the fourth quarter.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all very frustrated,&#8221; Mayfield said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t come out here just to get stats and do all that. We come out here to win. It&#8217;s a frustrating loss for us knowing that we just didn&#8217;t play well and let a great team capitalize on all those mistakes that we made. We&#8217;re all frustrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following Mayfield&#8217;s second INT of the first half, including a 33-yard pick-six by Minkah Fitzpatrick, Beckham was shown having an animated discussion with his offensive teammates on the Cleveland sideline.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all invested,&#8221; wide receiver Jarvis Landry said. &#8220;I think the thing for us is that we have to figure out a way as a team and as a group&#8230; (Beckham) brought us together as a leader of this team there right before halftime and after halftime and was just kind of talking and positive messaging. He was trying to get us going because we couldn&#8217;t get in any type of rhythm. If that&#8217;s all you guys saw, then that&#8217;s why I am sure I got the question.&#8221;</p>

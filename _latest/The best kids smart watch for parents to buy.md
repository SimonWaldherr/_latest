It is a truth universally acknowledged that a child viewing his parent’s gadgets must be in want of his own. If you’ve got something cool, you can guarantee it won’t be long before they’re either taking yours or demanding their own.

Smartwatches and fitness trackers are the latest tech products finding a younger audience – although not without attracting controversy. In Germany, children’s smartwatches are banned due to fears they could be hacked. Meanwhile fitness trackers for kids have been criticised for leading children to start calorie counting at a young age. Then there are the accusations of helicopter parents using smartwatches to track their children at all times.

Still, enthusiasm for the gadgets is clearly there, because tech brands continue to plug away with the kiddy wrist gadgets. Many of these take the generalised criticism on board and build in measures to quell anxiety that the watches can do more harm than good. The best smartwatches for kids are carefully designed with both the child and his or her parents in mind.

Here's what I found while testing and reviewing a range of the best kids smart watches for parents to buy, starting with my favourites...

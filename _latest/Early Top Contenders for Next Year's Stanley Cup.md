  Early Top Contenders for Next Year's Stanley Cup 
description: > 
  They're young, fast and girded with postseason experience, and if their goaltending holds up, they'll at the very least be a tough out in the next tournament.There's stability, albeit unproven stability, in the net with Tristan Jarry signed and a lot of dead salary weight culled from the roster.St. Louis BluesThe Blues were champs in 2018-19 and second overall in the regular season last last time around, but they seem farther away now than they were at this stage before 2019-20.Exchanging free agent Alex Pietrangelo for Torey Krug presumably adds offensive pop to the blue line but it could come at the expense of defensive prowess and overall team toughness.Would it be a shock if they were in the Cup Final next year?

Barnes/Associated Press</p><p class=""><strong><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/dallas-stars">Dallas Stars</a></strong></p><p class="">No offense to Lone Star State hockey fans, but it was a short line of people who expected the Stars to get within two games of a championship last season. And though they took out the second-seeded <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/colorado-avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> and top-seeded <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/vegas-golden-knights">Vegas Golden Knights</a> along the way, they're still more of an outsider than an insider when it comes to next season's title talk. Experience helps, but a repeat seems a long shot.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/new-york-islanders">New York Islanders</a></strong></p><p class="">Tied for 14th in the regular season, the Islanders were among the big boys in the playoffs, defeating the top-seeded <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/philadelphia-flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> in the Eastern Conference semifinals before pushing the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning to six games. They're young, fast and girded with postseason experience, and if their goaltending holds up, they'll at the very least be a tough out in the next tournament.&#160;</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/pittsburgh-penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a></strong></p><p class="">Call it an emeritus selection, but any team with the Penguins' championship experience, not to mention 30-something studs like <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/sidney-crosby">Sidney Crosby</a> and Evgeni Malkin, will be a factor when the games matter again. There's stability, albeit unproven stability, in the net with Tristan Jarry signed and a lot of dead salary weight culled from the roster. If they're healthy when playoff time rolls around, keep an eye on them.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>St. Louis <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/st-louis-blues">Blues</a></strong></p><p class="">The Blues were champs in 2018-19 and second overall in the regular season last last time around, but they seem farther away now than they were at this stage before 2019-20.

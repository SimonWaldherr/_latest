Saturday’s round of wild college football games with a few unexpected results caused considerable shakeup in the Amway Coaches Poll, though Clemson and Alabama continue to lead the way.

Clemson strengthened its hold on the No. 1 ranking after dispatching then-No. 7 Miami (Fla.) in convincing fashion. The Tigers received 55 of 62 first-place votes this week, extending its lead over the Crimson Tide to 65 poll points. The Hurricanes were demoted to No. 12.

Alabama retained five firsts and is still solidly at No. 2, though they needed all the offensive firepower they could muster to stave off unranked Mississippi.

Georgia, which heads to Alabama next week, now holds the No. 3 position alone after the Bulldogs pulled away from Tennessee and Florida fell to Texas A&M. Notre Dame, which got back on the field and held off Florida State, climbs to fourth. Ohio State returns to the top five two weeks before the Big Ten’s highly anticipated debut.

North Carolina, a winner in a high-scoring affair with Virginia Tech, moves up to No. 6, its highest ranking since 1998 during Mack Brown’s first coaching stint in Chapel Hill.

Florida, meanwhile, slips to No. 9 while the Aggies vault nine positions to No. 11, a couple of notches higher than they were rated before losing to Alabama.

Oklahoma State, the last unbeaten team in the Big 12, moves up three places to No. 7 following an open date. Penn State holds steady at No. 8 and Cincinnati rounds out the top 10.

Among the notable dropouts is defending national champion LSU. The Tigers fell to 1-2 thanks to Missouri’s late goal-line stand and fall out of the Top 25 for the first time since October of 2017. T

Texas also drops from the rankings with its four-overtime loss to Red River rival Oklahoma. The news wasn’t all bad for the Big 12, however, as Kansas State joins the poll at No. 22.

<p>&#8220;Tiger King&#8221; star and &#8220;Dancing With the Stars&#8221; contestant Carole Baskin has come out as bisexual.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always considered myself to be bisexual,&#8221; Baskin, 59, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/10/19/carole-baskin-bisexual-lgbt-sexuality-big-cat-rescue-joe-exotic-tiger-king-aids-crisis-dancing-with-the-stars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told PinkNews via video</a>. &#8220;Even though I&#8217;ve never had a wife, I could just as easily have a wife as a husband &#8230; I just don&#8217;t see us as being different genders or different colors, or different anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baskin told the outlet she came to the realization while engaged to a psychologist immersed in the LGBTQ community at the heights of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, saying, &#8220;I became very close to people in that community then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baskin added that, growing up, she was &#8220;always very male-oriented in the things I did,&#8221; explaining that she felt she was &#8220;probably born into the wrong body&#8221; because she was such a &#8220;tomboy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had any mothering instincts or anything,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I never played with dolls. And so I always thought that there was something off there, that I couldn&#8217;t quite put my finger on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if her &#8220;Tiger King&#8221; co-star and now-imprisoned foe Joe Exotic was a good representative of the queer community, Baskin said, &#8220;I think he&#8217;s an embarrassment to the human community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a matter of what your sexuality is, this man is just a deviant in the way that he treats human life and animal life.&#8221;</p>

Governors have questions.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A student pharmacist preparing a dose of flu vaccine in Los Angeles on Saturday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With the first coronavirus vaccines in the final stages of testing, the National Governors Association has some pressing questions for the Trump administration: Who is going to pay for the administration of vaccines? And how will scarce supplies be allocated among the states?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The association, a bipartisan group headed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/national-governors-association-submits-list-questions-trump-administration-effective" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted its questions</a> on Twitter.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Will there be additional funding allocated to states to assist with distribution of the vaccine and other vaccine efforts?&#8221; the group asked.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And what, they asked, is the national plan to deal with vaccine shortages?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There were also questions about the mundane supplies needed to immunize people &#8212; needles, syringes, alcohol pads, adhesive bandages, dry ice. How will they be managed, the governors ask.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The need for a vaccine is so large and so urgent that there will almost certainly not be enough to go around, at least at first. And it is not clear how the vaccine supplies will be doled out. Will they be allocated to each state based on total population, or according to the number of people at the highest risk of infection, or by some other rubric?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The question of who should be vaccinated once the states receive supplies has been studied intensively by several groups, including the National Academies of Science and Medicine, which proposed dividing the population into groups based on risk and need.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The first group to be offered a vaccine would be emergency, public safety and health care workers, including those employed in nursing homes. Next would be people with medical conditions that place them at high risk for severe infections, and older people living in group homes or crowded neighborhoods.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">From there the lists move on to less and less vulnerable groups, ending with healthy children and young adults. Lastly, anyone not included in one of the specified groups would then be offered a vaccine.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A federal Centers for Disease Control and Preventions committee said it favored the National Academies&#8217; approach, but would hold an emergency meeting to vote on a final plan once a vaccine was ready and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. From there, it would be up to the C.D.C. to adopt a plan.</p><a class="css-1a9ghz5" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html"><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/18/us/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker-promo-1600439734668/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker-promo-1600439734668-articleLarge-v10.png"><h2 class="css-zd32qr">Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker</h2><p class="css-1uuihdo">A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans.</p></a><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="americans-are-getting-rival-predictions-for-the-pandemic-days-ahead"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#americans-are-getting-rival-predictions-for-the-pandemic-days-ahead">Americans are getting rival predictions for the pandemic days ahead.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/18/business/18virus-briefing-azar/merlin_176090922_59de4234-f9c9-4760-8f36-ddfb15149a02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Oliver Contreras for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As the coronavirus continued to surge in many parts of the United States, officials and experts offered starkly different outlooks on Sunday about what was to come and when the situation might improve.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, noting that many have grown tired of pandemic precautions, tried to paint an optimistic picture of how much longer they would be needed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Hang in there with us,&#8221; he said on Sunday <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-interview-hhs-sec-azar-promises-we-are-weeks-away-from-safe-and-effective-vaccines-94086213705" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the NBC program &#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221;</a> &#8220;We&#8217;re so close.

The public health measures with which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/us/coronavirus-pandemic-fatigue.html" title="">the public is fatigued</a> will be needed for some time to come, even after new drugs and vaccines can be approved, they said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And in the big picture, the numbers are headed the wrong way.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Friday, more than 70,450 new coronavirus cases were reported in the United States, the highest figure since July 24, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">according to a New York Times database</a>, and more than 900 new deaths were recorded. Case counts are rising in 41 of the 50 states, with much of the worst news in the Great Lakes and Great Plains regions.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the public did not know what to believe about how soon a vaccine would be available. And communicating clearly and credibly with the public is just as important as the science, he said, because slowing the spread of the virus depends on individuals taking the right precautions.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The next six to 12 weeks are going to be the darkest of the entire pandemic,&#8221; Dr. Osterholm said on &#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A similar warning was sounded by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, who said on the CBS program &#8220;Face the Nation&#8221; that the country was headed into &#8220;probably the most difficult phase of this epidemic.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I think the next three months are going to be very challenging,&#8221; Dr. Gottlieb said.</p><p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"> </p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melina-delkic" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Melina Delkic</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Gina Kolata</a> and </p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="twitter-removes-a-false-tweet-against-masks-by-white-house-virus-adviser"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#twitter-removes-a-false-tweet-against-masks-by-white-house-virus-adviser">Twitter removes a false tweet against masks by White House virus adviser.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A message against masks posted by a White House pandemic adviser, Scott Atlas, was removed by Twitter.&#160;</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Erin Scott for The New York Times</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Twitter removed a tweet denouncing masks from its service that was posted on Saturday by Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist who serves on President Trump&#8217;s coronavirus task force. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the tweet, Dr. Atlas wrote, &#8220;masks work? NO&#8221; and falsely claimed that the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control did not support their use, and that they cause &#8220;many harms.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Most health authorities are unanimous on the efficacy of wearing masks to curtail the spread of the virus. The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C.D.C. recommends wearing masks</a> &#8220;in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.&#8221; The federal agency adds that masks &#8220;may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">W.H.O. says</a> &#8220;masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Atlas&#8217;s tweet, a Twitter spokeswoman wrote in an email, violated its policy against misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic. That policy, the spokeswoman added, applies to tweets that &#8220;could lead to harm,&#8221; in particular &#8220;statements or assertions that have been confirmed to be false or misleading by subject-matter experts, such as public health authorities.&#8221; </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Atlas&#8217;s stances on the pandemic have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-scott-atlas-coronavirus.html" title="">clashed with those of other members of the </a>White House Task Force, including Dr. Deborah L. Birx and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Although President Trump has disdained the wearing of masks, Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who helped the president prepare for his presidential debates, said he &#8220;was wrong&#8221; not to wear one. Mr. Christie was hospitalized with a coronavirus infection around the same time as Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/chris-christie-face-masks-covid.html" title="">In a statement last week</a>, Mr. Christie wrote, &#8220;I believed when I entered the White House grounds, that I had entered a safe zone, due to the testing that I and many others underwent every day.&#8221; But, he said, &#8220;I was wrong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I hope that my experience shows my fellow citizens that you should follow C.D.C. guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="talks-on-broad-relief-are-stuck-as-time-runs-short-pelosi-says-while-senate-republicans-plan-narrow-bills"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#talks-on-broad-relief-are-stuck-as-time-runs-short-pelosi-says-while-senate-republicans-plan-narrow-bills">Talks on broad relief are stuck as time runs short, Pelosi says, while Senate Republicans plan narrow bills.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during an interview with ABC on Sunday that there was little time left to pass a new economic relief package before Election Day." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/business/17virus-briefing-stimulus-sub/merlin_178697400_e4dde6de-12f6-4438-a29b-68fe7242e71b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during an interview with ABC on Sunday that there was little time left to pass a new economic relief package before Election Day.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Congressional Democrats and the White House remain at an impasse over a fresh package of coronavirus economic relief, as time runs out to get a bill passed before the election, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi said on the ABC program &#8220;This Week&#8221; that she was still in negotiations with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, but that &#8220;we don&#8217;t have agreement on the language yet.&#8221; She said a deal would have to be struck within 48 hours in order for a package to be enacted by Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But even if she and Mr. Mnuchin reach a deal, Senate Republicans are not expected to accept it. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has said he does not believe he can sell a package of more than $1 trillion to conservative Senate Republicans, which is less than half the size of the bill House Democrats have proposed. The Democrats have proposed a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56686" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2.4 trillion package</a>, named the Heroes Act, that would provide aid to families, schools, restaurants, businesses and airline workers; it includes about $500 billion for state and local governments. Mr. Mnuchin, negotiating on behalf of President Trump, has countered with a number of proposed alterations to scale back the package.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Sunday, Mr. Trump said he remained optimistic. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about it. I think Nancy Pelosi maybe is coming along, we&#8217;ll find out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to do it at a bigger number than she wants. That doesn&#8217;t mean all the Republicans agree with me but I think they will in the end if she would go along.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The White House has proposed changes to the Democrats&#8217; proposal, and in a letter to colleagues Sunday afternoon, Ms. Pelosi detailed her objections.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The White House has removed 55 percent of the Heroes Act&#8217;s language for testing, tracing, and treatment,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi wrote. &#8220;Especially disappointing was the elimination of measures to address the virus&#8217;s disproportionate and deadly impact on communities of color. The White House does not appreciate the need to direct resources to culturally competent contact tracing.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She added: &#8220;The Administration continues to fail to meet the well-documented need for funds to protect frontline workers in health care, first responders, sanitation, transportation, food workers, teachers and others, and to prevent service cuts to struggling communities.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Nevertheless, she said, she hoped to find common ground. &#8220;I am optimistic that we can reach agreement before the election,&#8221; she wrote.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell, who has not been negotiating with Ms. Pelosi, is expected to put forward a $500 billion package this week.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell also said on Saturday that he planned to hold votes on a stand-alone bill to revive the Paycheck Protection Program, a federal loan program for small businesses created in the spring. Some of the $500 billion in his relief proposal would be used to finance the loan program.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell has faced pressure from moderate members of his conference to act on relief legislation. President Trump&#8217;s decision to abruptly end talks, and then to reverse course, prompted concerns among Republicans that he had in effect guaranteed that Republicans would be blamed for a failure to provide further federal aid.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Without congressional action and a new round of federal relief, the country&#8217;s economic recovery has continued to shudder, and millions of Americans <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/federal-aid-poverty-levels.html" title="">have slipped back into poverty</a>.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Luke Broadwater</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="new-york-will-allow-ski-resorts-to-reopen-at-reduced-capacity"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#new-york-will-allow-ski-resorts-to-reopen-at-reduced-capacity">New York will allow ski resorts to reopen at reduced capacity.</a></h2><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</p><p class="css-1ceswkc e1drnplw1"></p><p class="css-mln36k" id="modal-title">transcript</p><p class="css-1701swk">bars</p><p class="css-1t7yl1y">0:00 / 0:38</p><p class="css-og85jy">- 0:00</p><p class="css-1qi8px4">transcript</p><h2 class="css-9wqu2x">New York Ski Resorts Can Open, Cuomo Says</h2><h4 class="css-qsd3hm">Gov.

The agency stressed that it had found no evidence that consumers had been infected by handling frozen foods and that the risk of infection to them was &#8220;extremely low.&#8221; </p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sui-Lee Wee</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="new-york-shuts-down-a-wedding-in-brooklyn-amid-fears-it-would-draw-10000-people"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#new-york-shuts-down-a-wedding-in-brooklyn-amid-fears-it-would-draw-10000-people">New York shuts down a wedding in Brooklyn amid fears it would draw 10,000 people.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Congregation Yetev Lev D&#8217;Satmar in Brooklyn.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Kevin Hagen for The New York Times</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A wedding with up 10,000 guests? In Brooklyn, near a coronavirus hot spot?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">No, New York state officials said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The officials have taken extraordinary steps to shut down the ultra-Orthodox wedding planned for Monday, with the state health commissioner personally intervening to have sheriff&#8217;s deputies deliver an order to the Hasidic synagogue where it would take place.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The order, delivered on Friday, warned that the synagogue must follow health protocols, including limiting gatherings to fewer than 50 people.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Sunday, the synagogue, the Congregation Yetev Lev D&#8217;Satmar, accused state officials of &#8220;unwarranted attacks&#8221; on the wedding, at which a grandson of Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, the synagogue&#8217;s rabbi, is to be married. The congregation said that the ceremony and meal would have been restricted to &#8220;close family members,&#8221; and that members of the public would have been invited to participate only &#8220;for a short period of time.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The wedding will continue, the synagogue said, but will be limited to a smaller group of family members.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It&#8217;s sad that nobody verified our plans before attacking us,&#8221; Chaim Jacobowitz, the congregation&#8217;s secretary, said in a statement.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The episode highlighted the brewing tensions between state and local officials the Hasidic community as state health officials try to control surging coronavirus cases in some neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens and in counties north of New York City.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said Sunday that a large wedding was too risky and could have resulted in a so-called superspreader event. State officials said that they determined the wedding, scheduled to take place in Williamsburg, could have had up to 10,000 people in attendance.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;My suggestion: Have a small wedding this year,&#8221; Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference on Sunday. &#8220;Next year, have a big wedding.

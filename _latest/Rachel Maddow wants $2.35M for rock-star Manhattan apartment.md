MSNBC political commentator Rachel Maddow and her partner, Susan Mikula, are listing their Manhattan digs for $2.35 million.

The 2,650-square-foot pad — which the host of “The Rachel Maddow Show” purchased for $1.25 million from REM frontman Michael Stipe in 2010 — is on the West Village’s charming Jane Street. It’s since been renovated and restored.

Brown Harris Stevens broker Mary Vetri has posted a video tour of the two-bedroom, 1½-bathroom co-op, complete with easy listening Muzak, so Maddow fans can get a glimpse of what her lifestyle is like.

All personal touches, however, seem to have been removed; the home is staged, per the Realtor.com listing.

The building, which dates to 1898, was a paper warehouse. It faces a charming cobblestone street, and original details abound inside, from wood columns and exposed brick to a large wood-burning fireplace — along with new, modern details like custom cabinets and hickory wood floors.

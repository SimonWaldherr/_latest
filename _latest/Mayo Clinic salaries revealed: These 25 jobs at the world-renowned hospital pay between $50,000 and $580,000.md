It's the top hospital for adults in <a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals">US News' annual ranking</a>.</p><p>Business Insider used Department of Labor data to get an inside look at compensation at the Mayo Clinic.&#160;</p><p>"Our approach to compensation is similar regardless of location &#8211; we are market-based relative to where we attract talent from for the role," a Mayo Clinic spokesperson said in an email. "There is no information publicly available about how we establish our pay for specific positions."</p><p>All US companies have to disclose how much they pay employees when they hire a foreign worker for a position in the US under a permanent or temporary worker visa. From more than 6,000 visa applications found in the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2019 <a href="https://h1bdata.info/">disclosure data</a>, Business Insider has pulled out data for 258 applications from the Mayo Clinic covering a wide variety of positions, from research fellows and health-systems engineers to nephrologists.</p><p>The data represents only a fraction of Mayo Clinic's full employee base. The data also includes only salaries, leaving out other compensation like incentives and bonus pay.</p><p>The entries below show either a salary or salary range for an employee. Many of the positions are in Minnesota, where Mayo Clinic has its main campus, but some are on campuses in Florida and Arizona. Some positions listed had levels and were consolidated into one job title (for example, informatics specialist I and informatics specialist II were consolidated to informatics specialist).</p><p>This article was published on October 9 and has been updated with a statement from the Mayo Clinic.&#160;</p>

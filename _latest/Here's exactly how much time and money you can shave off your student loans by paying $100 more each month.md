That's because a well-diversified investment portfolio will return about 6% annually, which is less than you'd save in interest payments, she told Erin Lowry in her book, "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143133640/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?tag=bisafetynet2-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broke Millennial Takes on Investing</a>."</p><p>Meanwhile, Alex Benke, vice president of Financial Advice and Planning For <a href="https://betterment.evyy.net/qGZLn">Betterment</a>, told Lowry that <a href="https://betterment.evyy.net/qGZLn">Betterment</a> uses a 5% interest rate as the cut-off for student loan debt.

<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A man whose brain injury left him unable to walk or talk for eight years regained full consciousness 20 minutes after taking the sleeping pill Ambien.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 39-year-old from Amsterdam - referred to only as Richard in the medical journal Cortex -&#160;was diagnosed with akinetic mutism at age 29. He suffered the rare mental disorder after choking on a piece of meat, which starved his brain of oxygen and robbed him of his ability to perform basic tasks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Richard was only able to respond to questions or commands by making gestures with his eyes, but did not move voluntarily and had to be fed through a tube.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Doctors said they decided to give him zolpidem -&#160;sold in the UK as Stilnoct, and in the US as Ambien - as a last resort, following reports of the sleeping pill temporarily curing patients of paralysis in studies around the world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within 20 minutes Richard&#160;was able to walk with the help of his carers and phone his father, who had not heard his son's voice in nearly a decade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing in the journal, medics said giving Richard the drug once a day could keep him alert for two hours.&#160;But the medication would start to lose its impact if taken for five days on the trot because his body would become tolerant of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Akinetic mutism&#160;does not physically paralyse people, but it slows their mental function down so much that the brain struggles to send signals to the body to move, talk or eat. Researchers believe Ambien helps reopen these pathways.</p><p class="vjs-video-container vjs-fixed vjs-span-two-col health" id="v-7252208306379636832">    </p> <img id="i-4721d9187b80e22d" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="399" width="634" alt="A 39-year-old patients from the Netherlands - referred to only as Richard (right) in medical journal Cortex - was diagnosed with akinetic mutism at age 29.&#160;&#160;He suffered the rare mental disorder after choking on a piece of meat, which starved his brain of oxygen" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-4721d9187b80e22d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/10/34563710-8854477-image-a-1_1603099067791.jpg" height="399" width="634" alt="A 39-year-old patients from the Netherlands - referred to only as Richard (right) in medical journal Cortex - was diagnosed with akinetic mutism at age 29.&#160;&#160;He suffered the rare mental disorder after choking on a piece of meat, which starved his brain of oxygen" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">A 39-year-old patients from the Netherlands - referred to only as Richard (right) in medical journal Cortex - was diagnosed with akinetic mutism at age 29.&#160;&#160;He suffered the rare mental disorder after choking on a piece of meat, which starved his brain of oxygen</p><img id="i-b172493db57ebcdc" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="284" width="306" alt="Ambien is one of the most commonly prescribed in the US, outselling painkillers such as Percocet and maximum strength ibuprofen" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-b172493db57ebcdc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/12/34566426-8854477-Ambien_is_one_of_the_most_commonly_prescribed_in_the_US_outselli-a-1_1603107170449.jpg" height="284" width="306" alt="Ambien is one of the most commonly prescribed in the US, outselling painkillers such as Percocet and maximum strength ibuprofen" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Ambien is one of the most commonly prescribed in the US, outselling painkillers such as Percocet and maximum strength ibuprofen</p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">HOW DID AMBIEN TREAT HIS INCURABLE CONDITION?&#160;</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Richard suffers from a condition known as akinetic mutism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scans show that parts of Richard&#8217;s brain shut down because of sensory overload whenever he tries to perform a basic task.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite having the will and awareness to want to eat, speak or move, his brain injury blocks signals being sent to his body to carry out the tasks.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zolpidem, sold as Ambien in the US, works as a medication for sleep by slowing down activity in the brain, allowing it to rest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers believe Ambien helps prevent sensory overload and free up these information pathways.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Giving Richard the drug once a day could keep him alert for two hours.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the medication loses its impact if taken for five days on the trot because the body becomes used to it, according to the doctors treating Richard.&#160;</p><p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_1"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Willemijn van Erp, a doctoral student at Radboud University, was training to become a doctor in elderly care when she met Richard at a specialised nursing home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said Richard's family agreed to administer Ambien because his situation 'seemed hopeless' and no other medications had any effect.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within 20 minutes, Richard&#160;had asked his nurse how to operate his wheelchair, walked assisted by his carers, requested fast food and phoned his father.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The drug's effects lasted about two hours before he would slip back out of consciousness.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His medical team have had to become selective about when they medicate Richard because his body starts to become tolerant of the drug after five days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They said: 'On average, it would require two to three medication-free weeks to notice the effects of a single dose of zolpidem again. Consequently, administration was restricted to special occasions.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scans show, following his accident in 2012, parts of Richard's brain appear to shut down because of sensory overload whenever he tries to perform a basic task.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hisse Arnts, a researcher from Amsterdam University Medical Centre who has been caring for Richard, said:'You could compare the brain, as it were, to a large string orchestra.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'With Richard, the first violins play so loud that they drown out the other members of the string orchestra and people can no longer hear each other.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Zolpidem ensures that these first violins play more "pianissimo", so that everyone back within time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Administering this sleeping medication can suppress this unwanted brain overactivity, creating space for speech and movement.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Previous studies have indicated that about one in 20 patients with consciousness disorders given Ambien see their condition improve, at least temporarily.

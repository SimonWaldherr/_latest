More now from Republican chair Ronna McDaniel’s interview with ABC, the one in which, depressingly predictably, she declined to condemn the QAnon conspiracy theory. Which… tells you a lot about the Republican base.

McDaniel was also asked about a spat between Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, one of the GOP figures with an eye on a White House run in 2024, and the man in the Oval Office now, Donald J Trump. This is some of what Sasse told his constituents about Trump this week:

It isn’t just that he fails to lead our allies, it’s that we – the United States now regularly sells out our allies under his leadership. The way he treats women and spends like a – a drunken sailor. The ways I criticized President Obama for that kind of spending, I’ve criticized President Trump for as well. He mocks evangelicals behind closed doors. His – his family has treated the presidency like a business opportunity. He flirted with white supremacists.

Sasse also said he feared a Republican “bloodbath” in the Senate – which Democrats look likely to retake. Oddly enough, McDaniel wasn’t having it:

“Everything that Ben Sasse said in that recording does not resemble the president that has lead our country out of this pandemic. He’s lead us to a great economy before this. … And the president has unprecedented approval with the Republican party.

“Ben’s been there for a long time. It’s not surprising. It’s the only time he gets news is when he criticises this president. But the party, and the energy we’re seeing on the ground, and the rallies, and what we’re seeing for this president is unprecedented in terms of the support he’s receiving from Republicans across the country.”

Implausibly, but also entirely to standard for election year boilerplate, McDaniel also said she was “not worried about Washington Beltway politics”. Asked if she was “starting to see Republican senators running on a separate track from President Trump?”, she said: “I’m not. I think all of them have been running those similar races along.

“Here’s what I’m going to tell you. I am seeing more enthusiasm than I saw in 2016. I study the data every day. We know that our voters are going to turn out on election day. They don’t trust the mail-in balloting as much. They are getting out in these early vote states right now. We want them to get out. We want them to turn in their absentee votes.

“But we are seeing this huge energy and we are seeing really great numbers coming out for the president. And this is a race. And any Republican that doesn’t recognize that running with the president is going to help them is hurting themselves in the long run.”

But that reduction, the report said, was offset by a rise in "light goods vehicles" &#8212; the delivery vans that ensure your Amazon packages turn up on time, as well as services like Uber.</p><p>"We see that many of the of the Outer London boroughs have seen increases in LGV [van] traffic of more than 10% over the last twenty years, with particular growth in the boroughs north of the river," the authors wrote.</p><p>Delivery vans made up about 20% of all London road usage in 2017, <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/londonassembly/meetings/documents/s62403/Appendix%202%20-%20Draft%20Transcript%20of%20Item%204b-Questions%20to%20the%20Mayor.pdf">according to remarks by London mayor Sadiq Khan</a>.</p><p>In Paris, mayor Anne Hidalgo <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-27/paris-wants-a-tax-to-cover-amazon-delivery-impacts">is reportedly considering a tax</a> on Amazon and other firms whose delivery services create congestion.</p>

The British-built DBS is blisteringly fast and even more desirable in open-top form. However, a V12-engined supercar may soon be a thing of the past. So what’s it like as day-to-day transport?

The DBS Volante is a convertible GT powered by a 5.2-litre V12 engine. The coupé version is also one of four Aston Martin models that will appear in the delayed James Bond film No Time To Die, now scheduled for November release following its postponement due to Covid-19.

Launched in 2019, the 5.2-litre Superleggera – that’s Italian for super light – is just the sort of grand tourer for cruising across the Continent, or posing around a Mediterranean bolthole during the summer months.

For the rest of us, enjoying any convertible in the UK really requires a keen eye on the weather app and a willingness to accept that most of the open-top experience will involve a scarf and hat.

With a few options fitted, the DBS Volante easily tops £250,000, which is a considerable outlay to boost your levels of Vitamin D. That’s especially true when the DB11 convertible is about £90,000 cheaper and the all-new Vantage Roadster half the price.

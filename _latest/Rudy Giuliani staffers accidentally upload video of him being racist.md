Rudy Giuliani mocked Asian people in a racist video that appeared to have been uploaded to his YouTube channel by mistake.

The Republican took-on a stereotypical Asian accent and bowed in a racist manner in the video that was uploaded on Wednesday night.

According to the Daily Beast, the remarks were made on Tuesday, when Mr Giuliani had interviewed former White House press secretary Sean Spicer for his podcast, Common Sense.

On Wednesday night, two versions of that interview were reported to have been uploaded to YouTube, which included an extended scene in which Mr Giuliani was racist.

It showed Mr Spicer leave the room, before several minutes of darkness are followed by Mr Giuliani, who starts speaking to staff who are not on camera.

Seemingly unaware that he is being recorded, the Republican names his assistant and conservative YouTuber Jayne Zirkle, and says she’s “going to be the most famous model in China.”

“Ah, get me Jayne Zirkle,” he adds, with an accent. “What would you like to have for dinner? Jayne Zirkle”

Mr Giuliani then continued to repeat “Jayne Zirkle” as he bowed and laughed at his own imitation.

The controversial Republcan has made mistakes in the past, which included an accidental call to NBC News reporter Rich Shapiro, who in October 2019 overheard a voice message about money problems.

Democratic congressman Ted Lieu was among those who denounced both Mr Giuliani and president Trump following the video.

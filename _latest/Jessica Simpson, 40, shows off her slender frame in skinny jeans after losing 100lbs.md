Jessica Simpson is as slim as she was in the 1990s when she was a singer married to Nick Lachey.

And the 40-year-old fashion designer has been having fun showing off her 100lb weight loss after three kids with husband Eric Johnson.

This weekend the blonde beauty was seen in her skinny jeans as she tried to ride a bicycle in platform heels: 'Trying my hardest to feel peaceful riding my 7yr old sons bike. You can’t see them, but you know I’ve got 5-inch platforms on to reach the pavement for grounding.'

The star had on a black top with skintight jeans from her Jessica Simpson Collection.

Though her shoes could not be seen that well it appears as if she had on her high heeled platform boots in black from her own line.

And the Employee Of The Month actress added a floppy maroon hat with sunglasses and hoop earrings as she made a peace sign.

Last week the versatile star shared an image to Instagram where she was showing off her sculpted body in workout clothing.

The Dukes Of Hazzard actress was seen in a plunging keyhole bra top and leggings for a yoga session in the backyard of her $11.5M Hidden Hills, California mansion.

This comes nearly three weeks after the mother-of-three was seen doing a warrior pose in the same outfit.

In this new post, her JS Collection team urges fans to work out with her. 'Want to workout with Team JS?! We are back with LIVE weekly workouts led by @tianasegalasfit right here on Instagram! Starting next MONDAY AT 1PM EST, stay tuned to our Stories for more!'

Simpson is proud of her shape after working out again and giving up alcohol. She lost 100lbs last year after giving birth to her third child, Birdie Mae.

Tipping the scale at about 240lbs following the birth of Birdie Mae in March 2019, Simpson turned to her longtime trainer Harley Pasternak for help in reclaiming her body after having delivered three children in eight years.

Strong lady: She said: 'Starting the week with a warrior mindset aligned with the beauty of the sunset.' This image was shared in September

Her routine centered on five daily tasks: getting in her walking steps, exercise, eating healthy, getting at least seven hours of sleep and unplugging from technology for an hour.

'The difference between this and the other times was that she worked out, yes, but her transformation was more about what she did on her own time,” Pasternak told People.

'She was so motivated and positive. She was saying that her body has not belonged to her for the past decade. Not in a bad way, in a positive way — her body has been designated to create life and now it's hers again and she's going to make it fantastic in a really enjoyable way.'

Simpson has been married to former NFL player Eric Johnson since July 2014. They also are the proud parents to eight-year-old daughter Maxi and seven-year-old son Ace.

In her last yoga post, she said: 'Starting the week with a warrior mindset aligned with the beauty of the sunset.'

Simpson made reference to the sunset in the backdrop as well as the warrior II pose -- Virabhadrasana (veer-uh-buh-DRAHS-uh-nuh), which was named after Virabhadra, a fierce mythological Hindu warrior and incarnation of Shiva.

Simpson not only makes yoga a priority in her everyday routine, she has also turned it into a lucrative business by selling activewear through her signature clothing line, Jessica Simpson Collection.

Since launching in 2005 as a shoe collaboration with Nine West co-founder Vince Camuto, the company has diversified into clothing, handbags, sunglasses, accessories, jewelry, shoes and fragrances, among others. The Jessica Simpson Collection has been hauling in over $1 billion a year in revenue since 2010.

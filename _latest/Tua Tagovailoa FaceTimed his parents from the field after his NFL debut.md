<div><p>Tua Tagovailoa finally saw NFL game action on Sunday, and he made sure to share the milestone with his family.</p>
<p>Shortly after the former Alabama quarterback made his NFL debut for the Miami Dolphins late in <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/jets-report-card-lost-and-listless-in-loss-to-dolphins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their 24-0 victory over the winless Jets</a>, Tagovailoa sat at the 15-yard line at Hard Rock Stadium and FaceTimed his parents, Diane and Galu.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest thing that really stands out to me is just being able to make my parents proud,&#8221; Tagovailoa said after the game. &#8220;Whether that&#8217;s Tua as a football player, Tua as a person, Tua as a son, I think that&#8217;s what brings me the most joy is seeing how happy my parents get and then seeing how happy my family gets, as well, with who I am and also what I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tagovailoa, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/how-the-dolphins-plan-to-use-tua-tagovailoa-as-a-rookie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the fifth overall pick in the 2020 draft</a>, replaced Ryan Fitzpatrick with the game in hand with 2:27 remaining. It was more than 11 months after the lefty quarterback had suffered a season-ending hip injury for the Crimson Tide last November.</p>
 
<p>Fitzpatrick even pumped both arms above his head to encourage the home crowd to cheer louder, and fans chanted &#8220;Tua&#8221; as he entered the game. The 22-year-old Tagovailoa completed both of his pass attempts for nine yards before running out the clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was just a cool moment for him, just the reception from the crowd that was here and from us on the sideline,&#8221; Fitzpatrick said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely could hear it. There&#8217;s nothing else playing in the stadium, so I could hear that. And that was awesome,&#8221; Tagovailoa added. &#8220;But to just be out there with my teammates, being my first time, and getting the support and love from them, I think that was super awesome.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then you have a 16-year vet like Fitz, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/05/tua-tagovailoa-dolphins-time-is-close-and-ryan-fitzpatrick-is-ready/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has no animosity toward it</a>, as well, who&#8217;s just been supportive the entire time. Good drive, bad drive, he comes to the sideline and just talks through his process with why he did some things. I&#8217;m very fortunate to have a mentor like him who is just very encouraging on the field and then this guy is, like, he&#8217;s just very personable off the field, as well.&#8221;</p>

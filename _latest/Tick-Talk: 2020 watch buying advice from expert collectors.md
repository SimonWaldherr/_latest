<p><strong>My first watch:</strong>&#160;A self-winding chronograph with a black dial and no brand name, but I loved it. Actually, I still<br>
have it.</p>
<p><strong>Why wearing a great watch still matters:</strong> A watch remains a strong social marker. Mastering time is what makes mankind rise.</p>
<p><strong>Advice for first-time buyers</strong>: Price is hardly the only thing. Find a specialist, a trusted dealer or an auction house. Knowledge takes time.</p>
<p><strong>Best watch to gift:</strong> The watch has to represent the person. To my wife, I offered a very rare Cartier Tonneau Jumbo [$68,500]: timeless and elegant.</p>
<p><strong>Best watch to start a collection:</strong> A Rolex Air-King, GMT [GMT-Master II, top left, $39,900] or Explorer I. They are safe values, both classic and elegant &#8212; the companion of a lifetime. I would also recommend a Cartier Tank. It represents perfectly the &#8220;chic &#224; la fran&#231;aise.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Celeb watch icon:</strong> The Rolex GMT of Che Guevara, which is a milestone not only in the history of watchmaking, but also in the human adventure. And the Breguet Type XX of Serge Gainsbourg, the French singer.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite watch book:</strong> &#8220;Wristwatches&#8221; by Gisbert Brunner and Christian Pfeiffer-Belli.</p>

<p><strong>My first watch:</strong>&#160;A Casio G-Shock given by my parents when I was 10.<br>
Why wearing a great watch still matters: A watch is like an extension of yourself. If you wear a vintage piece, it has a story behind it, which opens opportunities to connect with people.</p>
<p><strong>Advice for first-time buyers:</strong> Don&#8217;t pay high premiums for hyped models on social media. Buy what truly fascinates you and speaks to your personal aesthetics and needs.</p>
<p><strong>Best watch to gift:</strong> If budget allows, a vintage Patek Philippe Ref. 2526 for dad.</p>
<p><strong>Watch I&#8217;m coveting:</strong> A stainless Audemars Piguet Royal Oak with blue dial, manual winding, 37 mm. Super chic and classic, meets my everyday-wear need.</p>
<p><strong>Best cameo in a movie:</strong> The Rolex Paul Newman Daytona with a panda dial in &#8220;Crazy Rich Asians.&#8221; It&#8217;s definitely a show stopper.</p>
<p><strong>Celeb watch icon:</strong> Musician Eric Clapton, known for his Rolexes and Patek Philippes. We sold his exceptionally rare and important platinum Patek Philippe Ref. 2499 in 2012 for roughly $3.7 million.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite watch book:</strong> &#8220;My Time&#8221; by Sandro Fratini describes the author&#8217;s collection of the most prestigious watches in the world.</p>

<p>The New Yorker moved to Hong Kong for her job in watch sales, chronicling her longtime faves and new finds for some 7,800 Insta followers.</p>
 
<p><strong>Personal style:</strong> Simple, chic with a little bit of sexy.</p>
<p><strong>First watch:</strong>&#160;A vintage LeCoultre chronograph in stainless steel from the &#8217;50s. I spotted it on Instagram and DMed the seller immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Watch count:</strong> 10-plus. My recent favorite additions are a Patek Philippe Aquanaut, an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, and a fun new Rolex Oyster Perpetual with the turquoise blue &#8220;Stella&#8221;-looking dial.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite complication:</strong> Perpetual calendars are the most beautiful complications visually and conceptually.</p>
<p><strong>Watch icon:</strong> John Mayer. Honestly, I&#8217;d just like to marry him to be able to wear his watches. But also, he has definitely brought the cool factor to watch collecting for younger generations.</p>
<p><strong>Top watch city:</strong>&#160;Hong Kong, no question. Watches are a part of the culture &#8212; you can see some of the most insanely rare and complicated stuff being worn on the street. Plus, you really have access to buy anything you&#8217;re hunting for. It feels like every watch in the world finds its way in and out of HK at some point.</p>

<p>The Bologna-born expert documents his horological habit for 41,000+ Insta fans using the nom-de-watch John Goldberger.</p>
 
<p><strong>Personal style:</strong> I like to wear handmade suits from Italian tailors, Brooks Brothers shirts and vintage denim or military wear.</p>
<p><strong>First watch:</strong>&#160;A Rolex chronograph, manufactured in 1938. I bought it at an antiques shop in Bologna when I was just 19.</p>
<p><strong>Watch count:</strong> A lot! My latest acquisition was a unique rectangular white-gold world-time watch manufactured in 1940 for Golay Fils &amp; Stahl, Geneva, with a Louis Cottier mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Top watch city:</strong>&#160;Tokyo. There is a great culture for watches, and you can find many shops with vintage or secondhand wristwatches.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite travel piece:</strong> A simple Rolex Submariner with gilt dial. The Submariner is the only watch that you can wear with denim or with a tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>Watch icon:</strong>&#160;John Pierpont Morgan [of banking fame], who accumulated &#8212; in a very short time &#8212; the best timepieces from around the world and published a great book on his own collection. Henry Graves Jr. also had the most discerning eye, and a desire for complex timepieces; Patek Philippe&#8217;s Graves watch was the most complicated watch in the world in the &#8217;30s.</p>

<p>More than 13,000 timepiece obsessives follow this Hong Kong-based pro, a former watch specialist with auction company Bonhams.</p>
 
<p><strong>Personal style:</strong> Between elegant and smart casual. I wear suits almost daily but sometimes dress down.<br>
First watch: A kit that helps you learn to assemble the movement and build your own timepiece. It&#8217;s how I started to develop a deep interest in watch collecting.</p>
<p><strong>Watch count:</strong> Around 100.</p>
<p><strong>Next watch:</strong> The latest Cartier Priv&#233; Tank Asym&#233;trique, inspired by the 1936 original. Most people think only complicated watches are collectible, but this is an excellent example of a simple but desirable one.</p>
<p><strong>Watch icon:</strong> James Ward Packard, famous for founding the car company with his name on it, and a watch collector, too. He pursued pieces with the most complicated functions, leading to today&#8217;s race among brands to create the most complicated watches.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite watch book:</strong> &#8220;The Mastery of Time&#8221; by historian Dominique Fl&#233;chon. It&#8217;s a comprehensive record of watchmaking history, completely factual, unbiased and absolutely non-commercial.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Top watch city:</strong> Geneva. Every corner, every billboard is watch themed. This is probably the only city where you&#8217;ll find a luxury watch display inside a 5-star hotel restroom.</p>

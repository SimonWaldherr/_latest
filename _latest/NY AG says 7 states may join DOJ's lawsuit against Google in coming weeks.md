They will then decide whether to file a complaint and would file a motion to consolidate with the case filed by the DOJ on Tuesday. It would be litigated cooperatively, &#8220;much as we did in the Microsoft case.&#8221;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmakers-doj-antitrust-lawsuit-google" target="_blank">LAWMAKERS HAIL DOJ ANTI-TRUST LAWSUIT AGAINST GOOGLE AS &#8216;LONG OVERDUE&#8217; </a></strong></p><p>&#8220;Over the last year, both the U.S. DOJ and state attorneys general have conducted separate but parallel investigations into Google&#8217;s anti-competitive market behavior.

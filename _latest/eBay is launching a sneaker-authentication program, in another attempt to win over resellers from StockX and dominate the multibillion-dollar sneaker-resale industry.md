eBay is launching a new program for authenticating sneakers on its marketplace.

For many sneakerheads, eBay's longstanding inability to control the spread of fake products was a major deterrent in using the platform to sell shoes.

Under the newly expanded "Authenticity Guarantee" program, all new and pre-owned sneakers sold at $100 or more will pass through an eBay authentication center, where industry experts will inspect each pair before shipping them off to buyers.

eBay bills itself as the originator of the sneaker-resale game and actively works to win over more resellers with its platform.

eBay just made another big move to help it dominate the multibillion-dollar sneaker-resale market.

The platform announced on Monday a plan to launch a new program for authenticating sneakers on the marketplace later this month. The service will be an expansion of eBay's "Authenticity Guarantee" program, which launched in September for watches that sell for more than $2,000 in the US.

Under the new program, all new and pre-owned sneakers that sell for more than $100 in the US will pass through an eBay authentication center, where each pair will be inspected before getting shipped off to buyers. Sneakers that pass inspection will receive an eBay-branded seal of verification. eBay has partnered with Sneaker Con, the largest sneaker show, to create both the authentication facility and outline a checklist for verification.

This latest move for eBay represents another push to win over resellers who are galvanizing the booming market. A Cowen & Co. analysis from July said the sneaker resale industry was worth $2 billion in North America and could reach $30 billion globally by 2030.

eBay bills itself as the originator of the sneaker-resale game and sold more than 5.7 million sneakers in North America in 2019. And the platform's strategy to reascend to the top of the sneaker-resale game is more than a few months in the making.

The company made a big move to attract more sneaker sellers in December by eliminating North American seller fees for any sneaker sold at $100 or more. It previously charged fees of up to 10% to sellers, which deterred some sneakerheads from using the platform. StockX and GOAT both charge various fees for sellers on their platforms.

For many sneakerheads, eBay's longstanding inability to control the spread of fake products was another major deterrent in using the platform for selling sneakers.

"Authentication has become an expectation for today's consumers in categories of high passion and high value, and this program makes eBay the most attractive platform for enthusiasts in these categories," Jordan Sweetnam, eBay's senior vice president and general manager of eBay North America, said in a press release.

eBay also provides detailed sales-trend data to platform users via a free foundational tool called Terapeak. Harry Temkin, eBay's vice president of seller experience, said the company offers more value to resellers than StockX, one of the more popular sneaker-resale platforms today, when it comes to data, customization, and transparency.

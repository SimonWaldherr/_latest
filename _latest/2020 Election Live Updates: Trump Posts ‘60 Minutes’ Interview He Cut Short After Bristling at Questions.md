He accused her of being &#8220;negative&#8221; with her questions. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You brought up a lot of questions that were inappropriately brought up, right from the beginning,&#8221; Mr. Trump says toward the end of the clip.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you should be accountable to the American people?&#8221; Ms. Stahl replies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The footage released by Mr. Trump &#8212; which shows only the president, and not his interlocutor &#8212; was filmed by White House staff members; CBS said that the president&#8217;s aides had pledged to use the footage &#8220;for archival purposes only.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The White House&#8217;s unprecedented decision to disregard their agreement with CBS News and release their footage will not deter &#8217;60 Minutes&#8217; from providing its full, fair and contextual reporting which presidents have participated in for decades,&#8221; CBS News said in a statement.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The interview with Ms. Stahl is set to air on Sunday&#8217;s episode of &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; which also features interviews with the Democratic candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump was clearly upset at the way the interview, filmed at the White House on Tuesday, had gone. Soon after leaving the interview &#8212; and declining to tape a planned segment with Vice President Mike Pence &#8212; Mr. Trump began taunting Ms. Stahl on Twitter, posting a short video of her at the taping and noting that she had not been wearing a mask.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Thursday, Mr. Trump referred to the interview as a &#8220;vicious attempted &#8216;takeout&#8217;&#8221; and told his Twitter followers: &#8220;Watch her constant interruptions &amp; anger. Compare my full, flowing and &#8216;magnificently brilliant&#8217; answers to their &#8216;Q&#8217;s&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Toward the end of the clip, Mr. Trump complains that &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; had been tougher on him than on Mr. Biden. (In fact, &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interviewed Mr. Biden for the same program, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/CBSThisMorning/status/1319241809873293312?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressed him on the sensitive issue </a>of whether he would expand the Supreme Court.)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I see Joe Biden getting softball after softball; I&#8217;ve seen all of his interviews, he&#8217;s never been asked a question that&#8217;s hard,&#8221; the president complains. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Well, forget him for a minute &#8212; you&#8217;re president!&#8221; Ms. Stahl replies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Excuse me, Lesley, you started with me, your first statement was &#8216;Are you ready for tough questions?&#8217;&#8221; the president interjects. &#8220;That&#8217;s no way to talk. No way to talk.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">From off-camera, a man can be heard saying that Mr. Pence was set to join them in five minutes. Mr. Trump objects, &#8220;Well, I think we have enough. I think we have enough of an interview here. OK? That&#8217;s enough. Let&#8217;s go. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump then tells his aides he wants to meet for &#8220;two seconds.&#8221; As he begins to stand up from his chair and remove his microphone, he turns to Ms. Stahl and says: &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you later.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-m-grynbaum" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Michael M.

Biden Jr., who for weeks has declined to clarify his position on expanding the Supreme Court, said in an interview that if elected, he would establish a bipartisan commission of scholars to study a possible court overhaul more broadly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I will ask them to, over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it&#8217;s getting out of whack,&#8221; the Democratic presidential nominee told CBS News&#8217;s Norah O&#8217;Donnell, according to an interview excerpt that is expected to be broadcast in full Sunday on &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The way in which it&#8217;s being handled, and it&#8217;s not about court packing, there&#8217;s a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I&#8217;ve looked to see what recommendations that commission might make.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden, the former vice president who served for decades as a U.S. senator from Delaware, has previously opposed expanding the Supreme Court. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But amid the current battle over Judge Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s nomination by President Trump just before the election &#8212; and calls from some Democrats to expand the court to counteract the last-minute addition of a conservative justice &#8212; Mr. Biden has declined to take a clear position, though <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/12/us/trump-vs-biden/biden-asked-about-expanding-the-supreme-court-says-he-is-not-a-fan-of-the-idea" title="">he acknowledged</a> earlier this month that he was &#8220;not a fan&#8221; of court packing. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">However, he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/presidential-town-halls.html" title="">said</a> last week that he would make his position known to voters before Election Day. The topic is likely to surface at tonight&#8217;s presidential debate.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden&#8217;s latest remarks amounted to a recognition that he could not continue to dodge the subject entirely. But they left questions about his personal position unanswered and irked some advocates of court expansion who believe the issue must be addressed with much greater urgency should he win. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This proposed commission runs the risk of stalling momentum for serious reform,&#8221; said Brian Fallon, executive director of the progressive courts-focused group Demand Justice. &#8220;A commission that would allow opponents of structural reform to run out the clock is not a solution; it&#8217;s a punt.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the past, Mr. Biden has said that taking a firm position would only offer fuel to his opponent. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want,&#8221; Mr. Biden said. &#8220;Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He called the issue a &#8220;live ball&#8221; and said there were &#8220;a number of alternatives&#8221; that &#8220;go well beyond packing.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-glueck" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="republicans-advance-barretts-nomination-as-democrats-boycott"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#republicans-advance-barretts-nomination-as-democrats-boycott">Republicans advance Barrett&#8217;s nomination as Democrats boycott.</a></h2><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</p><p class="css-1ceswkc e1drnplw1"></p><p class="css-mln36k" id="modal-title">transcript</p><p class="css-1701swk">bars</p><p class="css-1t7yl1y">0:00 / 2:10</p><p class="css-og85jy">- 0:00</p><p class="css-1qi8px4">transcript</p><h2 class="css-9wqu2x">Republicans Move Barrett&#8217;s Nomination to Senate Floor</h2><h4 class="css-qsd3hm">The Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to advance Judge Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s Supreme Court nomination despite Democrats boycotting the session in protest.</h4><dl class="css-p98d0w"><dt class="css-xx7kwh"></dt><dd class="css-12tddc8"><p class="css-8hvvyd">&#8220;As you know, our Democratic colleagues informed the committee last night that they will not participate in the hearing &#8212; that was their choice. It will be my choice to vote the nominee out of committee. We&#8217;re not going to allow them to take over the committee. They made a choice not to participate. Each of you, when this is over, I hope you feel like a sense of accomplishment. This is why we all run. It&#8217;s moments like this that make everything you go through matter. It&#8217;s moments like this where you can tell young conservative women there&#8217;s a place at the table for you.&#8221; &#8220;So I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for your patience, to lay out my thoughts and observations with regard to this &#8212; these theatricals with which our Democratic colleagues are presenting us today. This is all for show. This is to try to capture a narrative, which is simply false, and to cover up what they are really about.&#8221; &#8220;As I&#8217;ve since &#8212; as I&#8217;ve said, ever since she was nominated to this position, Judge Amy Coney Barrett is one of the most impressive legal minds in the United States. She&#8217;s a thoughtful and fair-minded lawyer, a loving daughter, wife and mother, and a devout believer in her faith and in the Constitution. She was arguably the most impressive judicial nominee that I&#8217;ve ever seen in any of these hearings, and I&#8217;ve been watching them intently since I was a kid. Judge Barrett is going to make an absolutely outstanding Supreme Court justice, and the American people will be really lucky to have her on the bench. It is a shame that our colleagues on the other side, having failed to lay a glove on Judge Barrett during the hearings, have chosen to walk out on this process. And in so doing, walk out on the American people.&#8221;</p></dd></dl><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/us/politics/22dc-barrett-newsub/22dc-barrett-newsub-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"><p></p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to advance Judge Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s Supreme Court nomination despite Democrats boycotting the session in protest.</p><p class="css-cch8ym"><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Pool photo by Caroline Brehman</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">WASHINGTON &#8212; The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/politics/barrett-nomination-republicans.html" title="">voted to advance President Trump&#8217;s nomination</a> of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, with majority Republicans skirting the panel&#8217;s rules to recommend her confirmation as Democrats boycotted the session in protest.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The lopsided 12-to-0 outcome set up a vote by the full Senate to confirm Judge Barrett on Monday, a month after President Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court.html" title="">nominated her</a> to fill the seat vacated by the  death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If all goes according to plan, Mr. Trump and his party would win a coveted achievement just eight days before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This is why we all run,&#8221; Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the committee, said. &#8220;It&#8217;s moments like this that make everything you go through matter.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The 10 Democrats on the 22-member committee, livid over the extraordinarily speedy process, spurned the vote altogether and forced Republicans to break their own rules to muscle through the nomination. Without the votes to block the judge in either the committee or the full Senate, though, their action was purely symbolic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats have sharply opposed Judge Barrett, a conservative <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/amy-coney-barrett-conservatives.html" title="">in the mold of former Justice Antonin Scalia</a>, on policy grounds. But their goal on Thursday was to tarnish the legitimacy of her confirmation, arguing that Republicans had no right to fill the seat vacated just over a month ago by the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html" title="">death of Justice Ginsburg</a>, when millions of Americans were already voting.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats were particularly angry that Republicans had reversed themselves since 2016, when they refused to consider President Barack Obama&#8217;s Supreme Court nominee, citing the election nine months later.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Republicans have moved at breakneck speed to jam through this nominee, ignoring her troubling record and unprecedented evasions, and breaking longstanding committee rules to set tomorrow&#8217;s vote,&#8221; Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement on Wednesday. &#8220;We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just 12 days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats planned to hold a news conference on the steps of the Capitol galvanizing opposition to the process. Left in their places in the hearing room will be large posters of Americans whose health care coverage they argue could evaporate if Judge Barrett were to side with a conservative majority on the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act when it hears a Republican <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/supreme-court-obamacare-appeal.html" title="">challenge to the law</a> next month.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-campaign-reshaped-by-the-pandemic-enters-its-final-stages-with-tonights-debate-in-nashville"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-campaign-reshaped-by-the-pandemic-enters-its-final-stages-with-tonights-debate-in-nashville">A campaign reshaped by the pandemic enters its final stages with tonight&#8217;s debate in Nashville.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="President Trump during a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/21elections-briefing-lede/21elections-briefing-lede-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">President Trump during a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Doug Mills/The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/trump-biden-presidential-debate.html" title="">last presidential debate</a> happening tonight in Nashville, the contest between President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is entering its final chapter. And once again voters are being reminded just how completely the pandemic has upended this race for the White House.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a normal election year, both candidates would leave Nashville for a nonstop swing through battleground states, packing their days with big rallies, appeals to both supporters and thecurious who are trying to decide who to support. Mr. Trump has pledged to keep on making live appearances in front of big crowds, in defiance of the counsel of medical experts. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Mr. Biden will defer to the advice of health professionals, largely limiting his campaigning to smaller and more controlled events that respect the rules of social distancing and that have been his staple during this odd campaign.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Will that matter?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">This is the time of election season when candidates make their closing arguments and implore supporters to turn out. Mr. Trump, in pushing ahead with his rallies, is well aware of how effective they can be at generating excitement among supporters, as he saw at his huge rallies in 2016. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">George W. Bush demonstrated the power of showing up in 2004 when he arrived on Election Day for a rally in Ohio having made the correct calculation that the excitement and attention generated by a last-minute visit might pull him over the finish line. He defeated his Democratic rival, John F. Kerry, with just under 51 percent of the vote in Ohio.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But that does not necessarily mean that Mr. Biden is at a disadvantage in these final days. From the beginning of the coronavirus, he ran a constrained campaign in deference to the virus, with significantly less travel, fewer public events and even fewer news conferences.

Biden Jr. at the race&#8217;s most crucial juncture.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">To close the budget gap, Mr. Trump has slashed millions of dollars in previously reserved television ads and detoured from the battleground states that will decide the election for a stop in California last weekend to refill his campaign coffers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He has also tried to jump-start his online fund-raising with increasingly aggressive tactics, sending out as many as 14 email solicitations in a day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Mr. Biden still entered October with nearly triple the campaign money Mr. Trump has &#8212; $177 million to $63.1 million &#8212; and is leveraging that edge to expand the battleground map just as Mr. Trump is forced to retrench.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Despite raising more than $1.5 billion in tandem with the Republican Party since 2019, Mr. Trump is now in the same financial straits as he was four years ago, when Hillary Clinton had roughly double the money he did.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump has been quick to point out that Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s financial advantage did not win her the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the financial pinch has engulfed his advisers and party officials in an internal blame game after years of bragging about their fund-raising prowess, according to current and former campaign and administration officials.

Wray, the F.B.I. director, in an evening announcement from the bureau&#8217;s headquarters. Intelligence agencies had collected information that Iran planned to take more steps to influence the vote in coming days, prompting the unusual timing of the briefing as an effort to deter further action.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There was no indication that any election result tallies were changed or that information about who is registered to vote was altered, either of which could affect the outcome of voting that has already begun across the country. Nor do the officials claim that either nation had hacked into voter registration systems, leaving open the possibility that it was available to anyone who knew where to look.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The voter data obtained by Iran and Russia was mostly public, according to one intelligence official, and Iran was exploiting it as a political campaign might. Voters&#8217; names and party registrations are publicly available. That information may have been merged with other identifying material, like email addresses, obtained from other databases, according to intelligence officials, including some sold by criminal hacking networks on the &#8220;dark web.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,&#8221; Mr. Ratcliffe said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The administration&#8217;s announcement that a foreign adversary, Iran, had tried to influence the election by sending intimidating emails was both a stark warning and a reminder of how other powers can exploit the vulnerabilities exposed by the Russian interference in 2016. But it may also play into Mr. Trump&#8217;s hands. For weeks he has argued, without evidence, that the Nov. 3 vote will be &#8220;rigged,&#8221; that mail-in ballots will lead to widespread fraud and that the only way he can be defeated is if his opponents cheat.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Now, on the eve of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/trump-biden-presidential-debate.html" title="">the second debate</a>, he has evidence of foreign influence campaigns designed to hurt his re-election chances, even if they do not affect the voting infrastructure.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Some of the fake emails, sent to Democratic voters, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/florida-alaska-trump-emails.html" title="">purported to be</a> from pro-Trump far-right groups, including the Proud Boys. Iranian hackers tried to cover their tracks, intelligence and security officials said, first routing the emails first through a compromised Saudi insurance company network. Later they sent more than 1,500 emails using the website of an Estonian textbook company, according to an analysis by researchers at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity firm.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Until now, some officials had insisted that Russia remains the primary threat to the election. But the new information, both Republican and Democratic officials said, demonstrates that Iran is building upon Russian techniques and trying to make clear that it, too, is capable of being a force in the election.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julian-barnes" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Julian Barnes</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-e-sanger" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="six-former-commerce-secretaries-endorse-biden"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#six-former-commerce-secretaries-endorse-biden">Six former commerce secretaries endorse Biden.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Six former commerce secretaries endorsed Joseph R.

Giuliani, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-borat.html" title="">has become caught up in Sacha Baron Cohen&#8217;s new &#8220;Borat&#8221; satire</a>, shown in an edited scene following an actress impersonating a reporter into a bedroom and at one point reclining on the bed and putting his hands in his pants in what he later said was an attempt to adjust his clothing.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The excerpt from Mr. Cohen&#8217;s new &#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,&#8221; which will be released on Friday, was described on social media early Wednesday after The Guardian reported that the movie contained <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/21/rudy-giuliani-faces-questions-after-compromising-scene-in-new-borat-film" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;a compromising scene&#8221;</a> featuring Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Late Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani called into WABC radio in New York to say that he was tucking in his shirt after removing microphone wires, and chalked the scene&#8217;s early release up to a scheme to discredit his recent attempts to push corruption accusations against Joseph R. Biden Jr.&#8217;s son, Hunter Biden.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The Borat video is a complete fabrication,&#8221; Mr. Giuliani, 76, tweeted after he got off the air. &#8220;At no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate. If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I called the police,&#8221; he said in a brief text exchange on Wednesday. &#8220;He and all his crew ran away leaving their equipment behind.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still photos and descriptions of the scene from those who have screened the movie say the heavily edited clip, in line with the actor&#8217;s signature mockumentary format, begins with Mr. Giuliani, seated on a couch answering questions. Soon after, the actress, who speaks with a heavy Eastern European accent, asks the former mayor if they can continue their discussion in the bedroom. Mr. Giuliani agrees, and is then shown sitting on a bed, as she appears to take his microphone off and he appears to pat her.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The segment then cuts to the image of Mr. Giuliani, reclining on the bed, placing his hands down the front of his pants.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I had to take off the electronic equipment,&#8221; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMGqi76ihb4&amp;feature=emb_logo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Giuliani told the hosts of the &#8220;Curtis &amp; Juliet Show.</a>&#8221; &#8220;And when the electronic equipment came off, some of it was in the back and my shirt came a little out, although my clothes were entirely on. I leaned back, and I tucked my shirt in, and at that point, at that point, they have this picture they take which looks doctored, but in any event, I&#8217;m tucking my shirt in. I assure you that&#8217;s all I was doing.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The scene ends with Mr. Cohen, dressed in an outlandish pink costume, bursting in to the room and shouting that the woman, played by the actor <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7210025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Bakalova</a>, was 15 years old (the actor is 24, according to the IMDb).</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Cohen was frightened by his call to the police, bolted and left him talking with the filmmaker&#8217;s lawyer.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The former mayor is not the first Republican politician to be ensnared in one of Mr. Cohen&#8217;s cringe-inducing pranks. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Others include the former Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama, a Georgia lawmaker who <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/arts/television/jason-spencer-sacha-baron-cohen.html" title="">resigned after Mr. Cohen fooled him into repeatedly yelling a racial epithet </a>and the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&#8221; is being released Friday on Amazon Prime.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Glenn Thrush</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="pence-campaigns-in-michigan-and-indiana-today-as-harris-speaks-at-a-virtual-rally"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#pence-campaigns-in-michigan-and-indiana-today-as-harris-speaks-at-a-virtual-rally">Pence campaigns in Michigan and Indiana today, as Harris speaks at a virtual rally.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="President Trump and Joseph R.

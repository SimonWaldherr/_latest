<p class="mol-para-with-font">Fauci has been advocating for public health measures, including social distancing and mask wearing, for several months.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his 60 Minutes interview, Fauci addressed his advice from early in the pandemic when he urged Americans not to wear masks because he was concerned there would be a shortage before changing tune about a month later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That conflicting advice was seized on by Trump during the presidential debate.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It became clear that cloth coverings... and not necessarily a surgical mask or an N95, cloth coverings, work. So now there's no longer a shortage of masks. Meta-analysis studies show that, contrary to what we thought, masks really do work in preventing infection,' Fauci said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When you find out you're wrong, it's a manifestation of your honesty to say, 'Hey, I was wrong. I did subsequent experiments and now it's this way.'&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fauci has also blasted other experts who say measures like mask wearing should be put to the side so that the disease can spread in order to achieve herd immunity.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump's more laissez faire approach to eradicating the pandemic clashed with Fauci, who repeatedly called for Americans to adhere to social distancing and emphasized the importance of face masks.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair's most recent disagreement came over herd immunity, which was reportedly proposed to Trump by medical adviser Scott Atlas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Several health experts have dismissed herd immunity as a viable solution, including Fauci, who called it 'total nonsense,' as well as 'scientifically and ethically problematic.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fauci said in a GMA interview last week: 'If you just let things rip and let the infection go - no masks, crowds - that quite frankly is ridiculous.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What that will do is there will be so many people in the community that you can't shelter, that you can't protect, who are going to get sick and get serious consequences.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you talk to anybody who has any experience in epidemiology and infectious diseases they'll tell you it's risky and you'll wind up with many more infections of vulnerable people, which will lead to hospitalizations and deaths.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think we've got to look that square in the eye and say it's nonsense.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Nevada Sunday, Trump kept the focus on Biden's 'corruption' and the latest in the Hunter Biden saga, referring to the 'laptop from hell.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is the most boring human being I've ever seen,' Trump said of Biden, while also claiming he was running a 'criminal enterprise' alongside his son.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Bidens make 'crooked' Hillary Clinton look like an absolute amateur,' Trump said, using a throwback insult from his successful 2016 campaign.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pointing a finger at Hunter, Trump said, 'This guy's a vacuum cleaner,' alleging he was sucking up tons of foreign money.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I call him the human vacuum cleaner,' the president said to cheers and applause from the crowd of several thousand watching the president in the hot Nevada sun.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The crowd started chanting 'lock him up!' referring to Biden and his son.&#160;&#160;</p><img id="i-55e162f4c598d1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="634" alt="President Donald Trump appeared at a campaign rally Sunday afternoon in Carson City, Nevada 16 days before the presidential election where he slammed the Biden's as 'crooked', his opponent Joe Biden as 'boring' and boasted 'the best is yet to come'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-55e162f4c598d1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/17/34550186-8856151-President_Donald_Trump_appeared_at_a_campaign_rally_Sunday_after-a-60_1603126533256.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="President Donald Trump appeared at a campaign rally Sunday afternoon in Carson City, Nevada 16 days before the presidential election where he slammed the Biden's as 'crooked', his opponent Joe Biden as 'boring' and boasted 'the best is yet to come'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p></p> <p></p><p class="imageCaption">President Donald Trump appeared at a campaign rally Sunday afternoon in Carson City, Nevada 16 days before the presidential election where he slammed the Biden's as 'crooked', his opponent Joe Biden as 'boring' and boasted 'the best is yet to come'</p><img id="i-74e85467c0940d98" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="A woman dressed up in Native American costume awaits the arrival of President Donald Trump in Carson City, Nevada Sunday" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-74e85467c0940d98" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/17/34548792-8856151-A_woman_dressed_up_in_Native_American_costume_awaits_the_arrival-a-61_1603126533309.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A woman dressed up in Native American costume awaits the arrival of President Donald Trump in Carson City, Nevada Sunday" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p></p> <p></p><p class="imageCaption">A woman dressed up in Native American costume awaits the arrival of President Donald Trump in Carson City, Nevada Sunday&#160;</p><img id="i-1666da19e07312f0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="President Donald Trump's supporters get ready for the president's arrival in Carson City, Nevada Sunday" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-1666da19e07312f0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/17/34548796-8856151-President_Donald_Trump_s_supporters_get_ready_for_the_president_-a-66_1603126533324.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="President Donald Trump's supporters get ready for the president's arrival in Carson City, Nevada Sunday" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p></p> <p></p><p class="imageCaption">President Donald Trump's supporters get ready for the president's arrival in Carson City, Nevada Sunday&#160;</p><img id="i-fdc80a74d9dc558f" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="634" alt="'So a giant trove of emails show Hunter Biden making deals, setting up deals with his father Joe,' Trump said at one point.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">On this three-day swing, Nevada was the only swing state that tilted toward the Democrats in 2016, with 47.9 per cent of voters in the state picking Clinton and&#160;45.5 for Trump.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Saturday he did back-to-back rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin.&#160;And on Monday, Trump will do another&#160;two rallies in Arizona, a state that he won in 2016, but looks ripe for the Democrats' picking.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president woke up Sunday at his Las Vegas hotel and attended church services at the International Church of Las Vegas before jetting off to Orange County, California for several hours to raise money for his campaign 16 days before the presidential election.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Democrats and Biden have far outraised the Republican National Committee and Trump in August and September.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Carson City, the president suggested the Democrats were cheating - and their fundraising was like a 'quid pro quo,' aiming the comment at Biden.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump's impeachment revolved around whether there was a 'quid pro quo' when the president held up military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country's president to announce investigations into Hunter and Joe Biden.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Upon landing in Reno, Nevada, Trump gave reporters a quick update on the on-again, off-again stimulus talks taking place back in Washington, D.C.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think Nancy Pelosi maybe is coming along we'll find out,' Trump said. 'Want to do it at a bigger number than she wants. That doesn't mean all the Republicans agree with me but I think they will in the end if she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So we'll see what happens,' Trump added.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That didn't stop Trump from attacking the House speaker at the Carson City event, making fun of her for not wanting his 'wall' but living in a gating community and eating fancy ice cream.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also suggested Pelosi's recent talk about the 25th Amendment, which came after the president was hospitalized with the coronavirus, was actually so Democrats can dispose of Biden for his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, should they win.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Biden is gone-zo,' Trump said, a reference to the 77-year-old's age. ''Can you imagine having Kamala?' he added, calling her the most liberal member of Congress.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president also hit out at some Congressional Republicans, like GOP Sen. Ben Sasse, who was extremely critical of the president on a call with constituents.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have some stupid people, you know,' Trump said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Now we have this guy Sasse. He wants to make a statement. Little Ben Sasse,' Trump jabbed. 'Republicans needs to stick together better.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump ended his rally boasting, 'The best is yet to come'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we're taking back this country. So with your help, your devotion and your drive we're going to keep on winning, winning, winning!' he said as attendees joined in his chant.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Masks were not widespread at Trump's Nevada rally to prevent the spread of COVID-19.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Trump warned that Biden would be more heavy-handed in dealing with the virus, which continues to see new spikes.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If he comes in, Carson City will become a ghosttown,' Trump warned. 'The Christmas season will be cancelled.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#160;</p><p>By <a href="/home/search.html?s=&amp;authornamef=Ross+Ibbetson+For+Mailonline" class="author" rel="nofollow">Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline</a> </p></div>

  Covid-19: Short national lockdown decision due in Wales 
description: > 
  PA Media Copyright: PA MediaSpeaking to the BBC earlier, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said any more delay to a decision on Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions would "put people's lives at risk".But Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has said reaching a deal is "not about the size of the cheque".He told Sky News: "It's about protecting low-paid workers, people who are self-employed, supporting businesses and preventing them from collapsing."We've always said we would put people's health first, and we will do that.But health is about more than controlling the virus - people's mental health, I think, is now pretty low given that we've been under restrictions here for three months already."

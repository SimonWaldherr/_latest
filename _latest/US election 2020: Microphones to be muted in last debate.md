<div><p>Getting the trade deficit down was
a high priority for President Trump. It has not happened. In the year before his
inauguration the deficit was $481bn (&#163;372bn in current figures). In 2019 - the most recent full year
and one in which economic activity was not yet distorted by the pandemic - it
was $577 bn. That was slightly lower than the year before but it was still
well above the level he inherited.</p><p>A growing economy does tend to do more

in some financial flows including money sent home by foreign nationals) last

with China did lead to a decline in the bilateral deficit last year as imports
fell more than exports. But that was partly offset increases in goods coming
from many other countries. It is another question whether a trade deficit of
that scale matters as much President Trump thinks it does or whether trade
policy can reduce it much.</p><p>Many - though not all - economists think it is not such
a problem, and many say that a deficit is not the result of other countries
trading unfairly - it is what you get when a country saves less than it invests. </p></div>

  The man who scored the last goal of last season's Champions League got the first of holders Bayern Munich's new campaign as they brushed aside Atletico Madrid with ominous efficiency.Kingsley Coman scored and assisted as Hans-Dieter Flick's team took a 2-0 first half lead and, in unplayable form, he got the fourth as they ran out 4-0 winners.Atletico will play a lot worse this season and come away with a win.Booked: Alaba, Muller Atletico: Oblak, Trippier, Savic, Felipe, Lodi, Llorente (Lemar 79), Herrera, Koke (Torreira 79), Carrasco (Vitolo 76), Felix, Suarez (Correa 76).As they traipsed off at the end the consolation was that having forced 16 chances Bayern might have scored more.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The warning signs were there early on as Jan Oblak saved from the Coman but the Atletico keeper could do nothing on 28 minutes when Joao Felix was caught napping in midfield and Joshua Kimmich clipped a pass over the top of Atletico's defence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coman ghosted in behind Kieran Trippier and he beat the keeper with a precise finish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diego Simeone was furious with Felix for his sloppy midfield play but the Atletico coach was almost celebrating as Luis Suarez had the chance to level only to send a cross from the impressive Yannick Carasco wide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coman made the second, when gifted possession by Hector Herrera he crossed and Leon Goretzka lashed the ball into the far corner past Oblak.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first half had passed Joao Felix by but at the start of the second it looked as if he had pulled a goal back. His shot from the edge of the area beat Manuel Neuer but Suarez and Herrera were offside and judged to have been blocking the keeper's view.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was more hope when Felix found Carrasco but the Belgian winger sliced his shot into the side netting. Atletico did not fold but at the start of the second period many of their forward forays were under-manned &#8211; the fear maybe that leaving space behind they would suffer Barcelona's 8-2 Champions League fate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A drubbing was coming all the same. Corentin Tolisso's shot from 30 yards out whistled past Oblak and into the top corner to make it 3-0 and Coman still had another rabbit in his hat to make it four.</p><img id="i-d8ff3bea8cd8259a" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="634" alt="Corentin Tolisso&#8217;s shot whistled past Jan Oblak and into the top corner to make it 3-0" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-d8ff3bea8cd8259a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34682714-8865799-image-a-34_1603317872704.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Corentin Tolisso&#8217;s shot whistled past Jan Oblak and into the top corner to make it 3-0" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Corentin Tolisso's shot whistled past Jan Oblak and into the top corner to make it 3-0</p><img id="i-33333a31ffbfebfe" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="458" width="634" alt="Diego Simeone was powerless on the touchline as Bayern proved too good for his Atletico side" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-33333a31ffbfebfe" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34682728-8865799-image-a-35_1603317886996.jpg" height="458" width="634" alt="Diego Simeone was powerless on the touchline as Bayern proved too good for his Atletico side" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Diego Simeone was powerless on the touchline as Bayern proved too good for his Atletico side</p><img id="i-400f7d5c6e0b763c" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="454" width="634" alt="Luis Suarez suffered a second humiliating loss to Bayern this year after Barcelona's 8-2 defeat" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-400f7d5c6e0b763c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34682736-8865799-image-a-36_1603317904307.jpg" height="454" width="634" alt="Luis Suarez suffered a second humiliating loss to Bayern this year after Barcelona's 8-2 defeat" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Luis Suarez suffered a second humiliating loss to Bayern this year after Barcelona's 8-2 defeat</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Atletico's defence for once parked on the halfway line a ball over the top sent him clear and having turned Felipe one way and then the other he scored past Oblak.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bayern flexed their squad-depth muscle bringing on Alphonso Davies - the last thing Trippier wanted to see having been tormented by Coman in the first period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joao Felix sent a late free-kick sailing over Neuer's bar as Atletico looked for a goal.

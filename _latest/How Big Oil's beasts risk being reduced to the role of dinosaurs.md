<div><p>They used to dominate the stock market. Today, the big beasts of Big Oil are at risk of becoming dinosaurs:&#160;shrivelled remnants of their former selves.</p>
<p>In terms of market value, ExxonMobil, BP and Shell combined are now worth less than Tesla alone.</p>
<p>Once the world&#8217;s biggest company, at $146bn (&#163;113bn) Exxon is worth only a fraction of the&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/elon-musk/">$432bn value of Elon Musk&#8217;s electric carmaker.</a></p>
<p>The titans of Big Tech have taken over the corporate jungle as a toxic cocktail of swooning oil prices and jitters over long-term demand for crude oil have sapped their valuations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, investors fret about stranded assets and the financial risk that much of the oil and gas in their reserves may never be produced because of growing concerns about climate change.</p>
<p>Belatedly and in different ways, the oil giants are retrying to reinvent themselves. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/04/25/uk-must-kick-start-carbon-capture-risk-spiralling-climate-change/">Have they left it too late?</a> Is the industry doomed or can it embrace the colossal opportunity presented by the climate transition?</p>
<p>In a new four part series, The Daily Telegraph explores the future of Big Oil.</p>
<p>In the first instalment, published online later today, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard explores the role of Carbon Capture and Storage.</p>
<p>Once derided as an impossible dream, investment in CCS technology,&#160;where carbon dioxide is stripped from the emissions produced by power plants and factories for secure long-term storage,&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/15/carbon-capture-systems-must-developed-uk-have-hope-reaching/">has surged in recent years</a>.</p>

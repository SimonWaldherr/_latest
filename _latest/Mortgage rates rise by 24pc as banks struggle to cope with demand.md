One of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders has increased interest rates by as much as a quarter, as banks try to dampen demand from home buyers.

Experts said banks and building societies had been overwhelmed with mortgage applications thanks to the booming property market. In turn, lenders have increased their rates to quell the demand.

Halifax announced on Friday that several of its rates would rise by 0.61 percentage points. Customers with a 20pc deposit are among those hardest hit by the move. One of the bank’s two-year fixed-rate deals increased from 2.5pc to 3.11pc, a rise of 24pc.

A buyer taking out this mortgage on a home worth £237,963, the average house price, will now pay £914 a month for repayments versus £854 previously, based on a 25-year term.

Other major lenders have also increased rates. For customers with a 15pc deposit, Nationwide’s five-year fixed-rate loan increased from 2.94pc to 3.24pc, a rise of 10pc. The same borrower taking out a two-year fix with NatWest saw rates rise from 2.79pc to 2.94pc, a 5pc increase.

Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial, a mortgage broker, said the majority of rate rises had targeted small-deposit borrowers, as they carried a higher risk for lenders.

However, banks were concerned about being flooded with applications from all customers and were spreading higher rates to loans for medium and larger deposits.

“The lenders have been raising their rates because they are worried about processing delays, but they are also leapfrogging each other, so they don’t top the mortgage best buy tables,” he said.

Few banks currently offer loans to customers with a 10pc deposit and Mr Strutt added that it was unlikely that these loans would return in the near future.

A Halifax spokesman said it was committed to offering borrowers a wide choice of mortgages.

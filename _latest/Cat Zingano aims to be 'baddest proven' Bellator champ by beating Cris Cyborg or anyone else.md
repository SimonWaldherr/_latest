Cat Zingano is just one fight into her Bellator tenure, but she’s not looking to waste any time.

Zingano (11-4 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) made a successful promotional debut last month at Bellator 245 by winning a unanimous decision against Gabby Holloway.

Having already notched finishes over the likes of current UFC dual champion Amanda Nunes and former UFC bantamweight champ Miesha Tate, Zingano has some notable names on her resume and came close to her ultimate goal in 2015, but fell short to then UFC bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey.

She’s currently embarking on a new chapter in her career as a featherweight and wants a title shot against the winner of Bellator champ Cris Cyborg and Arlene Blencowe, who are scheduled to fight Oct. 15 in the main event of Bellator 249. But since Zingano is looking to get back in there before the end of the year, she understands that she’ll likely have to fight someone else considering the timeline, and she’s more than willing to do so.

“I’m in this sport for gold,” Zingano told MMA Junkie Radio. “I’m not in the business of bronze or silver, and so I want to go for who’s the champion. On the same token, I’ve been looking at Cris Cyborg my whole career. Since I was just in jiu-jitsu I remember looking at her and thinking she’s a beast and wondering what the math is of me plus her and how that goes. We’ve kind of been revolving around each other this whole time, and I still want to lock horns with her, so whether or not she’s the champion, I think Arlene is excellent and is a big threat to (Cyborg) coming up here, so whatever that looks like, I still would like to lock horns with each of them individually.

“Whether that’s the next fight, I don’t know, or if I’m supposed to get another one especially because I’m hoping to fight again before the end of the year or at least the beginning of the year. I don’t know if they’re going to want their turnover to be that fast, so if that means in the meanwhile I get another fight, and I get more time and experience back in there, I’d definitely take that. I wouldn’t say no, but at the end of the day, I’m looking to be the baddest proven world champion at 145, and that means beating whoever has the belt at that time.”

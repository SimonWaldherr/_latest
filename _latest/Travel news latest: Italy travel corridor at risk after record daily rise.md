The Government is due to update its travel corridors list this afternoon, and Italy is among the countries at risk of having a travel quarantine imposed.

Yesterday, Italy recorded 7,332 new cases of Covid-19, its highest ever tally, meaning cases in the Mediterranean country are now at 58.3 per 100,000 over seven days. The threshold, after which a travel quarantine is assessed, is 20 cases per 100,000.

Despite the significant rise in cases, ministers may spare Italy for its handling of the virus. Arrivals from high risk countries, including the UK, must now take a test on arrival, and strict new face covering rules have been introduced across the country.

Other countries under scrutiny for new travel restrictions are Sweden (43.8 cases per 100,000), Germany (34.3), Greece (23.5) and Cyprus (22.8).

Since the UK reopened its borders in July, a number of popular holiday destinations have lost their travel corridors, including France, Spain, mainland Portugal and Turkey. There are now only four destinations Britons can visit, without any restrictions at all.

An Italy travel ban would be a huge blow for British holidaymakers with trips booked over half term. If it is introduced, it is likely anyone in Italy right now would have until 4am on Saturday to return home, or else face a mandatory 14-day quarantine.

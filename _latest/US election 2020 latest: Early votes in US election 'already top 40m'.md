He is a progressive reluctantly voting for Joe Biden.</strong></p><p><strong>Why does this election matter to you?</strong></p><p>This election is important to me, because it will determine the future livelihood of me and my family. I am the youngest of five, and we are first generation Americans, our parents were born in Mexico. I have seen my parents work relentlessly, but they have made little progress financially. </p><p>Currently, my dad is approaching 60, my mom is diabetic, they have no insurance, and little to no savings. As for myself, I currently have no insurance, I am a full-time student and a full-time essential worker at a grocery store. This election matters to me because if Biden were to lose and Trump successfully appoints Amy Coney [Barrett] my hopes for affordable health care, raise in the minimum wage, legal protection of minorities, the reversal of climate change, the protection of democracy, and so much more, is at stake.</p><p><strong>What inspired you to vote in this election?</strong></p><p>I was inspired to vote in this election, because I am scared for my future, my country's future, and the world. Currently the United State's position as a world leader is faltering, and in its void fascist rhetoric and abuse of human rights are on a rise. I don't want to see my home and the world continue down that path. If Biden is elected, then I shall have some more hope for the future. </p><p>In my area, voters are very disillusioned. For a lot of us Biden is far from our first choice. A lot of us were inspired by the progressive candidates' call for unity, reform and financial wellbeing, but now we must choose one of two candidates, both of which are more alike than different.</p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Closing line" class="qa-lazyload-image lazyload lazyautosizes"><p class="lx-media-asset__copyright gel-minion"><p>BBC</p><p class="gs-u-vh">Copyright: BBC</p></p><p><strong>Williams </strong><strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53444939" alt="is a member of our US election voter panel">is a member of our US election voter panel</a></strong><strong>.

<div><p class="teal-video-wrap"></p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It's a Tuesday morning and a small group of people has gathered near&#160;the Southwest Airlines<strong>&#160;</strong>ticketing counter in Terminal 4 of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. They're socially distanced, wearing masks and listening closely to&#160;David Harvey,&#160;Southwest's vice president of its business-travel focused team, Southwest Business.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Harvey has added "tour guide" to his list of duties in recent months. On this day, he's leading people&#160;responsible for planning corporate&#160;travel for their respective Valley-based<strong>&#160;</strong>companies&#160;through Sky Harbor to show them how the flying process has changed due to the new coronavirus.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Tours are&#160;one tool&#160;Southwest and its competitor Delta have used to&#160;regain the confidence of business partners as well as help build consumer trust ahead of the quickly approaching holiday travel season.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-flights-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>The COVID-19 guide to holiday travel:&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2020/10/16/covid-19-holiday-travel-guide-and-why-you-shouldnt-go/3652609001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">And the case for why you shouldn't go this year</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">How COVID-19 has affected air travel</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The COVID-19 pandemic, along with&#160;its related <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">travel advisories and restrictions</a>, hammered the airline industry. In March, traffic at Sky Harbor dropped nearly overnight, from numbers on pace to break records to the airport <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/airlines/2020/03/27/coronavirus-economic-impact-phoenix-sky-harbor-airport-huge/2925609001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">seeing just 15% of its normal passenger traffic.</a>&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Over the months, that number has ticked up, with Sky Harbor seeing about <a href="https://www.skyharbor.com/docs/default-source/pdfs/statisticsreports/phx-statistics-2020/phx_airportstats_2020_08.pdf?sfvrsn=8fbf6c89_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">39% of the passengers</a>&#160;it normally would see in August.&#160;One of the biggest factors in that drop in passengers is the&#160;reduction of&#160;business travel.</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Though the airlines have seen some improvement in leisure travel, business travel still has not returned.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We know that it is&#160;going to take&#160;a little bit longer for businesses to return to the sky. Their budgets have been hit. They are concerned about all the right things &#8212; liability, what's their health and wellness plan,"&#160;Harvey said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Both Southwest and Delta Air Lines are conducting these private&#160;tours, hoping to answer questions and provide reassurance to their business partners&#160;that they are doing everything they can to keep travelers safe during the pandemic.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-flights-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Airports compete for worried flyers:</strong>&#160; <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/09/28/airports-try-to-sell-worried-fliers-on-their-covid-19-safety-measures/3532227001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">They're offering on-site COVID-19 testing, TSA appointments, cleaning robots</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Is it safe to fly?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"You have anxious fliers not with a pandemic," said Caitlin Blair, a Delta flight attendant who lives in Phoenix. "You can feel that energy sometimes."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She's had to change her approach with passengers in small ways by doing things like "smiling with her eyes" to reassure passengers.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But there are many things that have changed as airlines rework their processes to try and protect both employees and passengers while making them feel comfortable to fly. Even with their best efforts, in&#160;absence of a vaccine, the airlines&#160;are still fighting headwinds in regaining trust as public health officials continue to advise against nonessential travel.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In October,&#160;the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the international trade group that represents the airline industry,&#160;<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-09-08-012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">touted&#160;research</a> that seemed to show a very low chance of contracting COVID-19 on a plane, with&#160;only 44 cases&#160;traced to a flight during a time when more than 1.2 billion passengers traveled.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In August, the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/airlines/2020/08/11/is-flying-safe-frontier-airlines-ceo-barry-biffle-says-yes/3301241001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told The Arizona Republic</a> it was performing many more&#160;air contact investigations&#160;than it did before the pandemic began. The CDC said that in 2018 and 2019 it&#160;performed an average of 150 air contact investigations each year. From January to&#160;July 2020, it&#160;initiated more than 1,500 investigations.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But the agency cautioned reading into the absence of cases&#160;connected to airlines from those investigations.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"CDC is not able to definitively determine that potential cases were associated (or not) with exposure in the air cabin or through air travel given the numerous opportunities for potential exposure associated with the entire travel journey and widespread global distribution of the virus," Jasmine Reed, a spokesperson for the CDC, said via&#160;email in August.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">IATA believes this is proof&#160;that the&#160;the layered approach to passenger safety, which includes everything from electrostatic cleaning of the plane, to wearing masks and socially distancing during the boarding process, is working.&#160;</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Providing certainty during an uncertain time</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Both Southwest and Delta have decided the best way to answer questions and ease fears of flying during the pandemic&#160;is to lift the veil and let their customers&#160;see the layered approach to safety&#160;themselves. Both airlines conducted private tours at Sky Harbor the week of Oct. 12.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I did about six different tours with different travel agencies, travel managers,"&#160;Tom Wettig, the station chief for Delta Air Lines, said about the tours he's conducted in recent months.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-flights-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Delta has also conducted tours for&#160;corporate travel partners in 12 other cities it services.&#160;&#160;Along with several virtual town halls, Southwest has done similar tours in five cities it serves.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It's critical for them to actually come to the airport," Harvey said about bringing corporate clients on the tour to see the changes firsthand.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The tours go through the entire flight process, from checking in to going behind security to see the plane.&#160;&#160;Nearly every part of the process has changed due to the pandemic. Employees receive&#160;temperature checks. Kiosks to check in are spaced farther apart. Airlines&#160;board&#160;fewer passengers at a time.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Airline staff are also quick to point out&#160;the aircraft's&#160;HEPA filtration system, which turns over the air in the aircraft every 2-3 minutes.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>FOR SUBSCRIBERS</strong>: <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/airlines/2020/10/13/phoenix-mesa-gateway-airport-allegiant-traffic/5931163002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport&#160;sees increase in passengers</a>&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The hope is that information will help provide some certainty in an uncertain time.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"So that they&#160;can be the voice&#160;back into their companies and say "look Southwest is doing everything in their&#160;power to make it a clean and safe environment," Harvey said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The airlines also hope that as more people experience safe flights, they will share that experience with others.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We're excited to see them. We hope to see them out over the next few months and when they come out we want to show them what we're doing, what we're invested in, what we're focusing on is the right things to keep them safe," Wettig said.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-flights-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Some of the changes you'll see the next time you fly</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The next time you fly, you'll likely see a lot of changes in response to the pandemic. Among&#160;the things you should expect:</p><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">Most airlines are requiring you to acknowledge you understand their safety rules and will not travel sick.&#160;</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">You'll need to wear a mask your&#160;entire flight, so choose a comfortable one.&#160;</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">You'll board in smaller groups, often 8-10 people to give you space to distance</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">Southwest and Delta have blocked middle seats. Southwest will keep those free until Nov. 30. Delta has promised to keep those open through Jan. 6, 2021.</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">Cabin service may be limited.&#160;</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">Flight attendants may not be allowed to help you put&#160;your luggage in the overhead bin, so pack accordingly.&#160;</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">To allow proper distancing, you'll need to stay in your seat and allow the row in front of you to deplane before you do.&#160;</li></ul><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">You can connect with Arizona Republic Consumer Travel Reporter Melissa Yeager through&#160;email at <a href="mailto:melissa.yeager@azcentral.com" class="gnt_ar_b_a">melissa.yeager@azcentral.com</a>.

Covid marshals have been ordered to target weddings, parties, pubs and restaurants with body-worn videos to film evidence of breaches, under new Government guidelines.

The marshals - who the Government suggests should have security guard training - will be expected to call in police or council inspectors to enforce any breaches at premises they visit.

Dubbed “Covid Wombles,” they will be issued with a checklist of Covid measures to ensure compliance in restaurants, pubs, bars, takeaways, shops and branches, tourist attractions, “close contact services” like hairdressers and nail bars, “wedding receptions and celebrations.”

The Government suggests council marshals could operate a yellow card system, where they issue

up to two warnings before businesses face fines or even closure.

They will also be expected to prevent mixing between groups in pubs, clubs and streets after the 10pm curfew, encourage social distancing in “busy night-life areas” and tell members of the public to wear masks.

The guidelines, issued by the ministry of housing communities and local government, recommend they should be trained in “de-escalation techniques” because of the potential risks of confrontations with members of the public.

The guidance identifies two grades of Covid marshals. “Type 2” marshals will be charged with a “policing” style role.

But “Type 1” will only be responsible for cleaning touch points, directing pedestrians through one-way systems, promoting Covid-19 secure messaging and handing out face coverings and sanitisers.

Councils have been handed £30 million to recruit and train the Covid marshals whom the Government suggests should be paid and be issued with PPE, hi-vis jackets and radio systems.

However, the guidance stressed marshals should not enforce social distancing regulations, issue fines, or engage physically with the public or attempt to restrain anybody. That remains the remit of the police and council enforcement officers.

It cited the example of Charnwood borough council where teams of two marshals patrolled streets with body cameras. “In case of any severe breaches, the stewards informed the police directly or the council’s designated officer on duty to collate the findings,” it said.

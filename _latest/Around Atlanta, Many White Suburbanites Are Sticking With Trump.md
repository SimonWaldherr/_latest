  Natalie Pontius is an interior decorator, married with two children and a University of Georgia alumna.She was born and raised in Atlanta, but moved to the city’s exurbs with her family several years ago, drawn to the region’s quality of public education.“The riots, the push to defund the police — that’s not the direction our country needs to go,” Ms. Pontius, 48, said.Recent polling shows that these voters have helped Trump maintain his razor-thin lead over Mr. Biden for Georgia’s suburban vote.Their continued support is critical to the president’s chances in the state, whose 16 electoral votes are essential for his path to re-election and where polling shows the two candidates neck-and-neck overall.

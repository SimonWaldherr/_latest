  University of Michigan Students Ordered To Stay In Place Amid COVID-19 Rise 
description: > 
  County health authorities issued an emergency stay-in-place order for University of Michigan undergraduate students after they were found to make up more than 60% of local COVID-19 cases.The order announced by the Washtenaw County Health Department on Tuesday will last until Nov. 3.“The situation locally has become critical, and this order is necessary to reverse the current increase in cases,” county Health Officer Jimena Loveluck said.Last month, Michigan State University in East Lansing urged all of its localized students to self-quarantine for two weeks following a surge of COVID-19 cases as students returned for the fall semester.During the first three weeks of September, the city of East Lansing saw a 315% increase in total case count, the Ingham County Health Department said.

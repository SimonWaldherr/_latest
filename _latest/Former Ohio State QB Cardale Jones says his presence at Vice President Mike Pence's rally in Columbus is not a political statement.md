COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Former Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones, and the Buckeyes' national football championship, earned a shout out from Vice President Mike Pence as he spoke at a rally Monday.

But the Cleveland native, who led Ohio State at the end of the 2014 season to the College Football Playoff National Championship, wasn't interested in discussing whom he supports in the presidential election Nov. 3.

"I don't talk politics," Jones said when asked by a Dispatch reporter to comment.

In a later tweet, Jones wrote: "People are going to infer what they want. I came out to support a friends business hosting a presidential event and the #FOP, an Organization of law enforcement that holds each other accountable for misconduct."

After starring in the Buckeyes' 42-20 national championship win over Oregon, Jones played one game in the NFL for the Buffalo Bills. He most recently played for the DC Defenders of the XFL.

During his remarks, Pence recognized Jones and OSU's national title, offering up the obligatory "O-H!" The former Indiana governor said it was hard for a Hoosier to root for the Buckeyes.

Emotions ran high at times outside Pence’s rally, where protesters voiced their dissent toward the administration of Republican President Donald Trump.

Staged at concrete contractor Nickolas Savko & Sons, the “Make America Great Again” event drew supporters and protesters alike, each wielding a different message.

“I have so much emotion around this president and the administration and they way they have torn down our democracy,” said Linda Strapp, 58, of Columbus.

Strapp said she felt an obligation to protest because Trump supporters do not understand the amount of lives the current administration has negatively impacted.

Trump supporters filed into the rally as groups outside held signs and flags calling for change and objecting to a myriad of issues spanning from environmental policy to human rights to racial disparity.

Columbus resident Kathy Burgess, 56, said it is her mission to end white supremacy, and that this propelled her to come to the rally and protest.

“Donald Trump and his campaign, they thrive on hate,” Burgess said. “I wake up Black in this war every morning, so every morning that I wake up Black I’m going to be here to fight against white supremacy. Once you end white supremacy, the police brutality dies along with it.”

Protesters from the Ohio Democratic Party invited Dr. Daniel Skinner, an associate professor in healthy policy at Ohio University, to speak to passersby about false information, among other issues.

Skinner said the stakes are extremely high, especially given the ideology of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, who is on record opposing some aspects of the Affordable Care Act and has objected to the Roe v. Wade ruling making abortion legal.

“We are at a moment of absolute crisis, and as the vice president made clear at the debate, they don’t have a plan to undo the damage that’s been done,” Skinner said.

He said the need to have a voice was only amplified by the vice presidential debate, where Pence did not voice a plan to address any of the pressing needs in Ohio.

“We have to be here to counteract any false information, but also to just make sure we are present, especially as people are voting right now,” Skinner said.

The Pence rally is the most recent in a series of events Trump's campaign has held with surrogates and campaign principals in Ohio. Trump himself recently visited the state, and Pence was in Zanesville in September.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is back in Ohio as well on Monday for events in Toledo and Cincinnati. The dueling events are the latest evidence that the campaigns believe Ohio, a traditional swing state, is in play for the 2020 election.

Trump won in Ohio by more than 8 points in 2016, but recent polling suggests that the state could be a tossup.

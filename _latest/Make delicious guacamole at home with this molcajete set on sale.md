<p>Is it even a party without guacamole? We say no. Not only is it super simple and affordable to make, but the notion that it doesn't travel well is also totally false. Simply squeeze a bit of lime juice over the surface and you're good to go. Plus, if you mention you made it in your new molcajete, it'll seem that much fancier.</p>
<p>A molcajete is a traditional mortar and pestle used by Mexican cooks. This one's surface is made entirely of volcanic stone, ideal for grinding and releasing flavorful oils from vegetables and spices, which means your guacamole will taste like so much more than just avocados and onions.</p>

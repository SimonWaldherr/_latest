description: > 
  New York (CNN Business) JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence Tuesday in America's ability to get through next month's election even as he urged the federal government to do more to prevent a double-dip recession."I have great faith in this country and I'm sure we'll have a proper election," Dimon told reporters during a conference call in response to a question about doubts over election results."A decent stimulus package would be helpful," Dimon said, because it would lower the chances of a double-dip recession and minimize the damage done to small businesses and unemployed Americans.

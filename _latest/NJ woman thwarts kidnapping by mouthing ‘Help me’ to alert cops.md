<div><p>A woman foiled a shakedown plot by kidnappers by mouthing &#8220;Help me&#8221; to a stranger in a New Jersey parking lot, police said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The dramatic encounter unfolded Friday evening while a couple was sitting in their parked car near Main and Vreeland avenues in Clifton and a stranger, who identified himself as a cop, knocked on the driver&#8217;s window, according to local police.</p>
<p>The phony lawman, 39-year-old Travis Mann, told the two they were &#8220;&#8216;breaking the law&#8217; by being intimate in a public place&#8221; and had to pony up some cash to avoid arrest, Clifton Lt. Robert Bracken said.</p>
<p>Mann told the two he was armed and ordered them to drive to an ATM to withdraw money as the kidnapper&#8217;s alleged accomplice, 45-year-old Paul Dunlop, followed behind, police said.</p>
<p>After the man withdrew cash, the woman mouthed the words &#8220;Help me&#8221; to someone who had just pulled into the bank parking lot &#8212; and they called the cops.</p>
<p>Officers rushed to the scene and rescued the couple, Bracken said.</p>
<p>Cops charged Mann and Dunlop with kidnapping, carjacking and robbery, according to Bracken.</p>
<p>Mann was also slapped with counts of impersonating a police officer and criminal coercion.</p>
<p>Mann was busted back in May by Paterson police for <a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases20/pr20200508c.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">failing to register as a sex offender</a> after causing a scene in a 7-Eleven&#160; and flouting social distancing guidelines, police said.</p>
<p>The sex offender had been previously convicted of drug possession, carjacking and robbery, court records show.</p>

<div><p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/al-iaquinta">Al Iaquinta</a> is not a fan of the way <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/dustin-poirier">Dustin Poirier</a> has handled his fight negotiations with <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a>.</p>
<p>Poirier and McGregor are targeted to rematch Jan. 23 at UFC 257, but before McGregor verbally accepted the offered date, he suggested that he and Poirier do an <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/09/conor-mcgregor-offers-to-fight-dustin-poirier-for-charity-poirier-says-lets-go">MMA charity fight</a> without the UFC&#8217;s involvement.</p>
<p>Poirier, who&#8217;s the founder of &#8220;The Good Fight Foundation,&#8221; was quick to accept McGregor&#8217;s donation of half a million dollars, as well as the offer to be flown in for an exhibition fight in Ireland.</p>
<p>Iaquinta is not one to shy away from giving his opinion and thinks Poirier showed a sign of weakness with his amicable approach toward McGregor&#8217;s suggestions.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;What is that guy doing?&#8221; Iaquinta told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssxitE3MrO4&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>. &#8220;What is he, Conor&#8217;s fan? He&#8217;s like a fan fighting Conor. It&#8217;s so cringey. Conor&#8217;s like, &#8216;I&#8217;ll fly you over, and I&#8217;ll donate my money to your charity.&#8217; I&#8217;d be like, &#8216;Bro, I&#8217;ll fly my (expletive) self over and when I beat the (expletive) out of you, I&#8217;ll donate my own money. What is this? Kumbaya? Like what the hell. Are you kidding? He&#8217;s lost the fight already.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the fight happens, there&#8217;s not a doubt in my mind Dustin&#8217;s losing that fight. He&#8217;s already (conceded) in everything. He&#8217;s like, &#8216;Thank you for the fight. We&#8217;ll fight in Ireland or wherever, and thank you, we&#8217;ll fight for charity, it&#8217;ll be great.&#8217; It&#8217;s like, dude, get out of here. This is a fight. What? Are you freakin&#8217; kidding me? You&#8217;re gonna thank the guy? You think Conor is really gonna &#8211; this is for him, this is not for you, Dustin. Relax, bro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iaquinta hasn&#8217;t competed since last October when he suffered a unanimous decision loss to Dan Hooker at UFC 243.</p>

3. A $2.5 billion investment chief highlights the stock-market sectors poised to benefit the most if stimulus is passed after the election - and says Trump ending negotiations doesn't threaten the economic recovery. The tussle in Washington over more stimulus checks for Americans will be a source of stock-market volatility in the short term, David Bahnsen said.

6. Betting against the FTSE 100 netted traders $540 million in September. These are the 5 most and least profitable short sells last month. Ortex Analytics lists the most profitable and least profitable FTSE 100 short sells for September after short-sellers make $540 million in profits.

7. United Airlines and JetBlue could soar nearly 50% on upgraded outlooks for ample cash through 2022, JPMorgan says. Despite expectations for weaker air-travel demand and weak earnings reports, JPMorgan upgraded the airline stocks.

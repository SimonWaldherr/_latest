<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Six Russian military officers have been charged in the US&#160;with carrying out 'cynical and reckless' global cyber attacks, including attempts to disrupt next year's Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The US Justice Department today said six members of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency&#160; played key roles in attacks on targets including the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea and the 2017 French elections.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were also accused of staging a malware attack called 'NotPetya' that infected computers of businesses worldwide causing nearly $1billion in losses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, they allegedly targeted investigations into the nerve agent poisoning of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter and carried out cyberattacks on media outlets and the parliament in Georgia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The US Justice Department's top national security official said&#160;the six GRU officers were responsible for 'the most disruptive and destructive series of computer attacks ever attributed to a single group'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Assistant Attorney General John Demers claimed members of the same GRU unit have been charged previously with seeking to disrupt the 2016 US elections but there were 'no election interference allegations' in this indictment.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British officials said the GRU officers planned to hack the 2020 Tokyo Olympics while posing as North Korean and Chinese cybercriminals.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They declined to give specific details about the attacks or whether they were successful, but said they had targeted Games organisers, logistics suppliers and sponsors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The plot to disrupt the Games, postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, was thwarted by British hackers, the UK Foreign Office claimed.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: 'The GRU's actions against the Olympic and Paralympic Games are cynical and reckless.&#160;We condemn them in the strongest possible terms.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The UK will continue to work with our allies to call out and counter future malicious cyber attacks.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The disclosure is designed to cause further embarrassment to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a strategy to 'call out' illegal Russian hacking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said: 'The FBI has repeatedly warned that Russia is a highly capable cyber adversary, and the information revealed in this indictment illustrates how pervasive and destructive Russia's cyber activities truly are.'&#160;</p><img id="i-249fae9149c75965"

Now, the Minneapolis-based retailer is adding measures to make shoppers feel safer on their holiday excursions.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We are doubling down on safety by adding new measures and by further innovating across our popular offerings," said Target CEO Brian Cornell.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Among the advances is an update to the Target mobile app's Wallet payment option so it can be used to checkout in a contactless manner, bypassing a scanning device. Shoppers can also check on <a href="https://www.target.com/line" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Target.com/line</a> to see if there's a line at their local store before heading out. If so, they can make a reservation and get a text message when they can enter the store.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-money-business-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Holiday shopping 2020:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/10/21/holiday-shopping-1-4-americans-already-bought-all-their-gifts/5991086002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">1 in 4 Americans already finished buying all their gifts</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Coronavirus effect:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/10/21/stimulus-talks-covid-19-spurs-declines-state-tax-revenues/3652700001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">With stimulus stalled, shortfalls in tax revenues leave states facing layoffs, service cuts</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Throughout Target stores, there will be more MyCheckout devices, which let store team members check out customers without waiting in lines.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Many of the measures just focus on contact-free shopping. It&#8217;s here to stay," Cornell said.

The total number of Drive Up spots will be doubled, expanded by nearly 8,000 more nationwide, providing more spots for drivers to pull up and have purchases brought to their cars. Guests can also change their order using Order Pickup or Drive Up even after getting to the store.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Children and adult apparel are also available for same-day delivery through its grocery delivery service Shipt.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Right now, we want to really make sure we are the easiest place to shop in America," Cornell said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Target will open at 7 a.m. on Black Friday, but its holiday season hours were not announced.

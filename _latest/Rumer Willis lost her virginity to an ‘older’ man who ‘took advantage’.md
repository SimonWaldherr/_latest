<div><p>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</p><p>Rumer Willis has opened up about the experience of losing her virginity at the age of 18, saying it happened with an &#8220;older man,&#8221; who &#8220;took advantage&#8221; of her.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old actress made her revelation on Tuesday&#8217;s episode of Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=368257957822138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;Red Table Talk&#8221; show</a>, which was taped pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I lost my virginity when I was 18, I was more concerned with the shame that I was feeling at not having done it,&#8221; Willis told Pinkett Smith in a preview. &#8220;I was not abused or it wasn&#8217;t rape, but I didn&#8217;t say yes. I wasn&#8217;t gung ho about it. But I also didn&#8217;t say no. I just let it happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unnamed man &#8220;didn&#8217;t check-in,&#8221; Willis added. &#8220;That&#8217;s where I feel like the man&#8217;s responsibility is. No means no, but what if you can&#8217;t say no?&#8221;</p>
<p>Willis didn&#8217;t elaborate further on the man&#8217;s identity.</p>

Federal prosecutors on Thursday charged six men on suspicion of conspiring to kidnap the Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. According to an FBI affidavit, the suspects "agreed to unite others in their cause and take violent action against multiple state governments that they believe are violating the U.S. Constitution," and in the process as part of their "recruitment effort" reached out to "a Michigan based militia group."

Far-right agitators have expressed anger after Whitmer carried out a statewide lockdown in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of people, many of them armed, descended on the state capitol last spring.

Emboldened by President Donald Trump who publicly embraced the groups, calling them "very good people," they occupied government property while carrying signs denouncing Whitmer and the measures meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 .

Trump also posted a series of tweets to "Liberate" several US states in lockdown, which was hailed by far-right social media users as support for the anti-government movement.

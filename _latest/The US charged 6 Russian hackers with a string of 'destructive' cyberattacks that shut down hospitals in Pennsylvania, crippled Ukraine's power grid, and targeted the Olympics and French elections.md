<p>They're all members of the GRU, a Russian intelligence agency that the FBI <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/Russian-interference-in-2016-u-s-elections">said</a> was behind Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. However, federal prosecutors did not charge the men with planning any attacks on the upcoming US election, and Brady said Monday that law enforcement doesn't have any reason to believe that Russian hackers have compromised US voting systems.</p><p>But according to the indictment, the six Russian hackers did carry out repeated attempts to sabotage Russia's perceived enemies in recent years, including a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/macron-french-presidential-campaign-says-it-was-hacked/">2017 attack on French voting infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_160313120438112&amp;key=ce074976249105acf14d8c9cf69bdcd1&amp;libId=kgguvhd301003n6p000DLaz2y8okt&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Fus-charges-Russian-hackers-over-3-of-worlds-biggest-cyberattacks%2F&amp;v=1&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fus-blames-russia-gru-sweeping-cyberattacks-georgia%2F&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;title=US%20charges%20Russian%20hackers%20over%203%20of%20world%27s%20biggest%20cyberattacks%20-%20CNET&amp;txt=%20the%20Georgian%20government%20in%202019">a string of cyberattacks against the Georgian government</a> in 2019.</p><p>In one of the most severe cases, the hackers are accused of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ukraine-cyberattack-power-grid-blackout-destruction/">disrupting Ukraine's power grid</a> in December 2015, assistant attorney general John Demers said during the press conference Monday.</p><p>"These attacks turned out the lights and turned off the heat in the middle of the Eastern European winter, as the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men, women and children went dark and cold," Demers said.</p>

<p>The six hackers are also accused of orchestrating a cyberattack against the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/27/15881666/global-eu-cyber-attack-us-hackers-nsa-hospitals">Heritage Valley Health Systems</a>, a hospital chain in Western Pennsylvania.

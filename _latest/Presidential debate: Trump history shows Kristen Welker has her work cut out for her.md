Always being picked on. Misunderstood. And being treated unfairly. You would never believe this guy is the president of the United States of America. He whines, he complains, he laments, and cries foul that everyone is against him. Especially the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump/trump-attacks-left-wing-cultural-revolution-in-mount-rushmore-address-idUSKBN2441CB" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">&#8220;left-wing&#8221;</a> media and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/trump-fake-news-counter-history-b732873.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">&#8220;fake news.&#8221;</a>&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This week&#8217;s chief victim is the moderator of Thursday night&#8217;s debate, NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker. A Black woman.&#160;&#8220;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-slams-debate-moderator-kristen-welker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Kristen Welker is terrible</a>," Trump lamented on Fox News.&#160;"I mean she is totally partisan; her father and mother are big supporters of Joe Biden for a long time. They're supporters of the Democrat Party, and she deleted her entire account."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">My response to that is, Chris Wallace, who moderated the first debate, works for Fox News. Isn&#8217;t he tied up with an ultra conservative pro-Trump network? Also, Welker did not delete her account. It is still <a href="https://twitter.com/kwelkernbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">very active on Twitter</a>.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Trump does not respect women</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If Trump&#8217;s attack were not enough, in came former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,&#160;who tweeted:&#160;&#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/1317467859824611328" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Choosing Democrat Welker</a> as a 'moderator'&#160;is one more example of why the Commission on Presidential Debates should be abolished and no Republican candidate should ever again agree to work with them.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is how Republican men treat women. It&#8217;s standard operating procedure. What a week Trump and his male sycophants had. Trump also&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/20/lesley-stahl-donald-trump-leaves-contentious-60-minutes-interview/5998366002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">attacked Leslie Stahl</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/trump-lesley-stahl-60-minutes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"></a>of CBS for conducting a "FAKE and BIASED interview" and for &#8220;not wearing a mask&#8221; as they taped a "60 Minutes" appearance.

I knew it when he failed to condemn white supremacists after Charlottesville. But what stands out to me recently are his ongoing attacks on Black women and other women of color. The president isn&#8217;t one to hold his fire for anyone, but he seems in particular to enjoy berating, belittling and bemoaning strong, independent black women. Worse, he dismisses them entirely &#8212; reinforcing America&#8217;s worst stereotypes and encouraging the most bigoted &#8212; yes, deplorable &#8212; among us not to reform, but to join in.&#8221;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/10/21/kamala-harris-name-pronunciation-david-perdue-trump-race-column/5992734002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"><strong>'Kamala-mala-mala:'</strong> If her first name is supposedly so difficult to say, try 'Sen.

Bush-Bill Clinton-Ross Perot town hall. Back then Black female network journalists like Simpson were super rare. Twenty-eight years later, Black women journalists are more common, and Welker is now headed for the moderator's seat.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Given this backdrop, we know that Welker will have her work cut out for her. So what should she&#160;do?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Judge Trump against history:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/10/21/trump-biden-debate-curve-grade-on-truth-facts-fitness-column/5991855002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">For the final debate, forget the 'Trump curve.' Grade the president on facts and truth.</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">My advice:&#160;Be 10&#160;times tougher than Savannah <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/10/savannah-guthrie-trump-town-hall-grilling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Guthrie was on Trump</a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/savannah-guthrie-trump-town-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"></a>when he tried to lie, deny&#160;or ignore her questions at the NBC town hall last week. For Welker, as a woman of color, she has to watch the ugly, old stereotypes that often plague us as strong professional Black women. She has to walk a line that Savannah Guthrie did not, namely that she can&#8217;t be too tough on Trump when he inevitably violates the debate rules or attacks her. And she can&#8217;t be too soft either.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But all of that aside, what Welker needs to do most is to be herself. She was chosen to be on that stage because she is competent and qualified. And she must be in command of that debate from the moment it starts until the moment it finishes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Sophia A.

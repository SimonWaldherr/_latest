Local lockdowns can no longer be ruled out in France, which has entered a "strong second wave" of the coronavirus epidemic, the country's prime minister has warned.

Jean Castex's stern words came as the Elysée Palace announced that President Emmanuel Macron will address the nation this evening on evening news.

The threat came as in the UK, Boris Johnson was due to unveil tough new regional lockdowns that are expected to see hundreds of pubs in the north-west of England closed for four weeks from 5pm on Wednesday.

Asked about the risks of new, more draconian orders to stay at home and close businesses over in France, the prime minister said: "Nothing can be ruled out, given what we're seeing in our hospitals."

"If over the next two weeks we see the epidemic indicators worsen, if intensive care beds fill up even more than we expect, we will indeed take additional measures," Mr Castex told France Info radio on Monday.

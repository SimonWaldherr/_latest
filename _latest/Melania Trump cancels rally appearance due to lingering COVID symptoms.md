<p>The 50-year-old nixed the trip &#8212; her first campaign-related event in more than a year &#8212; because she still has a lingering cough after her bout with the coronavirus earlier this month, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/albamonica/status/1318593679246954500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC News reporter Monica Alba</a></p>

<p>&#8220;I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time. I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief&#8217;s rally in Erie, Pa., was due to be the first lady&#8217;s first campaign event after nearly a year-long absence from the campaign trail.</p>

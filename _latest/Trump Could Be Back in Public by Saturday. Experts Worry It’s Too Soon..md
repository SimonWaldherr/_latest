All of those vital signs are within the normal range, said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious-disease physician based in South Carolina. But the numbers represent only a snapshot in time, she added. More telling would be statistics charting the president’s vital signs while he was moving around, Dr. Kuppalli said. “When he walks, does his oxygen fall?” she said. “Does his heart rate go up? Does he have to work harder? That would be important to know.”

If the president recently came off dexamethasone, a steroid normally administered only to severely sick Covid-19 patients, his well-being could take a dip in the next couple of days, Dr. Kuppalli said.

Dr. Conley’s statements on Monday suggested that Mr. Trump might be at risk through Saturday and Sunday. “We’re looking to this weekend,” he said at a news conference. “If we can get through to Monday, with him remaining the same — or improving, better yet — then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief.”

An inappropriately expedited return to the public for Mr. Trump could also imperil others through close contact.

According to C.D.C. guidelines, people with mild to moderate cases of Covid-19 most likely “remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset.” Dr. Conley’s statement cited Saturday as “day 10 since Thursday’s diagnosis.”

Dr. Tien said she was skeptical of such an assessment. The slew of treatments Mr. Trump received, she said, suggest that his disease was severe, which could extend the duration of his recommended isolation to 20 days after the onset of symptoms.

Mr. Trump might be able to end his isolation early if he tested negative for the virus, using a very accurate laboratory test, Dr. Tien said. But no such results were reported in Thursday’s memo, which mentioned only a “trajectory of advanced diagnostics.”

On last week's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kendall and Kylie Jenner got into a physical fight.

And in a teaser for this week's show, sisters Kim and Khloe Kardashian expressed that they don't want to take sides about the brawl.

The 36-year-old Khloe said the fight 'boiled over' which 'sucks' before saying 'taking a side isn't going to do anything' and that the Jenner girls were drinking at the time as 39-year-old Kim pointed out Kendall has 'anxiety.'

Hard for them all: The 36-year-old Khloe said the fight 'boiled over' which 'sucks' before saying 'taking a side isn't going to do anything'

Khloe wore a plaid shirt as she was seated in a bedroom with Kim and Kourtney during the conversation.

The three sisters seemed at a loss when it comes to the sparring between the 24-year-old Vogue model and the 23-year-old Kylie Cosmetics founder.

Khloe said that they really don't know what went on but added that there was already tension before the fight.

The girlfriend of Tristan Thompson also said that it is not fair that Corey Gamble is in the middle and now their mother Kris Jenner has to deal with the tiff. 'It just sucks for everybody,' she said but noted sisters can 'get over it.'

Kim, who is seen in a bikini top with no makeup on and her hair down, seemed to try her best to weigh the situation fairly.

Mrs Kanye West said that 'they had a sister fight' and it's 'super annoying.'

'But they were drinking and I just don't think they were being logical,' added Khloe.

Kim brought up that Kendall has anxiety 'that she struggles with' and she was shaking during the argument which took place in Palm Springs. 'That's tough,' said Kim.

The star added that the supermodel had her adrenaline running high which has not happened in a long time.

'I definitely empathize with Kendall, I have had my fair share of sister fights,' noted Khloe during her sit-down interview. 'It turns into a whole slew of emotions. I just want Kendall to feel supported but picking a side is not going to do anything right now.'

As footage of their nasty argument during a family trip to Palm Springs aired, Kylie reposted a GIF of her and Kendall kicking and punching each other in the backseat of a car as kids.

In response to the Twitter user's cheeky caption that the GIF was the 'lost footage of what was going on in that car just now,' the Kylie Cosmetics quipped it was a 'pretty accurate' representation of the evening.

Making light: Despite vowing to never speak to each other again during a heated physical fight on KUWTK, Kendall and Kylie Jenner's row appears to be water under the bridge

Kendall also retweeted the post, adding, 'Lmao! actually tho!'

While they're able to joke now, during their argument Kendall vowed to 'never speak to' Kylie again, and couldn't remain in the same car.

The quarrel happened because the Vogue cover girl was upset that Kylie took her outfit during the family getaway.

'F*** you! F*** you!' Kendall screamed at Kylie and her mother's boyfriend, Gamble, 39, who was riding with them.

'F*** you! F*** you!' Kendall, 24, screamed at Kylie, 23, (pictured) as the altercation took place

'Stop, stop, stop!' Corey yelled.

'We have to go get Kendall!' Kim told her driver, taking command. 'Turn around, sir!'

'Where are they? This is crazy!' Khloe, 36, exclaimed, as Kendall told Kylie, 'You put your f***ing heel into my f***ing neck!'

Family getaway: The row happened because Kendall was upset that Kylie took her outfit during the family getaway in Palm Springs, California

'That's cause you f***ing slapped me!' Kylie yelled back.

In a confessional, Khloe recalled, 'We're just hearing high-pitched screaming. We can't even figure out what's happening, and it just sounds really crazy.'

When Kim's car stopped, a producer ran up and told her, 'They left in the other car.'

Ride argument: Kylie and Kendall argued about riding together as their mother Kris Jenner and half-sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloe listened in

Really crazy: 'In a confessional, Khloe recalled, 'We're just hearing high-pitched screaming. We can't even figure out what's happening, and it just sounds really crazy'

'We need to find them,' said a worried looking Kourtney.

Kendall suddenly crawled into their car, swearing, 'I will never speak to Kylie again, ever.'

The fight was a horrifying moment for the whole family, not least Kris, 64, who had just been grappling with seeing Kim, Kourtney and Khlo√© fight in a recent KUWTK episode.

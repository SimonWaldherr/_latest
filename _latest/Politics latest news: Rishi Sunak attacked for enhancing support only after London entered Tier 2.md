  Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak attacked for enhancing support only after London entered Tier 2 
description: > 
  Rishi Sunak has been attacked for only bringing forward a bolstered economic support package after London entered new restrictions, with Labour claiming it is "nothing short of insulting".But his delay in acting has had "real consequences" to firms that have endured restrictions for many months already, the shadow chancellor said."Many parts of our country have spent months under Tier 2 restrictions, without adequate support," Anneliese Dodds said.The Chancellor has only caught up to the concerns of businesses when it looks like these restrictions will be affecting London and the West Midlands."Meanwhile SNP's Alison Thewliss attacked the Treasury's "disrespectful" decision to give journalists more information about the package than relevant spokespeople.

<p>Rishi Sunak has been attacked for only bringing forward a bolstered economic support package after London entered new restrictions, with Labour claiming it is "nothing short of insulting".&#160;</p>
<p>The Chancellor has cut employer contributions to the jobs support scheme (JSS), doubled support for the self-employed and pledged cash grants of up to &#163;2,100 per month&#160;for businesses in the hospitality, accommodation and leisure sector, which can be backdated to August.&#160;For the JSS, which replaces furlough, employer contributions have been cut&#160;five per cent and the minimum hours requirements dropped from a third to 20 per cent.&#160;</p>
<p>But his delay in acting has had "real consequences" to firms that have endured restrictions for many months already, the shadow chancellor said.</p>
<p>"Many parts of our country have spent months under Tier 2 restrictions, without adequate support," Anneliese Dodds said.&#160;"What has changed which means it is the right thing to do now? The Chancellor has only caught up to the concerns of businesses when it looks like these restrictions will be affecting London and the West Midlands."</p>
<p>Despite Mr Sunak telling the Commons&#160;his plan was "for the regions, for the economy, for the country", the Government's fractured relationship with regional representatives was not healed by today's announcement.&#160;</p>
<p>Andy Burnham said he could "barely believe" that support was being backdated, claiming this was something he had called for during talks that collapsed earlier this week.&#160;</p>
<p>Alex Norris, MP for Nottingham North, complained that he was being cut out of talks to place his region into Tier 3, which are set for this afternoon.&#160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile SNP's Alison Thewliss attacked the Treasury's "disrespectful" decision to give journalists more information about the package than relevant spokespeople.&#160;</p>

Humphreys came to be seen as the leading chronicler of the shifting moral and social tensions within Welsh society in the 20th century, someone who used the lives of small people to illuminate the human and national condition. Though he could write in Welsh, Humphreys wrote mainly for the English-speaking Welsh, as he was always more confident of his ability to create the subtlety he desired as a portrayer of character using English.

Yet his characters could always be assumed to be speaking Welsh and, in more than 20 novels and in volumes of poetry and short stories, he set out to be a sympathetic but unsentimental interpreter of Welsh Wales both to its own people and to the English-speaking world.

Humphreys’s most ambitious project was the Land of the Living series of seven novels beginning with National Winner (which won the 1972 Welsh Arts Council Prize) and ending with Bonds of Attachment (which was named 1992 book of the year by the Welsh Arts Council).

He set out, as he later explained, with “a simple narrative thread of a girl who begins life as an orphan and ends up a lady of the manor: one of fiction’s most basic plots … her erratic progress would need to reflect the strains and stresses of a society no longer certain of itself, swept along on a tide of transition.”

The series has come to be regarded as a major achievement of Welsh literature. Humphreys once likened himself to the character in the story of Lucas Parry, a moralising, pontificating Wesleyan lay preacher with a club foot and an “irritating habit of insisting that the Welsh, especially the nonconformist Welsh, are ‘a pattern making people’ .”

“There are sound historical reasons for this pattern-making habit,” Humphreys declared. “A small nation living for so many centuries under a state of siege – whether military, economic or cultural – needs defence in depth. There seems to me to be an intimate relationship between the ditches and ramparts of the Iron Age Celts and the stylised injunctions and commandments of the Methodists’ Cyffes Ffydd [confession of faith] and Rhodd Mam [a religious primer].”

To Humphreys, Wales’s problem was “the difficulty of continuing an identity without the apparatus that grown-up nations have to maintain their identity”, and it was Welsh poets and writers, above all, who had kept the dream, the patterns and the language alive.

The son of a schoolmaster, Emyr Owen Humphreys was born on April 15 1919 in the heavily anglicised coastal resort town of Prestatyn, Flintshire. He was brought up in nearby Trelawnyd, in an area just far enough away from the coast to retain its Welshness, although he never spoke the language as a child.

Indeed, surprisingly for one who would become known for celebrating Welsh non-conformism, his family was Church, not Chapel; his brother became a parson.

Humphreys attended Rhyl High School and studied History at Aberystwyth. The catalyst which spurred his desire to learn the Welsh language was the so-called “Llyn bombing” of 1939, an incident involving three prominent members of Plaid Cymru who, in symbolic protest at the government’s decision to erect a “bombing school” at Penyberth on the Llyn Peninsula, started a small fire at one of the government’s outbuildings, reported themselves to the police and were duly convicted of causing criminal damage.

Like many other Welsh nationalists, Humphreys registered as a conscientious objector and spent the war working on farms in Pembrokeshire and North Wales. Later in the war he served as a relief worker in the Middle East and Italy, and became an official of the Save the Children Fund under the UN. He developed a lifelong love of Italy, from which grew an ardent Welsh Europeanism.

Coming home, he completed his degree at Bangor, married, moved to Wimbledon to teach, and to write novels – partly on the encouragement of Graham Greene, who had spotted his talent and published his poems in the Spectator when he was literary editor.

His first, The Little Kingdom (1946), explored the traumatic effects of the Second World War on Wales and protested at the despoiling of the Welsh countryside.

For three years he taught, living in Chelsea for a time. But then he came up against the dilemma of whether to bring up his children as Welsh in Wales or see them assimilate in England. He returned to Wales.

The next three years were spent teaching at Pwllheli and publishing more books, including Hear and Forgive (1952), a tale of tentative friendship between a young schoolmaster and his head, which won the Somerset Maugham award.

"The American people elected Donald Trump in 2016 to nominate conservative judges. And in 2018, just a month after the controversy over Justice Kavanaugh, the American people didn&#8217;t just send up back in the majority, they expanded our majority so we could continue to confirm those judges, so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>The senator praised Barrett, saying she &#8220;did a great job last week in her hearings.

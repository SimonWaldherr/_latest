description: > 
  Oklahoma City â€” One set of human remains, and perhaps a second, have been found in a Tulsa cemetery where investigators are searching for victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, Oklahoma state archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck said Tuesday.The confirmed human remains were found little more than 3 feet underground in an area known as the "Original 18," where funeral home records show massacre victims are buried.It is not yet known if the remains, which were found in a wooden coffin, are of a victim of the massacre, Stackelbeck said.After an examination of the remains, they will be returned to the coffin and reburied, Stackelbeck said.Workers reinforce the sides of an excavation site as work continues on the excavation of a potential unmarked mass grave from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, at Oaklawn Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma, July 17, 2020.

              <p>Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum, who first proposed looking for victims of the violence in 2018 and later budgeted $100,000 to fund it after previous searches failed to find victims has said efforts will be made to find any descendants of the victims who are identified.<br> &#160;<br> Oaklawn Cemetery in north Tulsa, where a search for remains of victims ended without success in July and where the excavation resumed Monday, is near the Greenwood District where the massacre took place.</p><p>The violence took place on May 31 and June 1 in 1921, when a white mob attacked Tulsa's "Black Wall Street," killing an estimated 300, mostly Black, people and wounding 800 more while robbing and burning businesses, homes and churches.<br> &#160;<br> The massacre &#8212; which happened two years after what is known as the "Red Summer," when hundreds of African Americans died at the hands of white mobs in violence around the U.S. &#8212; has been depicted in recent HBO shows "Watchmen" and "Lovecraft County."</p></div>

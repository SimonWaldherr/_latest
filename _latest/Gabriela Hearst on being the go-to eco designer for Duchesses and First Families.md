Gabriela Hearst, the New York based designer who has been a pioneer in changing perceptions about sustainable fashion, woke up at 3am on Wednesday, French time, to watch the US presidential debate, only to discover that Dr Jill Biden was wearing one of her dresses when she appeared next to her husband.

Hearst is currently in Paris where she staged her spring summer collection yesterday, in front of a small audience (it also streamed on gabrielahearst.com), but her thoughts spin back to Tuesday’s car-crash.

“The word for that debate is tragic,” she says via Zoom. She’s sitting on the floor of her showroom by a mood-board, featuring pictures of tie-dye recycled cashmere, tassel trimmed ponchos and shirt dresses painstakingly constructed from old pieces of individually silk trimmed lace. A model in a black linen dress and a gold belt waves at me.

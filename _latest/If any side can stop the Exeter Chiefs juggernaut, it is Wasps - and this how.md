<div><p>After being cleared to play the fixture on Wednesday morning, Wasps will have had three training sessions to prepare for the Premiership final. Their opponents are Exeter Chiefs, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2020/10/17/exeter-chiefs-vs-racing-92-champions-cup-final-live-score-latest/">the European champions and a dominant domestic force this season</a>.</p>
<p>And, as could become clear when the squad is announced on Friday at midday, Wasps&#8217; selection may be compromised by an outbreak of COVID-19. The task of securing the club&#8217;s first Premiership title since 2008 is severely daunting.</p>
<p>That said, Lee Blackett&#8217;s men head to Twickenham on the back of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2020/09/07/behind-all-action-resurgence-wasps/">12 victories in 13 matches since a dreary 18-9 loss to Leicester Tigers in February</a>. They have plundered 505 points in that sequence, averaging almost 39 per outing and passing 40 in four of their last five matches. Over the same sequence, opponents have averaged less than 20 points.</p>
<p>Wasps are undeniable underdogs &#8211; you can find a 12-point handicap with some bookies &#8211; but should bring conviction and swagger to the showpiece occasion. And, because of their traits as a team, they will be confident of troubling Chiefs.</p>
<h3>Disruptive jackalling</h3>
<p>Jack Willis has enjoyed a phenomenal campaign. His record-breaking success at the breakdown can be attributed to a number of factors. Clearly, he is a sharp reader of the game. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2017/11/01/star-tomorrow-breakdown-scrapper-jack-willis-relishing-breakthrough/">An apprenticeship under Australia great George Smith shines through in his technique</a>.</p>
<p>Flexibility helps &#8211; he sometimes resembles a stooping giraffe at the watering hole as he pounces to pilfer &#8211; as does a focus from referees to ensure that attacking players do not enter breakdowns from the side.</p>

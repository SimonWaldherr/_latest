That was a slight shift in Biden's favor compared to a month ago, when the poll showed Trump with 68% support from Cuban Americans and Biden at 30%.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It wasn't a&#160;sea change by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a noticeable shift," said Fernand Amandi, a principal with Bendixen. He said it was due to a few factors, most notably a "night and day difference" from the Biden campaign in its&#160;outreach to Hispanic voters in Miami-Dade after the first poll was released.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"In the span of that four weeks, Joe Biden himself came to cultivate Hispanic voters in Florida personally&#160;three times," Amandi&#160;noted, referring to trips the Democratic nominee made to Miami&#160;&#8211; including Little Havana&#160;&#8211; as well as Tampa and elsewhere.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, also paid a visit to the state, and the campaign also increased its advertising on radio and TV, he said. And&#160;Harris was back in Florida on Monday as residents of the state began early voting.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"You guys are going to determine the outcome of this election," Harris told a crowd in&#160;Jacksonville.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Undecided voters:</strong>&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/18/donald-trumps-toughest-hurdle-2020-election-win-few-undecideds/3654305001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Donald Trump's toughest hurdle to pull off a win: Most minds are made up</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Several other players have also stepped in &#8211; including <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/13/michael-bloomberg-100-million-dollars-florida-help-biden/5784595002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Michael Bloomberg, </a>the billionaire former New York mayor who announced in September he would spent at least $100 million to help Biden in Florida.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Manny Diaz, a former Miami mayor who is advising Bloomberg's operation&#160;in Florida, said the effort has already invested in phone banking and other field work and may soon include TV and radio ads.

A&#160;<a href="https://cri.fiu.edu/research/cuba-poll/2020-fiu-cuba-poll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Florida International University survey</a> taken over the summer found that 66 percent of Cuban Americans in Miami Dade County expressed overall support for Trump's Cuba policy, although they did not like several specific changes, including the&#160;flight&#160;and visa restrictions.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>'Outrageous:'</strong>&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/10/sen-kamala-harris-urged-south-florida-vote-against-president-trump/5746030002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Kamala Harris&#160;tells Black leaders in Florida Trump must be removed</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That poll concluded Trump could expect to get&#160;59% of the Cuban-American vote in November. Schlapp noted that Trump has been able to win back a slice of younger Cuban Americans who drifted toward the Democrats during Barack Obama's two terms in the White House. She said that's due to Trump's hard line on Cuba, as well as his domestic policies that have rolled back regulations and cut taxes.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-world-6" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The FIU poll found the economy ranked as the most important policy issue among all Cuban Americans except those over 76 years old, a group that rated health care at the top of their list. "Cuba policy is ranked the sixth, that is to say, last in importance, by three of the four age groupings," the <a href="https://cri.fiu.edu/research/cuba-poll/2020-fiu-cuba-poll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">FIU researches noted.</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But for&#160;Ferrera, Trump's crackdown on Cuba has been personal. The Trump administration has limited Cuban Americans' ability to send money to family who still live in Cuba, which for Ferrera includes her half sister and a baby niece.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"My sister, she doesn&#8217;t have access to eyeglasses, and there&#8217;s no way for me to send glasses to her because of the restrictions on remittances," she said. "The new restrictions that have been put in place, they don&#8217;t hurt the regime. They hurt the Cuban people."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Ferrera came to Cuba with her parents when she was three&#160;years old. A&#160;relative in Miami picked them up in a boat&#160;after her father, a small businessman, was&#160;repeatedly jailed by the Castro government.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Her father's transgressions?&#160;"He had a little movie theater, and he would have people come to see pirated movies from the U.S." He wasn't supposed to have a business, let alone promote anything from the United States.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"No one has to explain to me what socialism, communism or authoritarianism are. I mean, my family and I, we lived it," Ferrera said. Like so many&#160;other Cuban Americans, the life lessons of fleeing oppression and building a new life in a foreign land made her acutely aware of and engaged in politics.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Daniela Ferrera on her second day in the United States.

She knocked on doors, made thousands of phone calls&#160;and idolized Cuban American politicians like Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a now-retired GOP congresswoman, and Sen. Marco Rubio.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I was just so excited about what the future of the party was going to look like," she recalled.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-world-7" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Donald Trump's 2016 campaign changed that. Ferrera says she was a "Never Trumper from Day 1" and has become disillusioned with Rubio and other Republicans.&#160;She switched her voter registration to Democrat in 2018.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In this election, she and other pro-Biden Cuban Americans helped form the Cubanos Con Biden group after becoming fed up with "socialist" and "communist" epithets that Republicans were throwing at Democrats.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mike Rivero, 30, said they felt like outliers at first. But they started a Facebook group in May, and membership swelled to 13,000 members.&#160; When they started doing caravans, they initially had 30 to 40 cars coming to pro-Biden events. Their last one, a week ago, was over 300, he said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The support is there. It&#8217;s building," Rivero said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Amore Rodriguez, 27, said she's been ostracized by much of her family after being raised as a "hard-core Republican" and switching parties.<strong></strong>She only did so after some serious soul searching prompted by an online quiz she took in college during the 2016 campaign, to figure out which presidential candidate was a good fit for her beliefs.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Ad wars:</strong>&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/16/trump-biden-campaign-ads-florida-arizona-pennsylvania-priorities-strategy/3594541001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Trump, Biden shower ad money on Phoenix, Philadelphia, Florida&#8217;s I-4 corridor in final stretch</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She was shocked when the results popped up: Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It was the biggest dissonance that I've ever experienced," Rodriguez&#160;said, adding that her first instinct was to retake the quiz. "That was the first time I had to&#160;like&#160;really look in the mirror and say 'What do you actually believe in?"</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Her upbringing had been all about patriotism and cherishing America's freedoms&#160;&#8211; one of which, she concluded, was forming her own opinions and expressing them.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"That led to a lot of arguments,"&#160;Rodriguez said. "My grandmother told me 'I&#8217;ve never been more ashamed of you &#8230; I used to be so proud of you'."&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That still stings,&#160;Rodriguez said, but now "I&#8217;ve been creating so many connections with liberal Cubans dying to find each other."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">How much impact they will have remains be to be seen.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But, said&#160;Ferrera,&#160;"As a former Republican, I feel at home in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris&#8217;&#160;party."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Contributing: Alan Gomez, Rebecca Morin, Ledyard King&#160;</p></div>

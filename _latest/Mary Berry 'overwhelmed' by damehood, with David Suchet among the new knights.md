Mary Berry has spoken of her joy at receiving a damehood in the Queen's Birthday Honours list after achieving a just a single O-Level at school.

Dame Mary said she was "absolutely overwhelmed" at the award for services to broadcasting, the culinary arts and charity during her 50-year career.

The 85-year-old has been honoured alongside dozens of heroic volunteers and key workers who fought the Covid-19 pandemic on the front line.

"For most of my life, I have been lucky enough to follow my passion to teach cookery through books and the media," she said. "I just wish my parents and brothers were here to share my joy, as my only achievement at school was just one O-Level – in cookery of course! However, I am sure they are looking down and smiling."

The actor David Suchet, perhaps best known for his upturned moustache while playing the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot during the long-running Agatha Christie television series, has been knighted for services to drama and charity after a distinguished career spanning more than half a century.

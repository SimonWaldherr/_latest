<div><p>Battling the coronavirus in winter is going to be tricky. Should you turn the heating up or down? Should windows be opened or closed? And how important is it to get the humidity right in your home?</p>
<p>A new study shows that both temperature and humidity play a key role in the survival of the virus and therefore the risk of transmission.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.16.341883v1.full.pdf" rel="nofollow">the preprint, published last week</a>, Sars-Cov-2 survives best at low temperatures in dry air. But even at warmer temperatures, droplets of the virus remain stable for far longer if the air lacks moisture (see chart).&#160;</p>
<p>Both findings will become increasingly relevant over the coming months.&#160;</p>
<p>During winter, as the air gets colder, it also dries out. But whacking on the heating indoors also reduces the amount of moisture in the air - as well as inside&#160;our sinuses. As mucus gets drier, it becomes worse at trapping infections in our airways.</p>
<p>In the study, researchers in America modelled the coronavirus' half life at a variety of different temperatures and relative humidities - a measure of the percentage of water in the air, with saturation point (when the air is most muggy) at 100 per cent.&#160;</p>

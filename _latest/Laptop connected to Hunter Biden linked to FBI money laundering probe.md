<div><p class="speakable">The FBI&#8217;s subpoena of a laptop and hard drive purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden came in connection with a money laundering investigation in late 2019, according to documents obtained by Fox News and verified by multiple federal law enforcement officials who reviewed them.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="speakable">It is unclear, at this point, whether the investigation is ongoing or if it was directly related to Hunter Biden.&#160;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ratcliffe-hunter-biden-laptop-emails-not-russian-disinformation-campaign" target="_blank">RATCLIFFE SAYS HUNTER BIDEN EMAILS, LAPTOP 'NOT PART OF SOME RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN'</a></strong></p><p>Multiple federal law enforcement officials, as well as two separate government officials, confirmed the authenticity of these documents, which were signed by FBI Special Agent Joshua Wilson.&#160;Wilson did not immediately respond to Fox News&#8217; request for comment.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>One of the documents, obtained by Fox News, was designated as an FBI &#8220;Receipt for Property&#8221; form, which details the bureau&#8217;s interactions with John Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of &#8220;The Mac Shop&#8221; who reported the laptop&#8217;s contents to authorities.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>The document has a &#8220;Case ID&#8221; section, which is filled in with a hand-written number: 272D-BA-3065729.&#160;</p><p>According to multiple officials, and the FBI&#8217;s website, &#8220;272&#8221; is the bureau&#8217;s classification for money laundering, while&#160;&#8220;272D&#8221; refers to&#160;&#8220;Money Laundering, Unknown SUA [Specified Unlawful Activity]&#8212;White Collar Crime Program,&#8221; according to FBI documents.&#160;One government official described &#8220;272D&#8221; as &#8220;transnational or blanket.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;BA&#8221; indicates the case was opened in the FBI&#8217;s Baltimore field office, sources said.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>The documents state that the subpoena&#160;was&#160;carried out&#160;in Wilmington, Del., which falls under the jurisdiction of the FBI&#8217;s Baltimore Field Office.&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;The FBI cannot open a case without predication, so they believed there was predication for criminal activity,&#8221; a government official told Fox News. &#8220;This means there was sufficient evidence to believe that there was criminal conduct.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Another document, obtained by Fox News, was a subpoena sent to Isaac to testify before U.S. District Court in Delaware on Dec. 9, 2019.

  Human remains found at suspected 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre mass grave site 
description: > 
  Archaeologists have found human remains during an excavation of what researchers suspect to be a mass grave site from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre at a city cemetery.It’s unclear whether the human remains are connected to the 1921 massacre, but archaeologists are only beginning to examine the remains.“I am very grateful to have the foremost experts in the country working to locate the remains of victims from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre,” Bynum said on Facebook Tuesday.The Tulsa Race Massacre, sometimes referred to as the Tulsa race riots, began on May 31, 1921, after a black teenager named Dick Rowland was falsely accused of having assaulted a white woman.The Tulsa Race Massacre received renewed attention last year after HBO’s “Watchmen” series recreated the two-day event in its pilot episode, using the disturbing historical incident to set the tone for its season.

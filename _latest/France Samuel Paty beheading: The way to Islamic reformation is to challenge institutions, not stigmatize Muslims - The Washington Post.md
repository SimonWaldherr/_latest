  France Samuel Paty beheading: The way to Islamic reformation is to challenge institutions, not stigmatize Muslims - The Washington Post 
description: > 
  The Macron fiasco didn’t overshadow the problem of violence in the name of Islam for long.Mahfouz and Paty are neither the first nor the last victims of this interpretation of Islam.Islamic institutions such as Al-Azhar often denounce that violence and insist that its perpetrators do not represent “true Islam,” as Egypt’s mufti just did.Does it allow Muslims to uphold modern political institutions and their laws?Challenging these institutions and movements will help, not undermine, the debate among Muslims over what Islam is — the debate that will shape the future of Islam.

<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macron-islam-france/2020/10/02/ba8a1dcc-04bc-11eb-b92e-029676f9ebec_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_4">Macron&#8217;s speech of Oct. 2</a> wasn&#8217;t supposed to be a criticism of Islam. It was a policy statement about cracking down on &#8220;radical Islamist&#8221; influence among French Muslims to prevent their transformation into a &#8220;counter-republican&#8221; community. However, Macron&#8217;s bizarre remark that Islam &#8220;is in crisis all over the world today&#8221; unsurprisingly got most of the attention in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/2/macron-announces-new-plan-to-regulate-islam-in-france">Middle East</a>. The response was swift.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">What was meant to be a debate about combating Islamic radicals in France turned into an outcry against &#8220;Macron&#8217;s stigmatization of Islam.&#8221; Nuanced Muslim voices got lost in the noise.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The Macron fiasco didn&#8217;t overshadow the problem of violence in the name of Islam for long. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gruesome-details-emerge-in-beheading-of-french-teacher-who-showed-students-mohammed-cartoons/2020/10/17/9bcaeedc-107b-11eb-b404-8d1e675ec701_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9" target="_blank">beheading</a> of a schoolteacher, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/teacher-in-paris-suburb-killed-and-decapitated-allegedly-after-showing-cartoons-of-prophet-mohammad-in-class/2020/10/16/3d4d8be0-0fd5-11eb-b404-8d1e675ec701_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9" target="_blank">Samuel Paty</a>, on Oct. 16 for showing his students images of a caricature depicting Islam&#8217;s prophet came as a crude reminder of the problem. Calling it an isolated act, as the <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/388531/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt%E2%80%99s-grand-mufti-condemns-killing-of-Paris-teac.aspx">grand mufti of Egypt did</a>, doesn&#8217;t cut it any longer. Nor does the lamentation over French atrocities in Algeria half a century ago. The problem of violence motivated by a certain interpretation of Islam is real.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Twenty-six years before Paty&#8217;s beheading, Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz narrowly escaped the same fate in Cairo for &#8220;insulting Islam&#8221; in one of his novels. The attacker who stabbed him was following a ruling by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/books/mahfouz-nobelwinning-novelist-is-stabbed-in-cairo.html">leading Muslim cleric</a>. Mahfouz and Paty are neither the first nor the last victims of this interpretation of Islam.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Three key premises held by the Islamic Salafist tradition lie at the source of the problem. First, the idea that sovereignty lies with &#8220;God,&#8221; not the people, restricts the role of legislatures to enacting Islamic law, which is also understood in its most literalist interpretation. Rulers who don&#8217;t uphold this principle are deemed idolatrous. Second, Muslims&#8217; &#8220;apostasy,&#8221; often defined as having a different interpretation of their faith, is punishable by death. Third, when Muslim leaders fail to enact these rules, individual Muslims have a duty, under certain conditions, to carry them out themselves.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">These interpretations of Islam underpin most of the violence in its name, since the Egyptian scholar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/magazine/the-philosopher-of-islamic-terror.html">Sayyid Qutb</a> wrote his <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Princeton_Readings_in_Islamist_Thought.html?id=2hxmm2N6jOgC">call for Jihad</a> more than half a century ago, all the way to the Islamic State and &#8220;lone wolves&#8221; violently punishing those who &#8220;insult Islam&#8221; today. Islamic institutions such as Al-Azhar often denounce that violence and insist that its perpetrators do not represent &#8220;true Islam,&#8221; as Egypt&#8217;s mufti just did. Yet they rarely address the intellectual foundations of these belligerent interpretations of Islamic texts.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Independent-minded Islamic thinkers have long been advocating more clement readings of Islam, its laws and its relationship with non-Muslims. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Abduh">Muhammad Abduh</a> in the 19th century to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46mt56?refreqid=excelsior%3A0ecce3d0814c8becf8919dc46ddbb084">Nasr Abu Zayd, Mohammed Arkoun and many others</a> more recently, thinkers have critically reviewed Islamic jurisprudence to show its emphasis on reason, individual freedom and equality. But religious institutions and movements did not follow their lead. And political leaders, including those of the so-called secular regimes, hedged their bets and walked a fine line between reformers and Salafists. Decades of social, economic and political decay, foreign encroachment and military interventions, along with Saudi support, helped Salafi thought grow. Today, Salafi thought is no longer a fringe: It has penetrated mainstream religious institutions as well as the Islamist movements that had started off as modernist, such as the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Those who are interested in promoting a reformist vision of Islam should challenge the foundations of Salafism within these institutions and movements &#8212; not &#8220;Islam&#8221; as a whole, as Macron did, nor the already stigmatized Muslim minorities who are struggling with racism and discrimination in Western countries.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Instead, Islamic institutions and movements should be pressed to come up with unambiguous answers to the key questions that Salafism poses: Does their interpretation of &#8220;true Islam&#8221; allow Muslims to use violence against others? Does it allow Muslims to uphold modern political institutions and their laws? Does it allow Muslims to live peacefully with people they consider apostates or infidels?</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Challenging these institutions and movements will help, not undermine, the debate among Muslims over what Islam is &#8212; the debate that will shape the future of Islam.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><b>Read more:</b></p></div>

<p>It turns out a massive flood control project is an excellent way to unearth dinosaurs. At least, that's what happened back in 1993 in Coralville, Iowa.</p><p>In 1993, Coralville, Iowa, experienced 28 days of rain. More than 17,000 cubic feet of water flowed over a spillway, wiping out the state's yearly crop of soybeans and corn. Roads were obliterated, people's lives were in jeopardy, and the city was literally drowning.</p><p>The Coralville Dam was built in the 1950s by the US Army Corps of Engineers to help provide flood protection for the Iowa River Valley to the south. It was named after the city, which had weirdly received its name from the ancient fossilized reefs that stud the river's limestone.</p><p>Once the rains stopped and the citizens of the city could step outside without being swept away, the Corps returned to the site to assess the damage and explore the choices for reconstructing the dam. What they discovered shocked everyone.</p>

<p>The Corps discovered that the floods eroded five feet of limestone from the edge of the spillway. This created a gorge and unearthed several fossil beds, most of which were about 375 million years old.</p><p>

        The US Army Corps of Engineers and the Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of Natural History celebrated the arrival of the Wankel Tyrannosaurus rex,  the Smithsonian&#8217;s first ever T. rex, on April 15, 2014.

</p><p>The fossils were mainly marine creatures that had once lived in the sea that used to cover Iowa. Because the Corps discovered them, all the sea creatures immediately became the property of the US Army.</p><p>That's not to say that the Army will be opening a theme park filled with these fossils any time soon, but it's pretty exciting to think that the Army has done its part to help advance the field of paleontology.</p><p>The survey archaeologist for the Corps, Nancy Brighton, said that the collection spans the entire paleontological record. So anything relating to animals and the natural world that existed before humans are included in that.</p>

<p>Because the Corps of Engineers manages more than 8 million acres of land across the United States, finds like the one in Iowa aren't super uncommon. In fact, the Corps also owns one of the most intact T. rex skeletons ever found. More on that later.</p><p>All thanks in part to the Flood Control Act, signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 that decreed the need for dams, levees, and dikes all across the country. But before construction could begin on those early-iteration dams, the Corps had to complete a thorough survey. Those surveys almost always exposed ancient fossil beds.</p><p>In fact, it's assumed that most of what American archaeologists have discovered are thanks in part to the efforts of the Corps. All of the hydropower and flood control projects that started back in the 1950s certainly paved the way for new discoveries.</p><p>The greatest of all of these discoveries didn't happen way back, though. It was just a few decades ago, in 1988, on Labor Day. That morning, Kathy Wankel, a hiker, and amateur fossil collector, was trekking through Montana's Fort Peck Reservoir when something caught her eye.</p><p>

        Montana&#8217;s T.rex is the most completely mounted T.rex fossil, not a cast or a replica.

</p><p>At first, she thought it was a shoulder blade pushing up through the rocky soil. The lighting was perfect, according to Wankel, which allowed her to see the webby pattern of bone marrow, and that's when she knew she'd discovered something big.</p>

<p>And by big, of course, we mean enormous. Wankel and her husband had stumbled on the remains of a T. rex thought to have roamed the Montana area some 66 million years ago. The discovery that Wankel and her husband made was one of just eight at the time. Since then, about 50 other skeletons have been discovered.</p><p>It took nearly a year to figure out who owned the land where the skeleton was found. At long last, the Corps began to dig. It took several years and a large team to unearth the 38-foot skeleton weighing in at nearly six tons.</p><p>The most astonishing part? It was almost 100% complete, making it the first specimen to be discovered with small lower arm bones fully intact.</p><p>Since 2017, the T. rex has called the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History home. The Corps of Engineers has agreed to a 50-year loan to ensure that all Americans have a chance to see it &#8212; when the world's not locked down with COVID, at least.</p>

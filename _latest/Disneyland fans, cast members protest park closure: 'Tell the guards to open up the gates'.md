description: > 
  A few dozen Disneyland enthusiasts and cast members gathered outside the park Saturday to protest its closure, which has meant the loss of more than 28,000 jobs across both of Disney's U.S. theme parks."Cast members don't want to lose their dream jobs," Natasha Ramirez, co-organizer for the protest, told USA TODAY."It's better to have Disneyland open just like all the other ones are and allow the cast members to choose if they want to return or not, instead of not having a choice at all and being laid off.""People ... think we just want Disneyland open so we can go buy a churro," she said.Gavin Newsom said Disneyland and surrounding large theme parks wouldn't reopen anytime soon.

"Tell the guards to open up the gates," one sign read, quoting a line from "Frozen." "Oh bother! Why is Disney still closed?" another asked with a picture of Winnie the Pooh.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Ramirez, a former cast member, launched the protest along with Desi d'Amani, one of the thousands of Disney workers laid off last month.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We started this event in response to the layoff in hopes of getting Disneyland back open&#160;so no more layoffs will happen and so that those who were recently laid off might be able to go back," Ramirez said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Though some on social media criticized those protesting as people who&#160;just&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/WilHoppe/status/1317527747871281152" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">"miss taking pictures in Disneyland,"</a> Ramirez maintains that wasn't the spirit of the event.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-news-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"People ... think we just want Disneyland open so we can go buy a churro," she said.

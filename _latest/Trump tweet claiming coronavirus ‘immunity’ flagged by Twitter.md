Twitter on Sunday flagged a post in which President Trump claimed that he is now “immune” to the coronavirus — the latest message from the commander-in-chief marked as violating the social-media site’s rules.

“This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19,” reads the message that users now have to click through in order to access the original post. “However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.”

The move also disables all ways of interacting with the tweet, except for retweeting it with a comment.

In the message, Trump wrote that he has received a “total and complete sign off” from White House doctors and that he is now “immune” to the virus that has thus far killed nearly 215,000 Americans.

Trump similarly declared himself “immune” during a morning appearance on Fox News but clarified that he didn’t know how long that immunity would last.

Researchers have said that it appears possible for someone to contract COVID-19 again within months of beating the bug.

Trump, who has previously had tweets flagged by the site, has accused it of tweaking its algorithm against him andd other conservative voices.

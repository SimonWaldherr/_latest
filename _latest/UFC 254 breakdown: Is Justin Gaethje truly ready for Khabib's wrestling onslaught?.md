  UFC 254 breakdown: Is Justin Gaethje truly ready for Khabib's wrestling onslaught? 
description: > 
  Given Gaethje’s on-paper edges within the striking realm, it’s hard to imagine a world where Nurmagomedov goes against his stated game plan of ground warfare.But in order to get things to the floor, the former sambo champion will first need to show the ability to win wrestling exchanges, which – against Gaethje – is easier said than done.Gaethje also does a good job at framing off his opponent’s hips in close quarters, utilizing solid head position to help steer in his desired direction.Whenever Gaethje’s opposition has been able to get deep on a takedown attempt, he is quick to utilize an overhook as he looks to separate grips with his spare hand, bellying down when necessary.Typically resetting his base through tripod variations to stand, Gaethje could end up giving Nurmagomedov what he wants in regards to getting a lock around his hips.

But in order to get things to the floor, the former sambo champion will first need to show the ability to win wrestling exchanges, which &#8211; against Gaethje &#8211; is easier said than done.</p>
<p>An unforgiving clinch fighter, the former Division I All-American wrestler has the hip triggers to stop deep takedown attempts while still maintaining the aggressive wherewithal to throw uppercuts and leg kicks in small spaces, consistently striking and making his opposition pay off the breaks (from either stance). Gaethje also does a good job at framing off his opponent&#8217;s hips in close quarters, utilizing solid head position to help steer in his desired direction.</p>
<p>Whenever Gaethje&#8217;s opposition has been able to get deep on a takedown attempt, he is quick to utilize an overhook as he looks to separate grips with his spare hand, bellying down when necessary. Although there is nothing wrong with this defense from a fundamental standpoint, I&#8217;m still not entirely sure how much underhook play Gaethje will want to give a guy like Nurmagomedov.</p>
<p>Primarily predicating his offense off of the establishment of an underhook or the grasp of a lower extremity, Nurmagomedov is OK with failing on his first shot so that he can push his opposition toward the fence. Even on the occasion of an opponent establishing an underhook of their own, Nurmagomedov is quick to collapse the perceived leverage point, often looking to tip opposition to that very same side.</p>
<p>Whether Nurmagomedov is hitting trips and tosses from the bodylock or going through his single-leg repertoire of high-crotch lifts to crackdowns, the Dagestani fighter can chain through it all so long as he can work from the fence. And if he is able to break through the American&#8217;s first layer of defense to get him down, then Nurmagomedov&#8217;s style of positional rides should have a lot of play against the folk-style wrestling tactics that fuel Gaethje&#8217;s get-up sensibilities.</p>
<p>Typically resetting his base through tripod variations to stand, Gaethje could end up giving Nurmagomedov what he wants in regards to getting a lock around his hips.</p>
<p>Even when opponents use this position to entice bad back-takes in transition, Nurmagomedov is too smart to take the bait, as he instead opts to shuck his opponent forward, keeping them heavy on their hands. Not only does this approach preoccupy limbs in an exhausting fashion, but it also allows Nurmagomedov the luxury of more secure entries to a back mount.</p>
<p>But if a fighter doesn&#8217;t make it that far off of the mat, then that probably means that Nurmagomedov is crushing their spirits through unforgiving wrist-rides, looking to pick posts and collapse their base anytime they attempt to stand (all while making time to both squawk and strike at his caught prey, of course).</p>
<p>I will, however, be curious to see if Gaethje looks to dust off the granby rolls that got him out of sticky situations with Luiz Firmino &#8211; especially when considering the success Abel Trujillo had against Nurmagomedov with said technique. It was a big reason why I liked Tony Ferguson&#8217;s chances to give Nurmagomedov problems, as I believe that Gaethje, too, can make hay with it inside of scrambles.</p>
<p>The more pressing question for me, though, is not whose grappling will win out the battle; but whose grappling ability will last longer in a potential five-round war?</p>

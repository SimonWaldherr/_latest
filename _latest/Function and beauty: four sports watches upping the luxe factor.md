The 'sports luxe' sector originated in the early 1970s, when famed watch designer Gérald Genta fused everyday materials with immaculate finishing to fill the gap between tool and dress watches. While Genta's original creations favoured stainless steel, as the years have rolled by watchmakers have significantly upped the luxe factor.

The Genta-designed Audemars Piguet Royal Oak is the timepiece that started the sports-luxe revolution in 1972. In its latest version, the familiar octagonal steel case and tapisserie face have been replaced with hammered rose-gold, housing a series of layered blue circles that create an optical illusion of depth, emanating from the diamond-set, flying tourbillon cage.

While precision and accuracy rule at Rolex, style and elegance are never far behind. With a host of ocean-friendly features including 100m water-resistance and a robust Oysterflex bracelet, the Yacht-Master is designed for serious nautical adventure. An array of precious-metal cases provide the glamour, while a pavé-diamond-dial version is the ultimate in aquatic chic.

Chopard's Alpine Eagle collection was launched last year with the tagline 'rebirth of an icon', referring to the brand's first sports timepiece, the St Moritz, from 1980. Reimagined for 21st-century men and women, it is at its most decadent in a diamond-set, rose-gold case with matching bracelet and Tahitian mother-of-pearl dial.

A chronograph with Nasa approval, the Omega Speedmaster embraced its feminine side in 2017 with the highly accomplished and decorative 38mm models. Meeting both the technical requirements of a mechanical stopwatch and the aesthetic demands of contemporary women, the 38mm is now available for the first time in a full gold case, with or without a diamond bezel.

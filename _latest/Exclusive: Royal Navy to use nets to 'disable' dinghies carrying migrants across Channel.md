In his first newspaper interview since being appointed by Priti Patel in August, Mr O'Mahoney said the current facilities for processing migrants were under a "significant amount of pressure".

His remarks came after it emerged that the Government was considering using offshore holding centres, disused prisons or retired ferries to temporarily accommodate those who reach the UK illegally.

He also suggested that there was a case for increasing sentences for those involved in facilitating illegal crossings, stating: "I think it's rare for a law enforcement official to say that they think the sentences are sufficient."

The number of clandestine arrivals is exceeding 300 per day - the greatest numbers on record - after a sharp decrease in travel by air and rail during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The four stages of the plan comprise:

Attempting to stop the flow of migrants from Africa and the Middle East into northern France; Reducing the number leaving the region for the UK, including by helping to dismantle camps; Physically preventing entry to the UK; Reforming the country's asylum system to reduce Britain's "pull factor".

Describing progress on the third stage of the plan, Mr O'Mahoney, a former Royal Marine who was previously director of the Joint Maritime Security Centre, said: "We are exploring tactics to make safe interventions, in order to return migrants back to France."

He added: "We definitely are very, very close to being able to operationalise a safe return tactic where we make an intervention safely on a migrant vessel, take migrants on board our vessel and then take them back to France. The problem with that currently is that the French won't accept them back to France."

Asked whether the method mirrored a method trialled by the Royal Navy in which nets were used to clog propellers and bring the boats to a standstill, Mr O'Mahoney said: "It's that type of thing, yes. So, safely disabling the engine and then taking the migrants on board our vessel."

The tactic is one of many "which we may deploy over the next few months. But given that we're not using them yet I'm not at liberty to go into detail about them ... We are working with maritime security departments across law enforcement and military, everywhere across government and come up with new tactics to tackle this problem.

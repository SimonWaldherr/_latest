I was honored to be a guest in Nelson Mandela's family box at the opening session of the new South African Parliment in 1994.

His legacy is one of persistence, a trait that will be vital in achieving social justice.

The movements of this past summer remind me of the arrest of Nelson Mandela in August of 1962 and his subsequent imprisonment, as well as the joy so many of us felt upon his release 28 years later in 1990. In 1994, I was privileged to be a guest in the Mandela family box at the opening session of the newly democratically elected South African Parliament.

Nelson Mandela's legacy brings home the power of both individuals and corporations to force change inside a reluctant nation. In the wake of George Floyd's death, the spotlight on hate speech and misinformation on social media, and the recognition that environmental and economic priorities are not mutually exclusive, Mandela's personification of how human persistence can overcome the greatest adversities continues to be an inspiration.

Justice is a difficult path

Taking a stand for justice will almost certainly bring you backlash. Justice often represents change, and oppressors typically like how things already are.

Consider what's happened in the United States in just the past few months. Less than a year ago, professional basketball and football players were vilified for kneeling in support of the Black Lives Matter movement; this year, US sports leagues are encouraging these protests. The NBA is allowing players to wear social justice messages on the back of their jerseys.

Last year, social media sites were citing First Amendment excuses for allowing distortions and hate-filled rhetoric to go unchecked; today, the world's most powerful social networking sites are being pressured into acknowledging they have a responsibility to call out posts that promote lies or hate.

None of this has happened in a vacuum. It rose from the ground up, beginning with tens of thousands of street protests supporting the Blacks Live Matter movement, which became a clarion call not only to sports leagues, but also politicians, police departments, and corporate executives.

In recent months, social media sites have finally begun to flag hate speech and disinformation on their platforms, but only after a civil rights coalition led by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the NAACP launched a #StopHateforProfit campaign calling on major corporations to put a pause on advertising on Facebook. Within days, the outdoor apparel brands Patagonia, North Face, and REI, followed by giants like Adidas, Clorox, and Starbucks, announced they would join the advertiser boycott.

By taking a stand, these companies will no doubt take some heat, just as I did when in 1976, as CEO of Volvo, I decided there were no circumstances under which continuing to do business with South Africa's brutally repressive governmental system could be justified. My actions in divesting Volvo were not without consequences, raising the ire of my colleagues and Volvo shareholders, since our operations at the Durban plant were quite profitable. More troublesome was that for our South African workers, the closing of the plant meant the loss of hard-to-come-by employment.

I was painfully aware that the long-term gamble of creating pressure on the apartheid regime meant imposing hardship in the short term on the very people I wished to support. I also worried that with so few other companies taking similar action, my divestment decision might be merely a drop in a very large bucket, without real impact. In the ensuing decade, however, attitudes changed greatly. By the mid-1980s, there was a global movement to topple apartheid, and by 1988, both GM and Ford had divested from South Africa.

History has borne out that divestment was a successful weapon against apartheid. Inherent in that success was the scope of the movement, a collaborative effort that spanned politics, industry, and educational institutions. Today's climate is reminiscent of those achievements.

In addition to advertising boycotts and a groundswell to reform police departments, divestment proponents, like their anti-apartheid predecessors, have organized to create pressure on investors to divest from the largest oil and gas firms, and to invest instead in sources of renewable energy.

As with the move against apartheid, some of the most significant divestment actions are taking place at colleges and universities, as students pressure their institutions to sell off their holdings in fossil fuel companies and instead make investments based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles.

ESG investing has increased in the US by almost 40% in the last three years. Just this month, London-based BP announced it will transform itself by halting oil and gas exploration in new countries, slashing oil and gas production by 40%, lowering carbon emissions by about a third, and boosting capital spending on low-carbon energy tenfold, to $5 billion a year.

The paradigm of anti-apartheid divestment reminds us how the collective push of dedicated individuals and select institutions over time can result in a tipping point of the global mindset. Once that tipping point occurred, the system of apartheid—a force that had once seemed unstoppable—was categorically dismantled within a matter of years. The same can be true of the most important issues of our time.

Protests and boycotts are as old as America itself. The Boston Tea Party, when American Patriots protested taxation without representation by dumping chests of tea into the Boston Harbor, soon escalated into the American Revolution. As those early Americans knew then, as South Africa's Nelson Mandela understood 200 years later, and as Sweden's young Greta Thunberg seems so adroitly to recognize today, extraordinary accomplishments on the global scale depend not on individual or corporate efforts alone, but on combined and coordinated action undertaken by parties who are in the best sense disinterested in any partisan or nationalistic sense.

Whether determining how to invest or disinvest, choosing to protest or boycott, or minimizing one's own environmental impact, no drop in the bucket is too small or inconsequential. Intelligent idealists the world over can avert disaster by combining forces, despite the powerful forces against them, in the knowledge that they are on the right side of history.

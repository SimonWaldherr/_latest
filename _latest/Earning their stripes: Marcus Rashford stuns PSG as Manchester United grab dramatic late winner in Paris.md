<div><p>Once again it was Marcus Rashford, Paris and a famous victory for Manchester United. As with 19 months ago it was the striker who scored the crucial goal to defeat Paris Saint-Germain. That previous performance was their best-ever under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and this win their finest display since then.</p>
<p>It may have only been a Champions League group game, rather than a last-16 tie, but it was another famous European night as they defeated last season&#8217;s finalists. They also inflicted PSG&#8217;s first home defeat in the group stages since 2004.</p>
<p>In doing so they gave their chance of progressing from Group H, which includes RB Leipzig and Istanbul Basaksehir and looks a tough proposition, a significant boost.</p>
<p>Once more it rained in Paris and although the atmosphere &#8211; in front of an empty stadium rather than a raucous band of away supporters who sang &#8220;Ole&#8217;s at the wheel&#8221; &#8211; was very different United and Solskjaer will saviour it and not least because the manager got his tactics, including not starting with Paul Pogba, right.</p>
<p>There were some crucial saves from David De Gea and an excellent performance from Axel Tuanzebe on his Champions League debut but they deserved this with Rashford, who scored the injury-time penalty to knock out PSG two seasons ago, striking a wonderful winning goal.</p>

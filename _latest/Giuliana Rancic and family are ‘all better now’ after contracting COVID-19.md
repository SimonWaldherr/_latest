<div><p>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</p><p>Giuliana Rancic has recovered from her bout with coronavirus.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old TV personality shared the good news with a concerned fan Friday on Instagram, <a href="https://people.com/health/giuliana-rancic-gives-coronavirus-recovery-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to People</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you feeling from the Covid?&#8221; the user asked Rancic on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are through it and all better now. Thank you for asking. We appreciate it,&#8221; Rancic replied.</p>
<p>Last month, Rancic informed the public that she and her family <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/09/20/guilana-rancic-reveals-she-tested-positive-for-covid-19-in-emmys-video/">had contracted coronavirus</a> shortly before the Emmy Awards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, everyone. As I go into my 20th year on the E! red carpet I have to say I do not take missing an award show lightly, but unfortunately, this year is just so different,&#8221; Rancic said in an Instagram video she issued on Sept. 20 &#8211; the same day as the Emmys.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of E! and NBCUniversal&#8217;s very strict testing guidelines, especially before an event like this, I did find out that I tested positive for COVID-19,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Now, as much as I didn&#8217;t want to hear that, I&#8217;m very thankful I heard it before I traveled and possibly could have exposed other people. So for that, I&#8217;m thankful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rancic&#8217;s husband Bill, 49, and son Duke, 8, were infected as well, she said at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all doing well and taking care of each other so I&#8217;m going to get back to doing that. But I just want to say I&#8217;m wishing you all the best and please protect yourselves and protect those around you,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Take good care and I&#8217;ll see you on the next red carpet.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2011, Rancic underwent a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after being diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>
<p>Breast cancer patients who are undergoing treatment may have a &#8220;weakened&#8221; immune system that could increase the &#8220;risk of getting sick from COVID-19,&#8221; <a href="https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/coronavirus-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Susan G. Komen</a>, a global nonprofit breast cancer organization.</p>

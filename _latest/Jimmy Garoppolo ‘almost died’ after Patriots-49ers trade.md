<div><p>Jimmy Garoppolo&#8217;s NFL career took a turn when the Patriots traded him to the 49ers on Halloween in 2017, but on his way to the airport for his first early Oct. 31 flight to San Francisco, he quite literally veered off the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;A car jumped off the exit ramp, and was coming downhill at us, toward the driver&#8217;s side window,&#8221; Garoppolo said on <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/jimmy-garoppolo-recalls-scary-car-ride-after-trade-49ers-patriots" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC Sports Bay Area&#8217;s &#8220;49ers Talk.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I just saw headlights and the driver reacted, got us off into a ditch. It happened so fast. I&#8217;m in a panic in the backseat, like, &#8216;Holy &#8230; we almost just died, man.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Garoppolo, who returns to Foxborough this weekend for the first time to face his former team, was lucky to have the right person behind the wheel. It was what the driver said next that the 28-year-old quarterback says he&#8217;ll always remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;The driver turned around &#8212; I&#8217;ll never forget it &#8212; he was like, &#8216;Whoa! That was awesome!&#8217; &#8221; Garoppolo recalled. &#8220;And I was like, &#8216;That was not awesome. That was crazy. But great job!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an interesting morning. Definitely a great start to coming out west.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 49ers made their first call to the Patriots after Garoppolo&#8217;s third season in New England, but were denied. During the 2017 season, the Pats seemingly felt they were unable to both retain Tom Brady and pay Garoppolo the price to keep him as an impending unrestricted free agent. That&#8217;s when trade speculation began, but Garoppolo said he tried not to pay any attention to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of one of those things, during the season, we&#8217;re so swamped with game plans and just everything you&#8217;re doing on a day-to-day basis that you can&#8217;t get caught up in that,&#8221; Garoppolo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember initially I was a little bit, just thinking about it and reading all this stuff. Then, I was like, &#8216;Dude, I&#8217;m never going to be able to survive this season if I keep thinking about it,&#8217; so it was kind of on the back burner, out of sight, out of mind.&#8221;</p>

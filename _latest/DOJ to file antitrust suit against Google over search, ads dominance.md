<div><p>The Justice Department plans to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google parent Alphabet on Tuesday, accusing the search juggernaut of maintaining an illegal monopoly on the lucrative online search business.</p>
<p>The lawsuit will allege that Google broke the law to keep its own search engine dominant and accuses the tech giant of disadvantaging competitors in an effort to sell more online search ads.</p>
<p>Alleged tactics will include a massive contract worth billions of dollars with Apple to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone, as well as ensuring that its search engine is pre-loaded onto smartphones using Alphabet&#8217;s Android operating system, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html">New York Times reports</a>.</p>
<p>Eleven state attorneys general, all of whom are Republican, are participating in the lawsuit, including AGs for Florida, Georgia and Texas.</p>
<p>Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/03/doj-reportedly-planning-google-antitrust-suit-by-end-of-month/">since last year</a> been digging into Google&#8217;s search business and its advertising business, which claims about a third of the world&#8217;s spending on online ads, as well as 90 percent of the market for ad tech tools, which publishers use to sell advertising space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first lawsuit to emerge from a Trump administration review of tech industry, including Facebook, Amazon and Apple Inc.</p>
<p>Google was previously the subject of an antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission over its search product, but the agency ended that probe in 2013, despite FTC staff having recommended the agency bring a case <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-u-s-antitrust-probe-of-google-1426793274">after reportedly finding</a> &#8220;real harm to consumers and innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attorney General Bill Barr has reportedly taken a personal interest in the case and receives periodic updates on it from an aide.</p>
<p>The Justice Department will hold a briefing on the lawsuit at 9:45 a.m.</p>
<p>Shares of Alphabet were mostly flat in pre-market trading, down just 0.2 percent.</p>

<div><p>An alleged member of the Black Lives Matter movement was dangling from a rope off Chicago&#8217;s Trump Tower Sunday night &#8212; demanding to speak to the president and the media, a report said.</p>
<p>The unidentified man, who appeared to be in his 20s, was seen hanging off the side of the riverfront skyscraper at 5:30 p.m. local time, remaining there for hours as police negotiators tried to talk him to safety, the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/10/18/21522344/person-hanging-off-trump-tower-demanding-speak-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Sun-Times reported</a>.</p>
<p>Police told the newspaper that the man threatened suicide and voiced a desire to speak with Trump and the media.</p>
<p>Later Sunday night, a video message from what appeared to be the man began circulating on social media.</p>
<p>Filmed while hanging from an orange rope &#8212; and at one point acknowledging he&#8217;s in Chicago &#8212; the man identifies himself as a Black Lives Matter member with a message for Trump, according to footage <a href="https://twitter.com/TheInsiderPaper/status/1318013257987346433?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared by Inside Paper</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to die. If someone will try to pull this rope, I will jump and die,&#8221; the man said, panning the camera down for a view of the Chicago River.</p>
<p>The man also points the camera at the top of the building, where a person could be seen and heard trying to communicate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a knife. If someone will try to pull [the rope], I will cut it and I will probably die. But I don&#8217;t want to die,&#8221; the man said with a knife in hand.</p>
<p>The man did not make clear what he wished to speak to Trump about, but said, &#8220;If Mr. Trump, he promise something, he should do before the election.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone who knows me. They know I am not crazy. I am not crazy. I am well-educated guy. But &#8230; Mr. Trump, if you think I am crazy, I am not crazy. And if you will not talk with me, I will cut, I will die,&#8221; he says.</p>

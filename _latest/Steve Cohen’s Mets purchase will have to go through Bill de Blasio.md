<div><p>Hal Steinbrenner isn&#8217;t the only prominent New York figure who will have a say in the sale of the Mets to Steve Cohen. None other than Bill de Blasio also gets a turn at bat, thanks to the terms of the Citi Field lease.</p>
<p>However, much like Steinbrenner, the Yankees&#8217; managing general partner, New York City&#8217;s mayor is expected to support Cohen&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/steve-cohen-clears-huge-mlb-hurdle-toward-finalizing-mets-purchase/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">effort to purchase his childhood favorite ballclub</a> from the Wilpons for $2.4 billion. A 30-day window for de Blasio to sign off on the sale began last Friday, although the city&#8217;s byzantine regulations allow the clock to be restarted.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just due diligence,&#8221; a City Hall source said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see this impacting the final deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; as first pointed out by USA Today, is language in the Citi Field lease agreement between the Mets and New York City that protects the Mets from being taken over by a &#8220;prohibited person.&#8221; Such a person, as per Section 17.01(d)(ii) in the agreement (which was obtained by The Post), is &#8220;[a]ny Person that has been convicted in a criminal proceeding for a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude or that is an organized crime figure,&#8221; among other similar transgressions or connections.</p>
 
<p>This is standard operating procedure; the Yankees&#8217; lease for Yankee Stadium features identical language.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well-known that Cohen, 64, founded S.A.C. Capital Advisors, and that the fund pled guilty in 2013 to insider trading and paid $1.8 billion in fines. However, that does not make Cohen a felon as he reached a civil deal with SEC that merely barred him from managing outside money for two years. For de Blasio to block Cohen based on &#8220;moral turpitude,&#8221; especially when Major League Baseball officials strongly support the transaction and Mets fans are frothing with excitement over the switch, appears to be a major stretch. Multiple baseball sources expressed confidence that this would prove nothing more than a formality.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mayor has an obligation to the people of New York City to closely examine new leases on culturally important and incredibly valuable city-owned land,&#8221; said de Blasio&#8217;s press secretary, Bill Neidhardt.</p>
<p>MLB&#8217;s eight-person Ownership Committee recently endorsed Cohen&#8217;s bid, which now moves to the eight-person Executive Council, where it&#8217;s expected to pass, and finally a full vote among all 30 owners. With the Wilpons a definite yes, the Mets will need 22 of the 29 remaining owners to vote in favor of the sale. That seminal vote could take place within a week of the completion of the World Series, which held its Game 2 Wednesday in Arlington, Texas.</p>

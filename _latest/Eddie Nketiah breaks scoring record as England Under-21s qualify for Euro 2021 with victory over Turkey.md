England U21s 2 Turkey U21s 1

Eddie Nketiah secured his place in the England record books as Aidy Boothroyd’s Under-21s booked their spot at the European Championships next year.

Nketiah, the Arsenal forward, has become the all-time leading scorer at this level with 14 goals, breaking a record previously held by Alan Shearer and Francis Jeffers, after producing a neat finish four minutes after missing a penalty.

Nketiah has achieved the accolade in just 12 games and his 88th-minute strike ensures Boothroyd will compete in Hungary and Slovenia at Euro 2021.

Boothroyd has won seven of his eight matches in Group 3 but this was a nervy display for long periods, coming less than a week after their 3-3 draw against minnows Andorra.

Huseyin Turkmen’s own goal had given England an early lead yet they needed Aaron Ramsdale to produce an outstanding performance, with the Sheffield United goalkeeper saving a penalty early in the second half and repelling an attack-minded Turkey team almost on his own.

It was still an evening that Nketiah, 21, will never forget. “It is amazing to get the record and to be alongside those names and players it is a dream come true,” he said.

“We want to be a lot better than we were today and we have been in other games. I think we will come back stronger next time, build on this and take it into the Euros.”

Boothroyd must have thought England were in for a comfortable evening at Molineux, after his team took a deserved lead after 17 minutes, albeit in fortuitous circumstances.

Ryan Sessegnon advanced into the area from the left and his cross took a huge deflection off Turkey defender Turkmen’s thigh to leave Altay Bayindir with no chance.

Turkey did respond and England required Ramsdale late in the first half, with the 22 year-old diving to his left to save from Ahmet Canbaz.

Ramsdale was involved in a hugely controversial moment in the 53rd minute, when he was adjudged to have fouled Halil Dervisoglu in the area by French referee Willy Delajod.

Replays suggested Dervisoglu had taken a clear dive, so England will have felt justice was served when Ramsdale saved the forward’s poor penalty.

England remained unconvincing and Nketiah missed a spot-kick in the 84th minute, striking a post after James Justin was brought down in the area, but he eventually made history by dinking the ball over Bayindir towards the end.

Dervisoglu did grab a consolation for Turkey in added time but England have qualified.

Boothroyd said: “Eddie is a huge talent and on the pitch he takes no prisoners, surpassing Alan’s record is a big achievement.

"I'm really pleased we've got through but we've got to be better than that."

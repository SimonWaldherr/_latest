Musical comic Jon Courtenay has become the first ever Golden Buzzer act to win Britain's Got Talent.

Ant & Dec announced that he had won the 2020 series on Saturday night, leaving the family man, 46, declaring 'please don't ask me to speak!' when questioned on how he was feeling.

Jon beat runners up Sign Along With Us and Steve Royale to the win, saying afterwards: 'I've tried not to think about it because I'm really bad at hiding disappointment.

Champ! Musical comic Jon Courtenay has become the first ever Golden Buzzer act to win Britain's Got Talent

'A couple of mornings I've woken up - and actually this morning, for the first time - this sounds really dramatic - but I woke up and had an idea for a song for the Royal Variety Performance. I wrote it down and I tried not to think about it as a sign...' he said, referencing the prize of performing at the prestigious event.

He went on: 'Just amazing, I can't believe it. Listen, thank you. You don't know how much this means. You have changed my life, my family's life. My mum, I can't imagine how you're coping right now. I hope you're still alive!'

He added: 'Thank you, this has changed my life, my family's life. My mum - I can't imagine how you're coping right now, I hope you're still alive!'

Jon has not only bagged himself a slot at the coveted Royal Variety Performance but will also receive a whopping £250,000.

Golden gal: Amanda Holden looked sensational as she made her demure entrance for the 2020 final - after Ofcom received over 200 complaints about a previous racy number worn on the show

Controversy! Amanda's plunging racy blue gown, worn earlier this series, sparked 235 Ofcom complaints (pictured)

Perfection: Amanda didn't seem fazed by the prior uproar as she stepped out in the sparkling ensemble

Golden glow: She wore her dark blonde locks in a ponytail and added heels to the look, her make-up flawless in matching tones to the rest of her ensemble

Congrats! Ant & Dec announced that he had won the 2020 series on Saturday night, leaving the family man, 46, declaring 'please don't ask me to speak!'

He was in fact that final act to perform on the show, singing a humourous-yet-poignant song reflecting on the year's events.

This left judge Alesha Dixon in tears, commenting afterwards that it was a 'perfect' way to sum up a year that everyone has found difficult.

Elsewhere, Alesha's fellow judge Amanda Holden looked sensational as she made her demure entrance for the 2020 final - after Ofcom received over 200 complaints about a previous racy number worn on the show.

Stepping out alongside fellow judges Alesha, Ashley Banjo and David Walliams, Amanda, 49, rocked a sparkling rose gold, semi-sheer number, with a slanted shoulder and a slight split at the leg.

She wore her dark blonde locks in a ponytail and added heels to the look, her make-up flawless in matching tones to the rest of her ensemble.

WINNER! Jon proudly posed for a picture after he was crowned the winner of the 2020 series

Proud! The four judges posed for a socially-distanced snap with the 2020 winner

Social distancing: When questioned on how he was feeling, Jon said - 'I've tried not to think about it because I'm really bad at hiding disappointment'

Can't believe this! 'Just amazing, I can't believe it. Listen, thank you. You don't know how much this means. You have changed my life, my family's life. My mum, I can't imagine how you're coping right now. I hope you're still alive!' he said

Final three: Jon beat runners up Steve Royale and Sign Along With Us to the win

Amanda's outfit from two weeks ago was a plunging navy gown with a daring thigh-high split and a built in underwire on the bust which sparked another flurry of complaints.

Further complaints came the week after with her next dress choice, and led viewers to question whether she had suffered a wardrobe malfunction on the show.

Amanda laughed off the drama as she spoke exclusively to MailOnline, saying: 'I can see what people think, it had a like an underwire, you know when you have an underwire bikini or bra, the end of it it's like an upside down U isn't it. The end of it dug in. I was more insulted that people thought I had either huge saucepan nipples or nipples over my cleavage.'

BGT 2020 came to a close having battled through a year that has seen many shows, such as The X Factor and Love Island, sit production out entirely.

The series was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the spring, when it usually broadcasts auditions and the live finals prior to the summer. But ITV made sure it returned this autumn to complete the contest.

The contestants each took to the stage to perform one final time, with young magician Aidan McCann roping judge David in to a trick in which he guessed which word he'd written down.

Next up was Aaron and Jasmine, a dance duo, who put on an energy-fuelled spectacle.

This was followed my magic man Damien O'Brien, who asked Amanda to take part in a trick which saw her look him up on Instagram.

This left the judge a tad red-faced as she realised that he followed her account on the social media page, but that she didn't follow him back.

Props: As Amanda's phone was revealed to be wrapped up inside, it went flying off her desk and across the studio floor in a slightly awkward moment

'Oh! I'll just quickly follow you back there!' she said, promptly hitting the 'Follow' tab on her screen.

She then had to hand her phone over the Damien, who made it disappear, then reappear wrapped in a rope.

Holding onto the rope, Damien walked back onto the stage, unravelling it as he went.

Eventual third place: Next up was magician Steve Royle who performed a zany routine

But Amanda brushed this off, too gobsmacked about how Damien had done the trick.

Next up was eventual third-place Steve Royle who performed a zany routine, followed by Magical Bones, another magician.

Sign Along With Us were next to take to the stage to wow the judges and viewers. Father and son James and Dylan Piper were up next. They performed from a fake set, pretending to be at home before turning up in the studio.

Stand-up comedian Nabil Abdulrashid left the judges impressed as he addressed the multitude of complaints BGT has been subject to this series, including Amanda's dress and Diversity's Black Lives Matter dance.

Yet viewers were left divided over the routine with some branding the performance 'too political' for a family show while others praised him for 'pushing boundaries'.

After the routine, Ashley said: 'I know what it's like to get a few complaints! There are two ways you can react, you can bend to pressure or you can be unapologetically yourself.

'And it's pretty obvious to me which one you chose! It's not even about being Black it's about being unapologetically you.'

The judges (including Ashley sitting in for an injured Simon Cowell) have been sitting at a social distance for the finals, after the contestants patiently waited all summer long to complete the competition.

The audience was replaced with a virtual audience, allowing the arena atmosphere to be prominent in line with the strict COVID-19 rules that continue to be in place.

Viewers were also wowed by performances from the brilliant combined companies of Les Misérables – The Staged Concert, The Phantom Of The Opera and Mary Poppins.

Sign Along With Us - a group started by 19-year-old Jade, whose little brother Christian suffers with cerebral palsy - came in second place, with Jade clearly overwhelmed by it all.

She said: 'Oh my god! So proud of every single one of the group. I can't believe it. Well done [Jon] - a deserving winner!'

A new Donald Trump campaign advertisement featuring an image of Jackie Robinson has drawn the condemnation of the baseball legend's daughter, Sharon.

"Jackie Robinson's family strongly objects to the use of Jackie Robinson's image," Robinson tweeted Thursday. "The Trump campaign is in opposition to all that Jackie Robinson stood for and believed in. We're insulted and demand that his image be removed!"

Robinson broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. In 1997, his No. 42 was retired throughout baseball and the league celebrates Jackie Robinson Day on April 15 every season.

Sharon, an author and educator, sits on the board of the Jackie Robinson Foundation and along with her mother, Rachel, has been integral in carrying out Jackie's legacy through the years.

The Trump advertisement, called "Say What You Will About America," also uses an image of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

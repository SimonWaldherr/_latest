<div><p>There are certain numbers that, over time, have become so linked to a specific subject or message that they carry their meaning far beyond their bare digits. They transcend maths and statistics, so heavy with connotation that what they refer to doesn&#8217;t need to be spelled out in words. It is there in your head immediately. You understand as quickly as you hear.</p>
<p>To pick a random selection, 999 and 911 are two of them; 666 might be another, if you believe in that sort of thing. But has there ever been a number that can paint pictures in your mind quite as readily as 747? As soon as you read that figure, you can see it. In many ways, this article could stop right here. You do not need the paragraphs below for your brain to flick through a few stored mental images &#8211; great wings silhouetted against the sky; that enormous fuselage, so large that the part of your psyche which deals in fear and nervousness doubts that it could ever take off; that distinctive &#8220;bumpy&#8221; nose. It is all there without any requirement for further musing. An aviation behemoth. A very big bird.</p>
<p>Except, of course, that, as of today, it is there a little less. This morning witnessed the final two departures from Heathrow of British Airways flights involving the Boeing 747. It was, in truth, an inauspicious pair of farewells, these two jumbo jets lumbering out of the misty west-London gloom just after 9am, and thundering upwards in the direction of, respectively, Cotswold Airport in Gloucestershire, and an airfield near Cardiff. Not quite the New York or Los Angeles of years past. If all farewells should be sudden when forever, as Lord Byron once wrote, then this was very much it. Thankyou, and goodnight.&#160;</p>

<p>Technically, this is not quite forever. Not yet. For now, British Airways still has a small number of the aircraft at an engineering facility in Wales &#8211; and the Boeing 747 is still in operation, just, for other airlines (of the major players, Air China still has 10, Lufthansa 27 and KLM four). But the 747 is also increasingly yesterday&#8217;s woman; a relic of the 20th century clinging on in the 21st. And in terms of scheduled flights for Britain&#8217;s flag-carrier from Britain&#8217;s main air hub, this was a full-stop for the &#8220;Queen of the Skies&#8221;. Jumbos G-CIVB and G-CIVY took with them half a century of aviation and travel history.</p>
<p>If you are so inclined, you can go onto Twitter and Instagram today, where the hashtag #BA747Farewell is vaguely visible amid all the froth and clamour about Covid-19 and the state of politics. And, if you want, you can spend a few minutes there, discussing the aircraft&#8217;s demise. But then, the Boeing 747 feels an awkward fit with the up-to-the-very-second modernity of social media in 2020. It belongs to a different time, and another era.</p>

<p>Indeed &#8211; this is the reason it is fading from view. True, Covid-19 has hastened its death &#8211; British Airways had planned to keep it in service a little further into this new decade, only for the slump in demand for air travel, brought on by the pandemic, to mean that the funeral cortege has had to go to the airport sooner than had been anticipated. But the plane&#8217;s terminal symptoms were already apparent, even without the rows of empty seats which define the experience of flying in this strange year. Too big, too noisy, too expensive to run (if not at full capacity), too greedy of fuel consumption, and too much of a polluter at a time when the world needs to think green(er), the 747 had already had its day, even before a deadly virus started stalking the planet. British Airways is certainly not the first airline to consign the aircraft to the museum and the scrap-yard. American Airlines sold off the last of its jumbo jets in the mid-Nineties. Delta initially did so at a similar stage, only to inherit another set following its merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008 &#8211; though these, too, were retired at the end of 2017. Virgin Atlantic kept it in work for a while longer &#8211; but called time on it with immediate effect in May, as Covid-19 bit.</p>

<p>Better, though, not to view the 747 through the lens of its inevitable decline&#160;&#8211; but as a mould-breaker which changed the way the world flew. For this is exactly what it was; a revolution with engines that helped to make air travel accessible for all. It was born, as so much was, amid the optimism and the strong economic currents of the early- and mid-Sixties, driven into being by the determination of US carrier Pan Am to own a plane that it could fly further, for longer, with more people aboard, than anything that had come before. It required a change of thinking, as well as design. When Pan Am put its request to Boeing, the Seattle manufacturer did not have a plant large enough for the assembly of an airliner with such an extended wingspan (196ft/59.6m on the original 747-100 incarnation of the aircraft). But Boeing adapted, and so did the aviation world. Its first scheduled service took off on January 22 1970&#160;&#8211; a Pan Am connection from New York to London. And although success would not be immediate&#160;&#8211; the recession of 1969-70 meant Boeing only sold two of the planes between September 1970 and the end of 1971&#160;&#8211; the 747 would become a fixture in the heavens, able to carry more than 350 passengers in three travel classes. Boeing would produce five more iterations of its baby (culminating in the 747-8, which came into operation as a commercial passenger aircraft in March 2011). It would zoom back and forth across the globe, with first-class cabins and piano bars a symbol of its ability to deal in high luxury, and its flip-up nose, opening onto its cargo deck (the reason for that famous hump), a sign that it was also a sturdy workhorse.</p>

<p>Of course, it is not an aircraft whose story would be all sunset promotional photos and the clink of champagne glasses in the posh seats. It had its hours of darkness. That inaugural flight, from JFK to Heathrow, should have departed a day earlier, on January 21 1970&#160;&#8211; but had to be delayed because the engines on the designated aircraft were overheating. A replacement, Clipper Victor, was drafted in. The substitute performed its key mission ably, but would find a far more tragic slot in history as one of the two 747s that collided, in heavy fog, on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport in Tenerife on March 27 1977&#160;&#8211; the deadliest accident in aviation history. Clipper Victor was still a Pan Am plane in its final seconds. So was Clipper Maid Of The Seas, the 747-121 downed by a bomb over Lockerbie on December 21 1988. Pan Am, which went bankrupt in 1991, would never wholly recover from the image of that huge cockpit, lying decapitated upon Scottish soil.</p>
<p>Still, it is not for such disasters that the 747 will primarily be remembered. For 50 years (and perhaps a couple more), it was a stallion above the clouds, a Pegasus that everyone could ride. It will disappear into yesterday with a few tears, but a lot of happy memories.</p>

These girls sure know how to party in luxurious style, as was abundantly clear over the weekend.

And Kylie Jenner shared her appreciation for her friend Cardi B by gifting her with a much-coveted Birkin bag for her 28th birthday, as seen on the WAP hitmaker's Instagram Story on Sunday.

Birkin bags, from French high fashion designer Hermes, are considered the epitome of luxury in a handbag, with retail prices ranging anywhere from a paltry $9.85K all the way up to $500K at auction.

Cardi's present was a lovely shade of teal blue, akin to the blue of a Tiffany's gift box.

The Bodak Yellow star filmed the unboxing of the gift, clearly overjoyed and thanking Kylie, 23, profusely.

'Oh, powder blue! I know I got a bathing suit to match this sh*t,' she was heard enthusing.

Her longer-than-long glittery manicure was visible in the clip as she held up the Birkin by the tote handle, spinning it around for the camera.

Kylie documented her wow-effect outfit worn to the shindig on her Instagram – a super-sexy mesh peach minidress which let her busty figure be on full display.

The soiree was also attended by Cardi's other WAP collaborator, Megan Thee Stallion, who wowed herself in a sheer all-black bodysuit number.

Jenner, however, did not spend all night at Cardi's fete – she was partying with her friends and the group continued their own festivities aboard her private jet.

Halloween is approaching. It won't be the same amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

In Nevada, Gov. Steve Sisolak canceled the annual trick-or-treating event at his residence in an effort to protect visitors and his staff. In California, Beverly Hills city officials banned trick-or-treating and car-to-car trunk-or-treating in the city. That announcement comes a month after Los Angeles officials reversed a trick-or-treating ban, now only recommending against it.

Across the world, India reported its lowest daily increase of COVID-19 deaths in nearly three months on Thursday. There were 680 reported deaths in the past 24 hours, officials said. Last month, the daily death toll count was over 1,000.

Some significant developments:

Alabama coach Nick Saban and athletics director Greg Byrne tested positive for COVID-19.

Spain is the first European Union nation to reach 900,000 cases of the coronavirus.

First lady Melania Trump revealed that her 14-year-old son Barron Trump had COVID-19 but has now tested negative.

üìà Today's numbers: The U.S. has reported more than 7.9 million cases and 216,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data. There have been more than 38.5 million confirmed cases around the world and 1 million deaths.

White House's 'herd immunity' strategy won't stop COVID, scientists say

The idea that the public can infect its way out of the COVID-19 pandemic is "a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence," 80 researchers said in a letter published in the Lancet.

They strongly denounced the idea, advocated by the White House, of achieving "herd immunity" against the virus that causes the disease by letting healthy people with a low risk of serious illness get infected.

‚ÄúThe most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk," the declaration says.

A community is considered to have herd immunity when enough people have built up protection against a pathogen, either through natural infection or a vaccine. No one knows exactly how many people need to be protected to stop COVID-19 from spreading, but estimates range from 50-70% of the population. Current estimates put that percentage based on those who've been infected in the U.S. at about 10%.

Baby boomers still confident on retirement despite pandemic

Despite the uncertainty spawned by the coronavirus pandemic, baby boomers are confident they will have a successful retirement and their lifestyle will be everything they planned.

That's according to a Charles Schwab survey, which found that 82% of boomers believe their savings will get them ‚Äúall the way‚Äù or ‚Äúmost of the way‚Äù to living out their dreams in retirement.

The age group, aged 55 to 75, also believe their lifestyle will compare better than the generations before and after them.

Over 84% of boomers anticipate their quality of life in retirement will be better than that of their parents. More than 80% of boomers also believe their retirement will be better than their children's.

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak cancels trick-or-treating at governor's mansion

Trick-or-treating at the Nevada governor‚Äôs mansion has been canceled this year due to the pandemic, and state health officials are advising people marking Halloween and D√≠a de los Muertos to avoid large gatherings.

Gov. Steve Sisolak announced that his official residence in Carson City will be decorated but the annual festivities will not take place to help keep staff and visitors safe.

‚ÄúParticipating in virtual activities is the safest option,‚Äù according to recommendations from Nevada's COVID-19 response office.

Anti-mask parents raise $11,000 for lawsuit against Florida schools

Parents in Florida have raised more than $11,000 to hire an attorney as the group‚Äôs organizers prepare to sue the Sarasota County School Board‚Äôs mask policy.

‚ÄúWe are taking action to have the mask mandate decision reversed immediately for the physical, emotional and social well-being of our children. The decisions made by the board are not in the best interest of the people they serve,‚Äù the petition accompanying the fundraiser states.

The petition sponsors did not respond to a request for further comment on Tuesday, and their legal strategy is not clear, although a post from an organizer said a lawsuit should be filed by Friday.

The School Board‚Äôs current policy generally requires all students and staff to wear masks throughout the school day, with a handful of exceptions. Students are not required to wear the face coverings while exercising or eating, and as long as they are socially distanced from their classmates, they may take brief mask breaks during class.

Survey: Americans ready to try nomadic van life due to coronavirus

According to a new survey from Move.org, Americans are considering getting rid of their homes in favor of van life and a cheaper, more nomadic experience.

The moving company review site asked hundreds of respondents about how they felt about van life and found that 52% of Americans are now more open to van life, in which practitioners live full or part time in modified vehicles with basic amenities like beds, storage, toilets, cookstoves and Wi-Fi, allowing occupants to work anywhere.

So who are these would-be nomads?

"One interesting correlation from our data is that most of those who would consider van life because of COVID-19 were millennials," the group said in a post on its website. "To break it down further, 31% of those considering van life because of the pandemic were in the 35-44 age range and 29% were in the 25‚Äì34 age range. One thing is clear: van life definitely isn‚Äôt as fringe as it used to be, especially among younger adults."

Alabama coach Saban tests positive

Alabama coach Nick Saban has tested positive for COVID-19 and is currently in isolation at home, the university announced Wednesday.

Saban, 68, is not experiencing any symptoms of the coronavirus, he said in a statement. The announcement comes just three days before No. 2 Alabama is set to meet No. 3 Georgia at home in one of the biggest games of the regular season.

"I found out earlier this afternoon that I had tested positive for COVID-19. I immediately left work and isolated at home," Saban said, adding that Alabama offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian "will oversee preparations at the complex while I work from home."

Melania Trump says their son, Barron Trump, tested positive for COVID-19

Melania Trump said that after an initial negative test, 14-year-old Barron Trump tested positive for COVID-19.

"It was two weeks ago when I received the diagnosis that so many Americans across our country and the world had already received ‚Äì I tested positive for COVID-19," the first lady said in a statement. "To make matters worse, my husband, and our nation‚Äôs Commander-in-Chief, received the same news."

She continued: "Naturally my mind went immediately to our son. To our great relief he tested negative, but again, as so many parents have thought over the past several months, I couldn‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúwhat about tomorrow or the next day?‚Äù

"My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms. In one way I was glad the three of us went through this at the same time so we could take care of one another and spend time together. He has since tested negative."

Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's chief of staff and spokeswoman, told USA TODAY on Oct. 2 that Barron "has tested negative, and all precautions are being taken to ensure he‚Äôs kept safe and healthy."

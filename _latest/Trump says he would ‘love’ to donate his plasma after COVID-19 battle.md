WASHINGTON — President Trump said Friday that he will donate convalescent plasma to other Americans battling the coronavirus after he developed antibodies to COVID-19.

“I will. Nobody’s asked me that question, actually, but I will. If that’s, if they want me to do it, I’d love to do it,” the commander-in-chief said during a “medical examination” on Fox News on Friday evening.

The president made the remarks during a “televisit” of sorts with Dr. Mark Siegel, a Fox News contributor, on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” — his first on-camera interview since being hospitalized with the virus.

On Thursday evening, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said the president had completed his treatment and cleared him to return to his public duties.

The commander-in-chief, eager to get back on the campaign trail, has since announced a “law and order” speech in front of a crowd on the White House South Lawn and a comeback rally in Florida.

In August, the White House announced an emergency authorization for convalescent plasma to be used as a coronavirus treatment which Trump dubbed a “truly historic” declaration.

The designation by the Food and Drug Administration will make it easier for COVID-19 patients to obtain the treatment which utilizes the antibody-rich blood plasma of those who have recovered from the virus.

<div><p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update</strong>: The spacecraft has touched down and sample collection was successful! OSIRIS-REx is now moving away from the asteroid with the goods and will begin its homeward journey as soon as it&#8217;s clear.</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s OSIRIS-REx probe is about to touch down on an asteroid for a smash-and-grab mission, and you can follow its progress live &#8212; kind of. The craft is scheduled to perform its collection operation this afternoon, and we&#8217;ll know within minutes if all went according to plan.</p>
<p>OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security &#8212; Regolith Explorer, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/heres-why-nasa-is-launching-an-asteroid-sample-return-mission-for-the-first-time/">launched in September of 2016</a> and since arriving at its destination, the asteroid Bennu, has performed a delicate dance with it,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/nasas-best-yet-photo-of-asteroid-bennu-nails-the-dramatic-lighting/"> entering an orbit so close it set records</a>.</p>
<p>Today is the culmination of the team&#8217;s efforts, the actual &#8220;touch and go&#8221; or TAG maneuver that will see the probe briefly land on the asteroid&#8217;s surface and suck up some of its precious space dust. Just a few seconds later, once sampling is confirmed, the craft will jet upward again to escape Bennu and begin its journey home.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>While there won&#8217;t be live HD video of the whole attempt, NASA will be providing both a live animation of the process, informed by OSIRIS-REx&#8217;s telemetry, and presumably any good images that are captured as it descends.</p>
<p>We know for certain this is both possible and very cool because Japan&#8217;s Hayabusa-2 asteroid mission did something very similar last year, but with the added complexity (and coolness) of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/21/japans-hayabusa-2-mission-lands-on-the-surface-of-a-distant-asteroid/">firing a projectile into the surface</a> to stir things up and get a more diverse sample.</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s coverage starts at 2 p.m. PDT, and the touchdown event is planned to take place an hour or so later, at 3:12, if all goes according to plan. You can watch the whole thing take place in simulation<a href="https://www.asteroidmission.org/livestream/"> at this Twitch feed</a>, which will be updated live, but NASA TV will also have live coverage and commentary on its YouTube channel. Images may come back from the descent and collection, but they&#8217;ll be delayed (it&#8217;s hard sending lots of data over a million-mile gap) so if you want the latest, listen closely to the NASA feeds.</p>

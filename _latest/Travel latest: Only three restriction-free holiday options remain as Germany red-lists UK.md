<p>The German embassy said visitors can present a negative Covid-19 test result that is no older than 48 hours, or get a test done on arrival. Those who are tested on arrival must go into self-isolation until they receive their result.</p>

<p>This brings the number of destinations with zero travel restrictions for UK holidaymakers down to three: Sweden, Greece (except Mykonos) and Gibraltar. There are an additional 16 countries that British people can feasibly visit, but must present a negative test result, or take a test on arrival to avoid quarantine.</p>

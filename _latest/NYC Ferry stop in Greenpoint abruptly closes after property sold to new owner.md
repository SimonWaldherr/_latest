  The NYC Ferry stop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn was abruptly shuttered over the weekend — after the land was sold to a new owner, the service said.“Due to temporary restrictions to the Greenpoint pier, ferry service to and from the Greenpoint landing will be suspended until further notice,” operator Hornblower said in an early Sunday morning tweet announcing the closure.“Unfortunately access has been restricted by the new owner of the pier,” the company said in a follow-up tweet hours later.The company on Monday blamed Hornblower for the closure, and said it expected the issue to be resolved soon.“We’ve had to temporarily restrict ferry access to the India Street Pier while we await the ferry service operator, Hornblower, to furnish appropriate insurance documentation, expected today,” a Lendlease rep said.

<div><p>The NYC Ferry stop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn was abruptly shuttered over the weekend &#8212; after the land was sold to a new owner, the service said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to temporary restrictions to the Greenpoint pier, ferry service to and from the Greenpoint landing will be suspended until further notice,&#8221; operator Hornblower said in an <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCferry/status/1317891794256920582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early Sunday morning tweet</a> announcing the closure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately access has been restricted by the new owner of the pier,&#8221; the company said in a follow-up tweet hours later.</p>
<p>Real estate firm Lendlease purchased the entire block where the pier is located last week for $110.8 million, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2020/10/09/lendlease-pays-over-100m-for-large-greenpoint-dev-site/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Real Deal reported</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The company on Monday blamed Hornblower for the closure, and said it expected the issue to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to temporarily restrict ferry access to the India Street Pier while we await the ferry service operator, Hornblower, to furnish appropriate insurance documentation, expected today,&#8221; a Lendlease rep said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand the inconvenience the ferry service disruption has caused and are working diligently to help resolve the situation as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>But local officials were furious about the unexpected shutter &#8212; which left commuters stranded Monday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am livid about this. This property and pier has a long history (including the gangway falling into the East River in 2014),&#8221; local city councilman Stephen Levin <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenLevin33/status/1318033493805457410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never heard that the city&#8230; didn&#8217;t have ongoing legal access to the pier.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ElizabAdams/status/1318171382803501057" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Video posted to Twitter</a> by Levin staffer Elizabeth Adams, who is also running to succeed him, shows a ferry boat bypassing the dock &#8212; and a man on the boat waving off would-be riders on the shore.</p>
<p>Asked about the closure at a press conference Monday, Mayor de Blasio said the city is &#8220;hopeful&#8221; access can be restored &#8220;today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to settle it very quickly and get that ferry stop back into service hopefully as early as today,&#8221; Hizzoner said.</p>

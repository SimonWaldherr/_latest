Czech schools will shut and go online from tonight and restaurants and bars will close too as daily cases reach 4,310. Hospital admissions have more than doubled since the start of October.

An Austrian report into the Iscghl ski resort outbreak that affected more than 6,000 European tourists in March has criticised the local mayor, regional authorities and even Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Ski-ing was allowed to continue three days too long, and when evacuation came it was rushed and disorganised.

Dutch PM Mark Rutte is expected to announce the complete closure of restaurants, hotels and cafes for at least two weeks this evening. Catering industry head Dirk Beijarts says this could be the last straw for some owners. Average daily infections have doubled in a fortnight to more than 6,000.

The French cabinet will this evening consider a possible curfew to bring down the infection rate. In Paris, the head of public hospital group APHP, Martin Hirsch, warned 90% of intensive care beds would be filled by 24 October

Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa has ruled out lifting Madrid's locally disputed state of alarm, even though 14-day infection rates have fallen to 501 cases per 100,000 people. He wants to see the rate below 200, not 500.

A new Italian decree bans school trips and amateur contact sports such as football in the park. Private parties are banned and Italians are strongly urged to limit home visits to six.

<div><p>Admissions for patients with &#8220;nonspecific cardiac chest pain&#8221; &#8211; a&#160; red flag condition which can indicate a heart attack &#8211; fell by 41 per cent, while those for patients with a specific heart attack diagnosis dropped by 27 per cent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those to diagnose or treat gastrointestinal disorders were down by 90 per cent.</p>
<p>Earlier this month NHS chiefs launched a campaign &#8211; Help Us to Help You &#8211; assuring patients that they will not be viewed as a burden if they seek help for non-Covid ailments following concerns about the effects of the the Government&#8217;s advice to &#8220;Protect the NHS&#8221;.</p>
<p>Experts have said poor access for diagnosis and care during the pandemic could see an extra 35,000 deaths from cancer this year.</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/16/relatives-can-soon-see-loved-ones-care-homes-multiple-times/">Care Quality Commission</a> said millions of patients had missed out on GP appointments since lockdown, meaning fewer referrals to hospital for vital checks.</p>
<p>In total there were almost 27 million fewer GP appointments carried out between March and August this year, compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p>Kruti Shrotri, Cancer Research UK policy manager, said: &#8220;These figures provide further evidence of the devastating impact that Covid-19 has had on diagnosing and treating patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;As health services are now having to manage a resurgence of Covid-19 on top of usual winter pressures, it&#8217;s critical that we take forward the lessons learnt so far to ensure cancer patients get the care they need through a second wave of the virus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of patients starting cancer treatment such as chemotherapy and radiology between April and July is 26 per cent lower than the same period last year, with around 31,000 patients missing out, the charity said.</p>
<p>Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation and a consultant cardiologist, said: &#8220;We are sadly seeing the fallout of people not getting cardiovascular care during this pandemic &#8211; with thousands of excess deaths caused by these conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s vital that people can access healthcare as they usually would.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data shows more than 4,400 extra deaths from heart disease and stroke in Britain during the first four months of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Karen Stalbow, from Prostate Cancer UK said that while most localised prostate cancer grows slowly, it was critical that the most urgent cases were not forced to endure further waits.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;Some men simply cannot afford to wait, and as we enter the second wave of the pandemic, it is vital that hospitals can continue to provide treatments for those most at risk of their cancer progressing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Binstead, director of strategy and analytics, at Dr Foster, said some of the figures were &#8220;staggering&#8221; with falls seen &#8220;across the board&#8221; including in almost all emergency activity, other than childbirth.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Overall, the analysis suggests that the long-term effects of the pandemic are likely to be far reaching, with a future spike in demand possible due to missed diagnoses and postponed procedures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cancers may now require a greater level of treatment, or even be untreatable, if they have been left undetected or untreated as a result of the crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>An NHS spokesman said: &#8220;At the height of the first coronavirus&#160;peak and lockdown, some people chose to postpone care, but since then hospital admissions have now rebounded, routine operations have more than doubled and cancer treatments are now taking place at well above usual levels. The NHS message to the public has been quite clear &#8211; do not delay, help us help you by coming forward so you can get the care you need."</p>

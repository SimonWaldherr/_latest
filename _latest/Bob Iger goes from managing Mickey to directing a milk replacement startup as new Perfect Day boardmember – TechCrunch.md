<div><p>Bob Iger goes from managing Mickey to directing a milk replacement startup as new Perfect Day boardmember</p><p id="speakable-summary">Bob Iger, the chairman and former chief executive at<a href="https://www.disney.com/"> Walt Disney</a> is trading his mouse ears for milk substitutes as the new director of massively funded dairy replacement startup <a href="https://www.perfectdayfoods.com/">Perfect Day</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/milk" target="_blank">Milk </a> substitutes are a $1 trillion category and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/perfectday" target="_blank">Perfect Day </a> is angling to be the leader in the market. Iger&#8217;s ascension to a director position at the company just affirms that Perfect Day is a big business in the big business of making milk replacements.</p>
<p>Unlike almond milk or soy milk companies, Perfect Day is angling to be a direct replacement for bovine dairy using a protein cultivated from mushrooms.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>The move comes as Perfect Day ramps up its development of consumer products on its own and through investments in startups like the <a href="https://theurgentcompany.com/">Urgent Company</a>. That&#8217;s the consumer food company Perfect Day backed to commercialize technologies and create more sustainable food brands.</p>
<p>For Iger, the Perfect Day board represents the first new board seat the longtime entertainment powerbroker has taken since he left Apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Innovation and leadership are both key to world changing ideas,&#8221; said Iger, in a statement. &#8220;Perfect Day has established both innovation in its use of technology and novel approach to fighting climate change, <i>and</i>&#160;clear leadership in building a category with a multi-year head start in the industry they&#8217;re helping to build. I&#8217;m thrilled to join at this pivotal moment and support the company&#8217;s swift growth into new categories and markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iger joins Perfect Day&#8217;s co-founders <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ryan-pandya" target="_blank">Ryan Pandya </a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/perumal-gandhi" target="_blank">Perumal Gandhi, </a> and representatives from the company&#8217;s international backers and lead investors, Aftab Mathur, from Temasek Holdings, and Patrick Zhang, of Horizons Ventures.</p>
<p>Until yesterday, Perfect Day was the most well-capitalized protein fermentation company focused on dairy in the world. That&#8217;s when <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/impossible-foods" target="_blank">Impossible Foods, </a> the alternative meat manufacturer which has raised $1.5 billion from investors, unveiled that it, too, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/impossible-foods-is-now-developing-a-plant-based-altern-1845425703">was working on a dairy product</a>.</p>
<p>Perfect Day, by contrast, has raised $360 million in total funding to-date.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to have&#160;Bob Iger&#160;join our team, and are confident his tenured operational expertise and visionary leadership style will further help us scale our ambitions,&#8221; said&#160;Ryan Pandya, the chief executive and co-founder of Perfect Day, in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re focused on rapid commercialization in the U.S. and globally. But we know we can&#8217;t do it alone. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited and humbled to have a proven leader like Bob to help us thoughtfully transform our purpose-driven aspirations into tangible and sustainable impact.&#8221;</p>

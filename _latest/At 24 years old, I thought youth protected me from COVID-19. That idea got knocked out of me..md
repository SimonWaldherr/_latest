<div><p class="gnt_ar_by">Ashley Andreou</p><p class="gnt_ar_pb">Opinion contributor</p><p class="teal-video-wrap"></p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">My arm struggled to fasten the deadbolt at the top of my apartment door. Finally maneuvering the door shut, I felt my body lean up against it for support. I crawled into bed. Maybe this pressure in my head and disorienting funk would lift by the morning. &#8220;I am young. I am healthy,&#8221; I repeated to myself.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Twenty minutes later, I awoke drenched in sweat. I threw my duvet off. Unable to lift myself, I curled into the fetal position while shivers racked my body. My joints seized and my rigid body shook in the damp halo that surrounded me on my dark sheets. I was too frail to overpower the elephant in the room.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I have coronavirus,&#8221; I said over and over, shaking my head.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Doubled over, I tried to get tap water. Bracing myself with my hands on my knees, I finally made it. When I collapsed back into bed, my body and head throbbed. As an adult, there are very few moments in your life when you truly question if you can take care of yourself. I ordered NyQuil, strawberry Pedialyte, and a thermometer on a delivery app and pulled my laptop onto my bed. I just have to get through each day, I thought.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Days of symptoms</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This happened in September 2020, and for the next 48 hours, I could not discern whether I was awake, sleeping, or Facetiming my mom. My temperature fluctuated between 100 and 104 degrees, and my delirium with it. Flattened on my bed, I Googled, &#8220;Can a fever kill you?&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t discern if the tightness in my chest and palpating heart were from anxiety or a respiratory demise. I was convinced my skin was peeling off due to the prickling sensations under my skin, which acetaminophen could not suppress.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Then it started, the burning in my nose. I thought I smelt gasoline, mint, blueberry, pine trees &#8212; then, after a couple of hours, it went blank. No signal. This numbness enraged me. I didn&#8217;t have enough energy to throw anything, so I flailed and kicked a pillow off my bed.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">COVID long-haulers:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/09/28/long-covid-post-coronavirus-syndrome-recovery-symptoms-column/3552751001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">I caught coronavirus in March. I still haven't fully recovered.</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After two days, I could get out of bed. In fact, I felt invigorated. I must be regaining my health, I thought. Yes, this must be what medical experts mean when they say young people experience a bad flu&#160;and then they&#8217;re over it. I was only 24 years old. I gave myself a warm mental embrace, congratulating myself for weathering the storm. Finally having enough energy to get tested, I ventured out. But upon arriving home, the lonely aimlessness of self-isolation seeped in and I wandered back to bed and onto Netflix.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A day later, I woke tangled in wet blankets. The virus was back with a second, spiteful vengeance and, this time, it had settled into my lungs. My breathing was labored and shallow. The only lucid moment I had was receiving my positive COVID-19 results and feverishly forwarding them to all my medical school deans. I tried to shower and almost fainted. Despite not being religious, prayer was the only place my mind went when I laid lifeless on my bed for hours. I prayed hard and fast, &#8220;please, make this end.&#8221; Something didn&#8217;t seem right, even Google agreed. I called my dad, a physician, and told him I was heading to the hospital.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">First, second, third opinion</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Emergency Department physician assured me that my oxygen was perfectly saturated, the fevers were completely normal, and that I was going to be fine. I stared at the scuffs on my sneakers &#8212; I didn&#8217;t&#160;feel&#160;fine.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When I arrived home, I was drained. My dad called and said an infectious disease doctor at his Canadian hospital had offered to help me and would call today.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When my phone rang, the doctor's cheery voice boomed over the phone. He reassured me that he would oversee my care and do everything in his power to get me through this. He said he was worried about viral pneumonia and that I needed a chest X-ray and bloodwork done as soon as possible. After hanging up, my phone buzzed again.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Ashley Andreou in Los Angeles, California, in 2017."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A doctor from Georgetown Student Health was on the phone. She saw my discharge papers from the hospital and also recommended a chest X-ray immediately, explaining that the virus presents differently in young people with excess lung capacity. Within minutes, she scheduled me to go to the Radiology Department for an X-ray that evening. Winded from talking, I ran to the bathroom and hacked up orange and red phlegm.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When the Georgetown Student Health doctor sent me the X-ray results, she said the results were&#160;consistent with pneumonia. The images that followed showed every recess of my lungs lit up like lightning. There was almost no tissue that the virus hadn&#8217;t worked its way into. I gasped for air, as sobs heaved through me.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Opinion video:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/opinion/2020/10/09/history-president-donald-trumps-comments-covid-19/5920362002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">COVID-19 pandemic in President Trump's words</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Shaking, I forwarded the pictures to my father's colleague. He jumped on the phone to reassure&#160;me that young and strong people like me do remarkably well with viral pneumonia. Without dismissing my fears, he calmly explained that we were going to proactively monitor my oxygen all weekend with my <a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/aug/can-an-oximeter-help-detect-covid-19-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">pulse oximeter</a>, a small device that measures oxygen levels. If my saturation continually trended downwards below 94%, I might be going into <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ards/symptoms-causes/syc-20355576" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">acute respiratory distress syndrome</a> (ARDS). He assured me that ARDS was not a big worry for him and that, if it did happen, I would go to a hospital, be put on <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">dexamethasone</a>, a steroid, and likely be just fine then too.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how much your help means to me,&#8221; I managed and quickly hung up before tears spilled out again.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Coming out of the COVID fog</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">I used to read the headlines about young, hospitalized individuals and think that the "alarmist" coverage&#160;was simply a tactic to control the throngs of college-aged partiers, who seemed unfazed by the idea of a pandemic. Despite my background in public health, I considered severe COVID-19 sickness for a young, healthy person as more of an empty threat than a reality.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">We&#8217;ve been in this pandemic for half a year. It&#8217;s natural for our hand-scrubbing, mask-wearing, sanitizer-dosing vigilance to slip and for us to cling to the rosiest of outlooks &#8212; that we&#8217;re over the worst of it. Unfortunately, with cold weather forcing us indoors, flu season coming, and the timeline for a safe, evidence-based vaccine&#160;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/09/09/trump-administration-takes-action-to-expand-access-to-covid-19-vaccines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">extending into 2021</a>, we still have much of the pandemic ahead of us.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">COVID-19 isn't the only threat:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/09/29/coronavirus-opioid-crisis-deaths-despair-covid-19-column/3560245001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">I lost my son to an opioid overdose. COVID-19 will only bring more deaths of despair.</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">To this day, I struggle with balancing my medical school studies with some of the long-term side effects of the virus, such as vertigo, shortness of breath, and brain fog.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">I am almost back to my pre-COVID self,&#160;but, not unlike President Donald&#160;Trump, I was extremely privileged to have access to the knowledge and medical resources that I did during my illness. If people don&#8217;t have access to health care providers or mental health professionals, know how to strengthen their immune system, or understand the importance of monitoring their oxygen and temperature at home, their experience could be even more anxiety-inducing and medically dire.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Perhaps news outlets, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public health resources should tailor more of their advice to young individuals, who will likely have to monitor themselves at home.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Each day, we make several decisions about the risk level we want to assume with COVID-19 &#8212; where to go, who to see, and what hygiene to practice. When making these decisions, I hope other young people hear my experience and calculate the potential of experiencing the worst days of their life on the off-chance that they do contract COVID-19. And, if you do contract the disease, I hope you know you&#8217;re not alone and there are countless health care professionals out there who will care for you like family.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Ashley Andreou is a student at&#160;Georgetown University School of Medicine.

Council leaders in the North East of England are planning to oppose additional restrictions in the region, including a proposal to close bars and restaurants.

A meeting between council bosses and a senior Whitehall official had been scheduled for this afternoon, but has been delayed. Boris Johnson is thought to be hammering out the detail of his latest plan - which will incorporate a three-tired approach - throughout today.

Gateshead Council leader Martin Gannon said his counterparts at Northumberland, Newcastle, South and North Tyneside, Sunderland and County Durham had "agreed a line".

He told the PA news agency: "We do not want further restrictions. Despite three sets of regulations in 10 days and the ensuing mixed massaging, there is evidence that, excluding higher education students - which is a national problem - new cases are beginning to plateau.

"We need more time, clearer messaging and greater support from Government."

Asked if that meant they opposed plans to shutter pubs and restaurants in the North, Mr Gannon said: "Further restrictions will have an enormous impact on our economy and the 50-60,000 workers employed in hospitality.

"We believe the current measures can work without further damage by closing hospitality. If Government ignore us we will call for a substantial financial package to sustain the businesses and workers."

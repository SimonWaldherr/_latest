  The graphics, presented at today's Number 10 press briefing, reveal that parts of the North West, North East and Midlands are experiencing the fastest growth in the virus.Lincolnshire has seen a particularly sharp rise in cases Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said.But he said low infection rates in Southern England mean that a national lockdown would be ineffective, and would inflict unnecessary economic damage.It comes as encouraging figures show infection rates in hotspots including Manchester, Liverpool and Nottingham are falling sharply.It was the highest daily figure since June 4, and Prof Van-Tam warned the number will continue to rise again.

 <p>     </p> <p>Prof Van-Tam said: "We are trying to walk a very fine line between getting the virus under control in areas where it is out of control and incurring the minimum amount of economic damage in doing so.</p> <p>"In areas where it is out of control hard measures are needed.</p> <p>"But do I think right now it is appropriate to insist on those similar hard measures in, for example, the South West of England or Kent, where levels of the disease are very, very much lower than in the North of England - the national firebreak you talked about? No, I don't think that is right.</p> <p>"I don't think that is consistent with the epidemiological picture that we are seeing."</p>

   <p>Earlier today the Department of Health and Social Care announced that 241 people had died after contracting Covid-19, bringing the official death toll to 43,967.</p> <p>It was the highest daily figure since June 4, and Prof Van-Tam warned the number will continue to rise again.</p> <p>He said: "Part of that surge in deaths is related to the weekly pattern of slightly lower figures at the weekend, and then a kind of catch-up earlier in the week.</p> <p>"But overall is the trend upwards? Yes.</p>

 <p>"Do I expect the trend in deaths to continue upwards? Yes, unfortunately I do."</p> <p>This evening <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> announced Tier 3 regulations will be put in place from midnight on Friday in Greater Manchester, despite being accused of withholding vital support for affected residents and businesses.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>A furious Andy Burnham, mayor of Manchester, blasted the government, saying: "At no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities through the punishing reality of the winter to come."</p> <p>The government said the measure was essential to prevent overloading the NHS, and ministers have hinted that other areas could follow into Tier 3.</p></div>

Apple is expected to reveal four new iPhones in a livestreamed event at 6pm, with the company expected to announce an iPhone 12 which will be able to connect to 5G networks.

Early reports suggest the company's new flagship smartphone will have a 5.4-inch screen and a possible larger iPhone 12 Max with a 6.1-inch screen. Rumours have it that these phones will come with dual rear cameras.

There will also be a more powerful iPhone 12 Pro with a 6.1-inch screen and a larger iPhone 12 Pro Max coming in with a 6.7-inch display. These phones are said to come with triple rear cameras, similar to last year's iPhone 11 Pro.

Follow along on this liveblog from 6pm UK time.

Apple is also expected to launch the cheapest iPhone 12, likely to be referred to as the "Mini" edition, at a price of either £649 or £699, according to analysts. This fits with the company's revised pricing strategy in recent years which has seen it back away from the £999 entry point for its flagship iPhone X released in 2017.

The company will most likely make several other announcements alongside the iPhones, including a mini version of its HomePod speaker.

Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the TechCrunch series that recaps the latest OS news, the applications they support and the money that flows through it all.

The app industry is as hot as ever, with a record 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in consumer spending in 2019. People are now spending three hours and 40 minutes per day using apps, rivaling TV. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a combined $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.

In this series, we help you keep up with the latest news from the world of apps, delivered on a weekly basis.

Top Stories

Apple declared monopoly by U.S. House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust

Apple was one of the four big tech companies the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust declared as having enjoyed monopoly power in the U.S. The report suggests that Congress make changes to break up their businesses. In Apple’s case, the company was deemed to have market power in the app distribution business, meaning its App Store. The report agrees that while the App Store provides significant benefits to both consumers and developers, Apple has also controlled the App Store in a way that allows it to create barriers to competition and exploits developer data to its advantage.

Apple responded that it “vehemently” disagrees with the report’s conclusions…”with respect to Apple.”:

Our company does not have a dominant market share in any category where we do business. From its beginnings 12 years ago with just 500 apps, we’ve built the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for users to discover and download apps and a supportive way for developers to create and sell apps globally. Hosting close to two million apps today, the App Store has delivered on that promise and met the highest standards for privacy, security and quality. The App Store has enabled new markets, new services and new products that were unimaginable a dozen years ago, and developers have been primary beneficiaries of this ecosystem. Last year in the United States alone, the App Store facilitated $138 billion in commerce with over 85% of that amount accruing solely to third-party developers. Apple’s commission rates are firmly in the mainstream of those charged by other app stores and gaming marketplaces. Competition drives innovation, and innovation has always defined us at Apple. We work tirelessly to deliver the best products to our customers, with safety and privacy at their core, and we will continue to do so.

Apple in the past year has received an increasing number of complaints from iOS app developers over its rules to include in-app purchases and to remove any mentions from their app as to where consumers could pay for a subscription outside the App Store. The company has had high-profile debacles with Basecamp’s email app Hey, Spotify, Epic Games (where it’s engaged in a lawsuit) and cloud gaming services, like xCloud and Stadia.

This week, more developer complaints also surfaced related to how Apple can abuse its power.

In one, ProtonMail’s CEO shared what it was like to work with Apple, where he compared the company’s business practices to “Mafia extortion.” The company said Apple made it add in-app purchases, even though its app had been a largely free app, like WordPress, for years. When ProtonMail alerted its customers over email, Apple threatened to remove the app and block all updates.

In another, Apple told private messaging app Telegram what’s allowed on its channels. Specifically, it wanted channels closed where Belarusian protesters were identifying members of the country’s oppressive regime.

Microsoft digs at Apple with adoption of “App Fairness” principles

Last month, a number of top app makers came together to launch the “Coalition for App Fairness,” an advocacy group fighting back at market power abuses by the tech giants, namely Apple and to some lesser extent, Google. This week Microsoft joined Apple’s critics by announcing it would adopt 10 “app fairness” principles in its own Microsoft Store for Windows 10. The company didn’t reference Apple by name, but said it had “concerns about app stores on other digital platforms.”

In a blog post, Microsoft wrote:

Windows 10 is an open platform. Unlike some other popular digital platforms, developers are free to choose how they distribute their apps. The Microsoft Store is one way. We believe that it provides significant benefits to consumers and to developers by ensuring that the available apps meet strong privacy, security and safety standards, while making them easier to find and providing additional tools and services so developers can focus on development.

The company pointed out that it allows third-party app stores, like those from Epic and Steam, on Windows. It also says users can pick their own payment method and notes that developers are allowed to distribute their apps on their own terms via the internet without restrictions. And, Microsoft stressed that it would not use its market power to “tilt the playing field to our advantage.”

Though it is admirable for Microsoft to take a stand, the company is likely more concerned with ensuring U.S. regulators don’t turn their eyes to its own storefronts as they investigate tech giants for anticompetitive behavior. In particular, it wants to avoid scrutiny of its Xbox store, which will not apply these same principles.

It’s worth noting, too, that Apple’s own desktop platform, macOS, doesn’t restrict developers from offering their apps for installation via the web, so the Microsoft Store is not the most apt comparison to what’s taking place on the iOS App Store.

Consumers spent a record $28 billion in apps in Q3

Mobile usage continues to remain high amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which has prompted social distancing measures and lockdown policies, and has pushed consumers to connect online for work, school and socializing. This, in turn, has helped drive record spending in apps during the quarter, as well as a huge surge in time spent in apps. According to a new report from App Annie, consumers in the third quarter downloaded 33 billion new apps globally and spent a record $28 billion in apps — up 20% year-over-year. They also spent more than 180 billion collective hours each month of July, August and September 2020 using apps, an increase of 25% year-over-year.

For comparison, Sensor Tower’s Q3 report had estimated app revenue grew to over $29 billion in Q3, while it pegged new app downloads higher at 36.5 billion.

Apple extended the deadline for app updates using the UIWebView API to beyond the end of 2020. Apple designed WKWebView in 2014 to integrate web content into an app “quickly, securely, and consistently across iOS and macOS,” the company says. Its since recommended that developers adopt WKWebView instead of UIWebView and WebView — both of which were formally deprecated. Maybe Apple didn’t want any more stories about app rejections right now?

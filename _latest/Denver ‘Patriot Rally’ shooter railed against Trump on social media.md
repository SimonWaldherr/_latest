The unlicensed security guard accused of fatally shooting a Navy veteran at a Denver “Patriot Rally” railed against President Trump and shared left-wing political content on social media.

Matthew Dolloff‘s ex-girlfriend, told the Daily Mail, she dated Dolloff from 2010 to 2013, and during that time period, the former couple were both heavily involved in Occupy Denver — the local branch of Occupy Wall Street.

Dolloff, 35, a registered Democrat, includes dozens of political posts on his Facebook profile dating back to 2011 in which he railed against Republicans including President Trump in June 2016, when he shared a screenshot of Trump in a CNN interview, captioning it “F–k this guy.”

A few weeks later, he shared the following encounter, “Ran into a Trump supporter with a Trump Button on their shirt. Told them i like their ‘im a racist’ button. They had nothing to say. ].”

In another photo, he is seen raising his fist above a crowd while holding a folded American flag and wearing a pin that reads “We are the 99%.”

In 2016, Dolloff shared several photos of a Sanders campaign rally, calling for his friends to vote for the progressive candidate.

Right-wing influencers seized on social media postings to pin him as a leftist and claim the shooting was politically motivated. Meanwhile, some local politicians condemned the rush to blame.

The Denver police confirmed that the suspect had “no affiliation with Antifa,” though right-wing figures have been quick to allege political connections.

The ex-girlfriend, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed Dolloff “isn’t Antifa or associated with BLM.” She continued, “He shares a lot of of the same views and yes, was heavily involved with Occupy Denver/Wall Street but hasn’t, from my knowledge been involved in any activism for the last five-plus years.”

“I can’t really speak on who he is today, but if he’s anything like the Matt I remember, he really is a good guy who would go out of his way to help someone in need.”

“He would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. I can’t defend his actions on Saturday, but he’s not a bad guy,” she concluded.

Dolloff is facing first-degree murder charges in the shooting death of Lee Keltner, 49, who was shot once in the head by Dolloff following a confrontation after a “Patriot Rally” demonstration in the Mile High City.

John Francis Harcourt Baring was born on November 2 1928, the elder son of Alec Baring, 6th Lord Ashburton, and his wife Doris, daughter of the 1st Viscount Harcourt.

John was educated at Eton – where as coach of the shooting eight he competed for the inter-schools Ashburton Shield – and Trinity College, Oxford. He entered Baring Bros in 1950 despite some discouragement from his father, a long-serving but (by his son’s account) “not tremendously keen” managing director there: “I don’t know why you would want to go into the City now,” he told his son. “I think it’s all over.”

The bank’s rule was that a family member could have a job but must start at the bottom – as a clerk on a high stool, sorting post, writing ledgers in longhand – and would be swiftly expelled if incompetent. “Pretty dull work,” John recalled, “but if a man can’t get through dullness he won’t get places.”

Having passed that test he was ushered into the partners’ room in 1955 and was one of the architects in the late 1960s of a restructuring designed to preserve independence and keep death duties at bay, by converting the firm from a partnership to a company owned largely by a charitable trust, the Baring Foundation.

After a discreet power struggle, John Baring succeeded his kinsman Lord Cromer (the former Bank of England governor, who had been appointed Ambassador in Washington) as chairman of the firm’s executive committee in 1971.

Under his cautious helmsmanship over the decade that followed, wrote another commentator, “Barings enjoyed a certain amount of growth, mainly abroad, but without any expectation (or perhaps wish) of returning to the great days.”

When the opportunities of the City’s Big Bang reforms presented themselves in the mid-1980s, his board’s chief concern was to keep control of their business and its good name, rather than follow other historic firms that had chosen to join larger combinations.

But what had been a proudly old-fashioned merchant bank of just 300 staff when John Baring took charge was rapidly evolving: the Victorian office in Bishopsgate where he had started work, with its antique system of pulleys and baskets for moving paperwork between floors, had been replaced by a glass tower; numbers had grown so much by 1986 that he was no longer able to address every employee by name when he made a Christmas tour; and younger executives in the firm were hungry to reap the rich rewards of the new era.

It was on Ashburton’s watch in 1984 that the bank recruited a team of Japanese specialists from the stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite under the leadership of Christopher Heath, who became the City’s highest-paid executive by the end of the decade as the Baring Securities operation grew to 1,000 staff around the world. It was a divergence from Barings’ traditional milieu that would come spectacularly to grief in 1995 due to fraudulent and ill-controlled trading in Singapore by Nick Leeson.

That calamity struck some months after Ashburton had finally retired from the boards of the bank and its holding company. But he was still chairman of the trustees of the Baring Foundation, by then the group’s sole ordinary shareholder and one of the UK’s largest grant-giving charities, but which suffered a catastrophic wipe-out of capital from the collapse.

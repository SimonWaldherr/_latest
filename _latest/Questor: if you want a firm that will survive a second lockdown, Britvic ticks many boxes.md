  Questor: if you want a firm that will survive a second lockdown, Britvic ticks many boxes

  The second wave of lockdowns is as unpredictable as it is controversial but has hardened at least one certainty: that economic recovery, when it comes, will be far from V-shaped.They need good market positions, familiar brands, to be well invested and with strong balance sheets to see them through the worst.Because it is not only alcoholic tipples that have experienced a rise in living room consumption this year, Britvic ticks many of those boxes.For the year so far turnover is down by 5.1pc.About 40pc of group sales come from the on-trade – pubs and restaurants – with the balance from supermarkets and convenience stores.

<p>It&#160;is a state of affairs to drive us all to drink, as long as we can find a pub or bar still open to serve us. The second wave of lockdowns is as unpredictable as it is controversial but has hardened at least one certainty: that economic recovery, when it comes, will be far from V-shaped.</p>
<p>Investors who are increasingly confined to their home should consider which companies can thrive if confinement spreads. They need good market positions, familiar brands, to be well invested and with strong balance sheets to see them through the worst. Because it is not only alcoholic tipples that have experienced a rise in living room consumption this year, Britvic ticks many of those boxes.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its juices and cordials &#8211; including Robinsons, J20 and Fruit Shoot &#8211; but fizzy drinks make up the biggest part of its business. That&#8217;s because it has been soda giant Pepsi&#8217;s sole bottling partner in Great Britain for 30&#160;years and counting.</p>
<p>In the April to June quarter&#160;Britvic reported a&#160;16.3pc decline in revenue &#8211; catastrophic in normal times but really rather modest compared with some of the trading seen in the outlets it supplies. For the year so far turnover is down by 5.1pc. About 40pc of group sales come from the on-trade &#8211; pubs and restaurants &#8211; with the balance from supermarkets and convenience stores. Grocery data suggests it has been gaining market share in home&#160;consumption.</p>

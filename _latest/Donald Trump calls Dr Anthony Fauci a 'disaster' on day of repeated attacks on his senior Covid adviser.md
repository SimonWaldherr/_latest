<p>The US president&#8217;s repeated swipes at the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases escalated a clash that has been simmering for months but also dominated coverage with just two weeks left to the election.</p>
<p>"Fauci is a disaster. If I listened to him, we'd have 500,000 deaths,&#8221; Mr Trump said in a morning call with his campaign that reporters were allowed to listen in on. He continued to voice similar criticism throughout the day.&#160;</p>
<p>Mr Trump appeared to have been triggered by a high-profile interview Dr Fauci gave on Sunday where he said he was not surprised the US president caught Covid-19 given the &#8220;super-spreader&#8221; event he held at the White House to reveal his <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/09/23/thousands-pay-respects-ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court-judge/">Supreme Court nominee</a>.&#160;</p>

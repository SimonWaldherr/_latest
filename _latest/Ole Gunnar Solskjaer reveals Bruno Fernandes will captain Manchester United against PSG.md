<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;All the players are driven and you need all of the different characters to complete a very good team.&#8217;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Solskjaer&#8217;s decision is also timely, coming on the back of speculation in Portugal last week that Fernandes is losing faith in his manager.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The player subsequently denied any discord and his performance in the 4-1 victory at Newcastle on Saturday was not that of a man harbouring issues. &#8216;Bruno has definitely come in and had a great positive impact,&#8217; said Solskjaer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;That was the turning point of our season. If he has not changed the team, then he&#8217;s sparked something in the team and I hope we&#8217;ve sparked something in his career.&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would be intriguing to know what Paul Pogba, who is already said to be unhappy that Fernandes occupies the advanced role he covets, thinks of his team-mate&#8217;s promotion.</p><img id="i-2823c9cc1803dcb3" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="410" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-2823c9cc1803dcb3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/18/34582598-0-image-a-61_1603129945206.jpg" height="410" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="clear"></p><p class="imageCaption">Despite United's poor start to 2020-21 Fernandes has shone, with three goals and three assists</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not long ago, Pogba would have been a prime candidate to step in for Maguire but he landed back in France on Moday with his United career once again in stagnation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maguire was not the only absentee when the squad left Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">New signing Edinson Cavani, the former PSG striker who was desperate to face his old club, stayed to build up his fitness after training just twice at Carrington.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric Bailly, Jesse Lingard and Mason Greenwood also miss the trip, with Solskjaer denying that the latter&#8217;s exclusion had anything to do with a disciplinary issue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The situation could be compared to United&#8217;s last visit to Paris in March 2019 when an under-strength side stunned Paris Saint-Germain to win on away goals. But Solskjaer was not about to get carried away by the nostalgia of his finest hour as the club&#8217;s manager. &#8216;That&#8217;s history for us,&#8217; he said. &#8216;It&#8217;s in the past.</p><img id="i-c3ec284a5f7bceb9" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="633" width="634" alt="Edinson Cavani was desperate to face his old club but has been forced to stay in Manchester" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-c3ec284a5f7bceb9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/22/34586330-8856231-Edinson_Cavani_was_desperate_to_face_his_old_club_but_has_been_f-a-16_1603144143077.jpg" height="633" width="634" alt="Edinson Cavani was desperate to face his old club but has been forced to stay in Manchester" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Edinson Cavani was desperate to face his old club but has been forced to stay in Manchester</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;It&#8217;s great history, a great game, but it has no impact whatsoever on this game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;We&#8217;re a different team, they&#8217;re a different team and it&#8217;s a different stage of the competition. Without supporters, it will also be a different game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;I thought last time when we got the early goal that impacted the crowd. So it&#8217;s a new situation.&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PSG boss Thomas Tuchel was equally happy to consign that game to history and even ignore his team&#8217;s run to the Champions League final in August, as he was asked if they are favourites to win this Group H opener.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;We don&#8217;t have good memories,&#8217; said Tuchel. &#8216;We had a great run last season in the Champions League and now it&#8217;s a challenge not to think too much about last season or two seasons ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;It&#8217;s a new page. This is a tough competition and to think whether we are the favourites won&#8217;t help now.'&#160;</p></div>

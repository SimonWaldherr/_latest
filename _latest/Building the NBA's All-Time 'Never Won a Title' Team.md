Dominique Wilkins

One of the greatest scorers of all time, Dominique "The Human Highlight Film" Wilkins is top-15 all-time in both career points and career points per game.

He never made it past the second round in the postseason, though. Being in the Eastern Conference for a significant chunk of Larry Bird's career certainly didn't help.

Artis Gilmore

His most productive seasons came in the ABA, but Artis Gilmore did plenty of damage after the merger, too. Over his first 10 NBA seasons, Gilmore averaged 19.0 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.1 blocks.

Like Wilkins, though, much of his career was played during an era largely dominated by Bird and Magic Johnson.

George Gervin

Another ABA product, George Gervin was one of the league's best scorers in the 1970s and '80s.

He won the scoring title in four out of five seasons from 1977-78 to 1981-82. And the distance between his 29.8 points per game in that stretch and Moses Malone's second-place 26.1 was about the same as the distance between second and eighth.

Reggie Miller

Reggie Miller was ahead of his time. You know about the three-point shooting. What doesn't get as much publicity is his ability to get to the line.

Chauncey Billups, Spencer Dinwiddie, Danilo Gallinari and James Harden are the only players in league history who exceed Miller's career marks for three-point attempt rate and free-throw attempt rate.

Bob Lanier

Bob Lanier was one of the game's early point big men.

Among centers with career averages of at least 20 points and 10 rebounds, Lanier trails only Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and DeMarcus Cousins in assists per game.

Patrick Ewing

Magic and Bird prevented a lot of the '80s stars from winning titles. Michael Jordan was the foil in the '90s. And Patrick Ewing is one of the stars who had much of his prime spoiled by MJ.

That shouldn't detract from his individual greatness, though. Over a 10-year peak from 1987-88 to 1996-97, Ewing averaged 24.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.8 blocks and 1.0 steals.

Steve Nash

If you sort every team across NBA history by relative offensive rating (a team's points per 100 possessions minus the league average), you'll find that Steve Nash was the starting point guard for each of the top two, five of the top nine and six of the top 15.

His five assist titles and third-place spot on the all-time assist leaderboard are impressive, but his command of those all-time-great offenses says even more.

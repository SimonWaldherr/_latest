Dr. Liz Theoharis is the director of the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary. They are co-chairs of the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion on CNN.</p><p>(CNN) On Thursday evening, Americans have one last chance to hear President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden on the same stage for 90 minutes. While neither candidate is likely to change course or depart from their stump speech, Americans deserve to hear both candidates address the pressing issue of poverty.</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, according to two studies, the number of Americans officially living in poverty has grown by six to eight million . These estimates, which come as a direct result of Congress and the Trump administration's failure to pass a new aid package , are likely conservative.</p><p>Even before the pandemic, our research with the Institute for Policy Studies found that 140 million people in this country were poor , or one fire, storm, health care crisis, or job loss away from it.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">As religious leaders and co-chairs of the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, our work is rooted in communities where people live every day in and on the edge of crisis. By the time we reach November 3, too many of America's 140 million poor and low-income people will have lost loved ones whose hands they couldn't hold, but whose bills and medical debt they must pay. They will have lost jobs and timed out of unemployment insurance. They will have lost their homes. </p><p>Poor and low-income people now face the enormous pressures of staying safe at home, at work and all the places in between. They are managing the ups and downs of remote learning and hybrid classrooms and facing every day without any assurance that things will get better. Our federal government's failure to provide relief is nothing less than what we call policy violence -- suffering that results directly from the decisions of those who wield political power.</p><p class="el__video__close--standard js__video__close--standard el__storyelements--close cnn-icon"></p><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="Homeless Americans among most vulnerable in pandemic" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"><p class="img__preloader"></p><img alt="Homeless Americans among most vulnerable in pandemic" class="media__image" src="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200805091835-homeless-large-169.jpg"><p class="js-video-demand media__video--demand"></p><p class="js-video-demand media__video--demand"></p><p id="spinner_body-text_10" class="video-red-spinner"></p><img alt="Homeless Americans among most vulnerable in pandemic" class="media__image" src="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200805091835-homeless-large-169.jpg"><a class="el__video__replay-button-wrapper" href="" title="Click to watch this video"><p class="js-el__video__replay-button el__video__replay-button"></p></a><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-0"><h3 class="cd__headline-title">JUST WATCHED</h3><h2 class="cd__headline"><p class="cd__headline-text js-cd__headline-text">Homeless Americans among most vulnerable in pandemic</p></h2></ul><a class="js-video__end-slate__replay"><p class="video__end-slate__replay-icon cnn-icon"></p></a><a class="js-video__end-slate__replay-text video__end-slate__replay-text">Replay</a><a href="/videos" class="video__end-slate__replay-text">More Videos ...</a><h4 class="video__end-slate__tertiary-title">MUST WATCH</h4><p class="js-video__end-slate__carousel video__end-slate__carousel"></p><p id="body-text_10" class="media__video--responsive "></p><p class="metadata__source"></p><p class="media__caption el__storyelement__title"><p class="el__storyelement__header">Homeless Americans among most vulnerable in pandemic</p> <p class="el__storyelement__gray">03:20</p></p><a></a><p>These 140 million Americans are not "red" or "blue."

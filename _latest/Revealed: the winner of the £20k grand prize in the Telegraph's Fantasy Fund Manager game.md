After three months of thrills and spills in the stock market, there is finally a winner of the Telegraph Fantasy Fund Manager game and its coveted £20,000 prize.

Potofgold turned £100,000 into £165,000 – an impressive 65pc return when the FTSE 350 fell by 3pc – to take the top spot among almost 15,000 players.

The fund was managed by investment hobbyist Mike Langton, a 56-year-old doctor from Yorkshire. While he has no professional investment experience, he does manage his own pension and Isa. Read about his winning strategy here.

It was all to play for in the final two weeks, with Mr Langton's fund climbing 26pc in value to comfortably finish first. It was eight percentage points ahead of second place, which returned 57pc. Just seven players made over 50pc.

The game took a number of dramatic swings which potofgold navigated expertly. Gold miners initially shone as markets went into panic mode about the health of the global economy and the prospects of lockdown-affected businesses. It then swung in favour of beaten-up companies staging a rebound, including airlines and leisure groups.

Ultimately, agile fund managers won out. Potofgold reached the top by placing well-timed bets on gold miners then picking up companies in unloved sectors. The player managed to be in the right place at the right time with positions in William Hill, which jumped 40pc in value after a takeover bid became public, and Pets at Home, which posted bumper results after profiting from greater demand for pets over the lockdown period.

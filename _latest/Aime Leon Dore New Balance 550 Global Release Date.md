Earlier in the month, Aime Leon Dore teamed up with New Balance once again to bring back the retro 550 silhouette, a basketball-styled oxford that faded into the shadows of the brand’s many iconic runners. And among the expansive five colorways, it seems just one — the red-accented pair — will be hitting global in the coming week.

Vintage not only in its color but also its construction, the pair is built foundationally atop a yellowed tooling, one that complements well the leather upper above. Perforated side-panels as well as the smooth toe boxes and counters impart neutral visuals, while the bold red accents adjacent make up for where the aforementioned lacks. Chenille logos are dressed along the side in the shape of the classic “N,” “550” is embroidered right along the toe box with dark black outline, and the tongue is stamped by a special basketball/New York inspired logo hit that also hits the heel. Further use of red then rounds off the palette through the back tread, collar, and lining.

Grab a detailed look at these yet again right here and expect to see a release soon at select retailers.

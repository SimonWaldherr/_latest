Instead of a national circuit-breaker the Government is backing treatment and vaccine development, as well as creating a "huge diagnostics industry from scratch", he said.

The Prime Minister then turned his focus to asymptomatic patients, who "unknowingly pass the disease to the vulnerable".

So far it has been difficult to prevent this, but that is changing, he said.

There are new tests which are "faster, simpler and cheaper", he said. "Though there is work to do, it's becoming clear over the past few weeks that some of these new tests are highly effective and can help save lives and jobs over the winter," he added.

The Government has already bought "millions of these tests, some of which are very simple", he said, and can have a result within 15 minutes.

The Government has started the process to begin domestic manufacturing and they will begin testing NHS and care home staff more regularly, he said. That will help prevent the spread of the virus through care homes, and students can be tested without breaks in their education.

Those in the very high alert level will be prioritised for these tests.

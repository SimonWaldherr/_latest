Andy Preston, the Independent Mayor of Middlesbrough, said Tier 2 restrictions would effectively force businesses to close in the city due to a lack of financial support.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "What's happening right now as we speak, there are people getting ready to close their businesses.

"The Government hasn't legally told them to close, so there is no financial package directly available, but they are effectively being told to close because their customers aren't coming because they are not allowed to mix with friends, relatives and other people in the restaurants or the bars or the other venues.

"So the Government is effectively closing these venues. We need real support, real financial help now and we want to work with the Government to get through this and build a much better 2022, 2023."

Mr Preston added that there was "very little evidence that well-run bars and well-run restaurants contribute at all really to the spread of the virus", adding: "It is all exclusively transmitted in the home, at school or a place of learning or a place of work."

Asked what he made of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommending a "circuit-breaker" style lockdown, Mr Preston said he "wasn't a medical expert" but that he was "sceptical about such a harsh lockdown".

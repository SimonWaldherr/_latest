The federal budget deficit soared to an all-time record high $3.1 trillion in fiscal 2020 as revenues dipped and government spending skyrocketed to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

The deficit – or the gap between what the government spends and how much revenue it generates from taxes and other avenues – was more than three times last year's $984 billion, and $2 trillion more than what the Trump administration estimated in February, before the coronavirus started spreading widely in the U.S.

The figure, part of the annual budget summary released Friday by the Trump administration, exceeds the previous record deficit of $1.4 trillion set in 2009, during the Great Recession.

The budget report shows that government spending rose a staggering 47.3% in fiscal 2020, to $6.55 trillion. Roughly a third of that spending can be attributed to the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package passed by Congress in March. Revenues fell slightly, down 1.2% from the previous year.

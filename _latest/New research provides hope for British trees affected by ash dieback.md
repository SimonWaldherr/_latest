Naturally enough, everyone’s attention is focused right now on Covid-19, but it’s worth remembering that other pandemics are available. You may be happy if your garden has the space for a big tree, but given the apocalyptic headlines about ash dieback, you may be less happy if that tree is an ash. However, research published in the Journal of Ecology offers cause for mild optimism.

From 2012 to 2018, researchers monitored the progress of the disease in an area of about 23 square kilometres in northern France, around the ­village of Champenoux near the city of Nancy. The area included a couple of large tracts of woodland, together with areas of agricultural land with scattered hedges and small woods, plus the village itself.

In the large woods, ash was usually present at low density, along with oak and hornbeam, while many of the small woods were pure ash. Ash dieback was first reported in France in 2008, and observed for the first time in the study area in 2010. By 2012, two years later, ash dieback was observed throughout the study area, with three quarters of trees showing at least limited symptoms.

Clearly, the disease had no trouble spreading among the many ash trees present, which is hardly surprising, given the extremely effective airborne dispersal of its spores. But the researchers were surprised by what happened next.

Many trees went on to develop severe symptoms, with large amounts of canopy dieback, but almost all of these badly affected trees were in woodlands, and serious stem cankers in particular were largely confined to woodland trees. Trees out in the open, many of them in hedgerows, generally did not develop serious symptoms.

The question is: why not? A small part of the answer was the presence of other ash trees; those close to many other ash trees tended to develop more serious symptoms than those mixed up with other trees. But a much more important factor appeared to be climate.

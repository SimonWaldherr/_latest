Following in the footsteps of RoboCop and Terminator, John Rambo will be the next '80s action hero to join Mortal Kombat 11, as revealed Thursday in an epic cinematic trailer. He's voiced by none other than Sylvester Stallone and is part of the Kombat Pack 2 downloadable content (DLC) alongside Klassic fighters Rain and Mileena.

"I'm your worst nightmare," Rambo says, in that unmistakable Stallone voice, as he opens fire in the trailer.

Stallone played Rambo in five movies, from 1982's First Blood to 2019's Rambo: Last Blood.

The Kombat Pack 2 comes out Nov. 17, along with Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate -- the base game with all of the DLC included. People who own the fighting game on PS4 and Xbox One will also get free upgrades to the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions that day, adding 4K dynamic resolution, enhanced visuals, improved loading times and other features.

The fighter game, which also hit PC, Switch and Stadia last year, has developed quite a bit since it came out in March 2019. The base game had 24 playable fighters, with Shao Kahn as a preorder bonus. It added a bunch of fighters and a story epilogue as DLC, so the latest additions will bring the roster to 37.

Warner Bros. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the pricing for Kombat Pack 2 or the Ultimate version of the game, but they'll both be available to preorder next Thursday.

<div><p>PayPal to let you buy and sell cryptocurrencies in the US</p><p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank">PayPal </a> has partnered with cryptocurrency company <a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a> to <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">launch</a> a new service. PayPal users in the U.S. will soon be able to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies. More countries are coming soon.</p>
<p>PayPal plans to support Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin at first. You&#8217;ll be able to connect to your PayPal account to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Behind the scenes, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paxos" target="_blank">Paxos </a> <a href="https://www.paxos.com/paypal-paxos-bring-crypto-to-millions-of-users/">takes care</a> of trading and custody.</p>
<p>In early 2021, PayPal wants to let you use your crypto assets as a funding source for your PayPal purchases. This could be a good way to use cryptocurrencies for everyday purchases without having to convert cryptocurrencies on an exchange first.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>There are 26 million merchants that offer PayPal around the world. For those merchants, customers paying in crypto won&#8217;t have any impact. Everything will be converted to fiat currency when a transaction is settled.</p>
<p>As part of today&#8217;s move, PayPal has been granted a conditional BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Service. It should be able to launch its crypto service in partnership with Paxos in New York.</p>
<p>PayPal&#8217;s crypto service isn&#8217;t live just yet. You can head over to PayPal&#8217;s website and join the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/cryptowaitlist">waitlist</a>. The company has already <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees">updated its fees</a> with more details about cryptocurrency exchange fees.</p>
<p>The company will charge high fees on fiat-to-cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchange transactions. You can expect to pay 2.3% for transactions below $100, 2% for transactions between $100 and $200, 1.8% for transactions between $200 and $1,000 and 1.5% for transactions above $1,000. There&#8217;s a minimum fee of $0.50 for transactions below $25. The page also says that there will be some spread between buy and sell prices.</p>
<p>As a comparison, Coinbase <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/fees.html">charges</a> 1.49% in conversion fees for any transaction over $200, and a fixed fee below that amount. Square&#8217;s Cash App charges variable fees and Robinhood <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/cryptocurrency-investing/">hides</a> its fees behind some markup on market prices.</p>
<p>Revolut, which also <a href="https://www.paxos.com/paxos-revolut-crypto-mainstream/">partners</a> with Paxos in the U.S. to offer cryptocurrency trading, charges 2.5 to 3% in exchange fees for free customers. If you&#8217;re a premium user, you pay 1.5% in fees.</p>
<p>Many companies have been trying to build the PayPal of crypto. It turns out that the PayPal of crypto could just be PayPal.</p>

Many areas with surging coronavirus rates were today spared tougher lockdown restrictions by Boris Johnson.

Most of England will still currently be bound only by national measures such as the 'rule of six' and the 10pm pub curfew.

But latest figures show coronavirus cases are growing across the country still.

And analysis by Mirror Online has found 35 places currently deemed only to be 'medium' risk under the new three-tier alert system had rates of more than 100 cases per 100,000 cases for the seven days up to October 9.

Exeter in Devon has the highest rate of any area in Tier 1 at 345.5 - higher than the likes of Bolton, Bradford, Leicester and Birmingham.

The city's surging coronavirus cases have been attributed to university students.

And two of the other hardest-hit places still deemed 'medium' risks, York (219.8 cases per 100,000 people) and Charnwood (177.6), where Loughborough is, are also home to large universities.

The numbers also show that the rise in cases is far from limited to just the North of England and the Midlands.

As well as Exeter, Elmbridge in Surrey (119.9), Oxford (135.8), Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (104.2), Windsor and Maidenhead (104.3) and Three Rivers, Herts (107.2) have also recorded big rises in the South of England.

And four London boroughs, Ealing, Richmond-upon-Thames, Redbridge and Hackney & City of London all now have rates over 100 cases per 100,000 people

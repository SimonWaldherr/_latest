USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY NETWORK is partnering with The 19th to distribute content from the nonpartisan, nonprofit newsroom’s newly-launched website dedicated to original reporting at the intersection of gender, politics and policy. Starting this week, USA TODAY and more than 260 local media brands across the USA TODAY NETWORK will begin sharing stories from The 19th with the aim of informing, engaging and empowering women.

The 19th’s evidence-based reporting will expose gender inequity and injustice on the issues that most deeply affect women’s lives, from health care to the economy to the COVID-19 pandemic’s disproportionate effect on women in every arena but mortality rates. The 19th will also deeply cover the role women play in shaping our democracy, from statehouses to the White House. USA TODAY NETWORK will play a key role in bringing these important stories to readers by featuring The 19th's content across its wide national platform with deep roots in local communities across the United States.

USA TODAY NETWORK’s partnership with The 19th will bolster and broaden its ongoing journalistic commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment. Later this month, USA TODAY NETWORK’s multiplatform “Women of the Century” project, which launched earlier this year, will recognize and celebrate women from across America for their inspiring accomplishments in the 100 years since the ratification of women’s right to vote.

"We are thrilled to partner with The 19th, publishing their stories across the USA TODAY Network. Covering politics, power and policy with an emphasis on women is important as we continue to tell the story of a changing America,” said Nicole Carroll, USA TODAY editor in chief.

"The primary goal of The 19th is to get more women more deeply engaged in politics and policy — and to do that by meeting them where they are. This critical republishing partnership with the USA TODAY Network allows us to reach people in more than 260 local communities around the country, an enormous step toward accomplishing that goal," said Emily Ramshaw, co-founder and CEO of The 19th.

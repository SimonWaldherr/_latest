  Dr. Jill Biden avoids tough questions on 'The View' as hosts skip past Hunter Biden allegations 
description: > 
  Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has taken heat for a lack of media appearances, but his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, took a break from the campaign trail to join “The View” on Wednesday to answer multiple questions about President Trump.“I’m not tired,” she added before “The View” co-hosts took turns asking Biden questions that set her up to bash Trump.Behar called it a “human rights violation” and asked if the Trump administration should be held accountable.“We wouldn’t even be here if Joe were president, there would be no separation of families at the border,” she said.When her husband, the former vice president, was asked about the Post report he snapped at the reporter who posed the question.

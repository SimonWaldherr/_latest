<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The CDC had previously defined a &#8220;close contact&#8221; as someone who spent at least 15 consecutive minutes within six feet of a confirmed coronavirus case. The updated guidance, which health departments rely on to conduct contact tracing, now defines a close contact as someone who was within six feet of an infected individual for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period, according to a CDC statement Wednesday.</p><p class="powa-wrapper"></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The updated guidance is based on new evidence about transmission of the coronavirus, which causes covid-19. In a report <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943e1.htm?s_cid=mm6943e1_e&amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM40859&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2069%2C%20October%2" target="_blank">published Wednesday, </a>CDC and Vermont health officials discovered the virus was spread to a 20-year-old prison employee who interacted with individuals who later tested positive for the virus after 22 interactions with them totaling 17 minutes during an eight-hour shift.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;Available data suggests that at least one of the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/08/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-covid/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11" target="_blank"> asymptomatic </a>[infectious detainees] transmitted&#8221; the virus during these brief encounters, the report said.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The prison employee wore a cloth mask, gown and eye protection during all of the interactions. The infected individuals wore masks during most of their interactions with him, but not during several that took place in a cell doorway or prison recreation room, the report said.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;This article adds to the scientific knowledge of the risk to contacts of those with covid-19 and highlights again the importance of wearing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/20/face-mask-coronavirus-standards/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13" target="_blank">face masks </a>to prevent transmission,&#8221; the CDC said in a statement.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">As many as half of all people who have the virus don&#8217;t show symptoms, &#8220;so it&#8217;s critical to wear a mask because you could be carrying the virus and not know it,&#8221; the CDC said. &#8220;While a mask provides some limited protection to the wearer, each additional person who wears a mask increases the individual protection for everyone. When more people wear masks, more people are protected.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, called the updated guidance an important change.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to accumulate 15 minutes in small increments when you spend all day together &#8212; a few minutes at the water cooler, a few minutes in the elevator, and so on,&#8221; Rivers said. &#8220;I expect this will result in many more people being identified as close contacts.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">She added: &#8220;This change underscores the importance of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/10/08/covid-white-house-contact-tracing/?itid=lk_inline_manual_19" target="_blank">vigilant social distancing</a> &#8212; even multiple brief interactions can pose a risk.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">At the same time, Rivers said, it&#8217;s not clear whether the multiple brief encounters were the only explanation for how the prison employee became infected. Other potential pathways might have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/10/05/cdc-coronavirus-airborne-transmission/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20" target="_blank">airborne </a>or surface transmission of the virus. She also noted that the new guidance &#8220;will be difficult for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/18/cdc-reverses-controversial-coronavirus-guidelines-testing-people-without-symptoms/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20" target="_blank">contact tracing programs </a>to implement, and schools and businesses will have a difficult time operating under this guidance.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">At the Vermont prison, the employee had multiple brief encounters on July 28 with six prisoners while their coronavirus test results were pending. The next day, all six individuals tested positive. The Vermont health and correction authorities conducted a contact tracing investigation and determined the correctional officer did not meet the definition of a close contact, and he continued to work.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">But a week later, at the end of his Aug. 4 shift, the employee had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank">symptoms of covid-19</a>, including loss of smell and taste, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath, and loss of appetite. He got tested the next day and on Aug. 11, found out he was positive.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Vermont authorities reviewed July 28 video surveillance footage and determined the employee never spent 15 consecutive minutes within six feet of any of the infected individuals. But the employee did have &#8220;numerous brief (approximately one-minute) encounters that cumulatively exceeded 15 minutes.&#8221; During his eight-hour shift that day, he was within six feet of an infected person an estimated 22 times, for a total of about 17 minutes of cumulative exposure, according to the CDC report.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The officer reported no other known close contact exposures to individuals with the coronavirus outside work, and did not travel outside Vermont during the 14 days before he got sick, the report said. Investigators said &#8220;his most likely exposures occurred in the correctional facility&#8221; through the multiple brief encounters.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><b>Read more:</b></p></div>

The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably changed our lives. The past few months have brought many challenges for health care workers, providing care in difficult circumstances, going to work fearful of bringing COVID-19 home with them. For students, adapting to taking classes from home, with little contact with teachers and friends, and anxious about their futures; for workers whose livelihoods are threatened; for the vast number of people caught in poverty or in fragile humanitarian settings with extremely limited protection from COVID-19; and for people with mental health conditions, many experiencing even greater social isolation than before.

The economic consequences of the pandemic are already being felt, as companies let staff go in an effort to save their businesses, or indeed shut down completely. Taking unemployment and economic woes to an all time high. The repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic has made lives even tougher. Not only this, but the vaccinations are still being developed with the onslaught of second wave positing as a humongous threat.

Given past experience of emergencies, it is expected that the need for mental health and psychosocial support will substantially increase in the coming months and years. The purpose of this day is to ensue investment in mental health programmes at both national and international levels, which have already suffered from years of chronic underfunding, is now more important than it has ever been. This is why the goal of this year’s World Mental Health Day campaign is increased investment in mental health.

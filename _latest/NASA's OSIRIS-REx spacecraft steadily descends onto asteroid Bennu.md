  NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft steadily descends onto asteroid Bennu 
description: > 
  AdvertisementNASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is getting ready to reach out its robotic arm and collect a sample from the asteroid Bennu's surface Tuesday evening.NASAâ€™s OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft has been orbiting Bennu, which is hurtling through space at 63,000 miles per hour, for nearly two years.The 11ft sampling arm of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft (pictured) will take samples of rock and soil from Bennu when the spacecraft lands on the space rock on Tuesday October 20NASA's OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft pictured above in October 2018OSIRIS-REx will touch down for a handful of seconds on asteroid Bennu following a carefully orchestrated 4.5 hour descent.The asteroid Bennu pictured above in this NASA image dated November 16, 2018.Since December 2018 OSIRIS-REx has been orbiting Bennu and surveying its surface, spin and practicing flying close to the asteroid.

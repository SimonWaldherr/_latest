President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron, 14, contracted coronavirus earlier this month at the same time both of his parents were ill, first lady Melania Trump wrote in a statement post Wednesday.

When Trump was diagnosed with Covid-19, a statement released by his physician said that his children had tested negative. But Melania Trump said a day after testing negative, her son tested positive.

The teenager, who has maintained a low profile while his father has been president, experienced no symptoms and has since tested negative.

Melania Trump said she experienced a "roller coaster of symptoms."

"Naturally my mind went immediately to our son," she wrote. "To our great relief he tested negative, but again, as so many parents have thought over the past several months, I couldn’t help but think 'what about tomorrow or the next day?' My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive."

She praised the medical care the first family received, saying it made her "even more grateful and in awe of caretakers and first responders everywhere."

"I was very fortunate as my diagnosis came with minimal symptoms, though they hit me all at once and it seemed to be a roller coaster of symptoms in the days after," she added. "I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time. I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food."

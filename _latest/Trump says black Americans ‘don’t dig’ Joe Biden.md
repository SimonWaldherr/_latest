President Trump on Friday said black voters “don’t dig” Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

“The black community gets it. They don’t dig him, they don’t like him,” Trump told radio host Rush Limbaugh during a “virtual rally” as he recovers from COVID-19.

Trump said he believes he’s going to win an increased share of the black vote after winning an estimated 8 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 88 percent share in 2016.

“They don’t like Biden. He did the super-predator stuff, you know he was the super-predator king,” Trump said, referring to criticism of the Biden-sponsored 1994 crime law that’s credited with contributing to the mass incarceration of black people.

“I’m getting numbers, you know, we’re at 20 percent, 22 precent, which, not that I’m proud of that because it should be 100 percent,” Trump said.

“If you look at what I’ve done for criminal justice reform, [President Barack] Obama couldn’t get criminal justice reform done, I did. Prison reform, the small colleges and universities, historically black, what I’ve done I got them funded.”

He added: “With [South Carolina Sen.] Tim Scott we did the opportunity zones, which is the greatest I’ve made the most incredible thing for the black community, the African American community with jobs and everything else.”

Trump repeated his frequent claim that “I’ve done more for the black community than anybody since Abraham Lincoln.”

At the Wednesday vice presidential debate, Vice President Mike Pence slammed Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), whose father is black, for racial disparities while she was San Francisco district attorney from 2004 to 2011.

“When you were DA in San Francisco, when you left office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics,” Pence said.

In August, Biden apologized after he said the black community lacked intellectual diversity.

“Unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community, with incredibly different attitudes about different things,” Biden said, later going on Twitter to clarify the remark.

He also regretted his comments during a May radio interview with Charlamagne Tha God when talking about African Americans voting for Trump.

“You’ve got more questions?” Biden told the host. “Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”

Biden later walked back the comments as him being too “cavalier.”

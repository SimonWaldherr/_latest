<div><p>This year has proven to be one of the toughest in history&#160;for retailers. Lockdown meant a lack of occasions to buy new clothes for, while the inevitable uncertainty surrounding the economy meant shoppers generally are watching their spending. It&#8217;s meant that on high streets up and down the country, brands are facing financial trouble - just last week we <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/brands/clarks-closes-50-stores-has-britain-fallen-love-classic-shoe/">reported that Clarks planned to close</a> 50 of its stores, while John Lewis announced 1,300 job losses.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>While a shift in shopping behaviours was definitely on the cards pre-pandemic, with more time to&#160;consider how clothes are being made, and just how much of them we really need, consumers have been shopping more consciously than ever. Support for small businesses has been at an all-time high in the past six months, too: high street behemoths have been shunned in favour of transparent independent labels who&#8217;ve needed a helping hand to stay afloat.</p>
<p>As such, lockdown success stories are seemingly more common for independent retailers.&#160;Small British brand Kemi Telford is one such little label.</p>

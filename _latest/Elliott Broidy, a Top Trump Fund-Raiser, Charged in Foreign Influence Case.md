And Mr. Broidy began aggressively promoting his connection to the new administration to politicians, business executives and governments around the world. His defense company won big contracts from the United Arab Emirates and Angola. And Mr. Broidy offered a trip to Mar-a-Lago to an Angolan politician from whom he was seeking to collect additional payments.

But the charge against Mr. Broidy is not related to his defense company or its clients.

Rather, it stems from his arrangement with Mr. Low, a flamboyant Malaysian financier who federal authorities have said played a key role in the looting of 1MDB, and who is said to have subsequently spent on extravagances like paintings by Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet and the financing of the Hollywood film “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

Mr. Low, who is believed to be living in China, was charged in the United States in 2018 in connection with the 1MDB theft, but he has not appeared in criminal court in the United States or Malaysia, where he was also charged.

The filing said that Mr. Broidy and a pair of associates agreed in 2017 to work for Mr. Low “to orchestrate back-channel, unregistered campaigns to lobby the administration,” including the Justice Department, to “end the 1MDB matters” and to remove a Chinese citizen from the United States “and send him back to” China.

The Chinese citizen is not identified by name in the filing, but he is known to be the billionaire dissident Guo Wengui, an outspoken critic of China who has been charged by its government with corruption and is seeking asylum in the United States.

Some of Mr. Broidy’s associates involved in the arrangement have already been charged, including Nickie Lum Davis, a political fund-raiser who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Another person involved in the effort, George Higginbotham, a former Justice Department employee, pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiring to lie to banks about the source of tens of millions of dollars he funneled into the United States from Mr. Low.

In his guilty plea, Mr. Higginbotham admitted that he and the entertainer and businessman Pras Michel, a former member of the Fugees, a defunct hip-hop group, arranged for millions of dollars of Mr. Low’s money to be transferred to a law firm owned by Mr. Broidy’s wife to pay them to try to end the 1MDB investigation.

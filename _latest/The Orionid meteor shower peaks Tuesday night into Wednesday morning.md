description: > 
  The annual Orionid meteor shower will reach its climax in the early hours of Wednesday morning.Keep your eyes to the sky late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning: You might get to see the peak of the Orionids, the best meteor shower of the fall.The annual Orionid meteor shower will reach its climax in the early hours of Wednesday morning, featuring around 20 meteors per hour across much of the globe, AccuWeather said.More good news: The moon is in a waxing crescent phase, setting before midnight, providing dark skies for this year’s Orionid meteor shower, EarthSky said.Overall, “the Orionids are a medium strength shower that sometimes reaches high strength activity,” the American Meteor Society reports.

This averages out to a meteor every few minutes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Meteors in annual showers are named for the point in our sky from which they appear to radiate," according to <a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-orionid-meteor-shower" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">EarthSky</a>. "The radiant point for the Orionids is in the direction of the famous constellation Orion the Hunter, which you&#8217;ll find ascending in the east in the hours after midnight. Hence the name Orionids."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The best time to watch begins from about 1 or 2 a.m. local daylight time until the first light of dawn (at around 5:45 a.m.), when Orion stands highest above the southern horizon, <a href="https://www.space.com/orionid-meteor-shower-2020-peaks-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Space.com</a> said. "The higher in the sky Orion is, the more meteors appear all over the sky."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">To view the shower, try to avoid light pollution (if possible) and don't use binoculars or telescopes, weather.com said. Though the meteors will emanate from the eastern horizon, they will streak across the entire sky and will be visible from anywhere on Earth, according to NASA.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="An Orionid meteor shoots across the sky on Oct. 19, 2017.

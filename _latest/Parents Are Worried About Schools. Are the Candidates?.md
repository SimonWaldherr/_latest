  Parents Are Worried About Schools. Are the Candidates? 
description: > 
  Communities large and small are battling over whether and how to reopen schools closed since March.But with so many families deeply affected by the pandemic’s upending of school routines and potentially lasting impact on childhood learning, the lack of thoughtful focus on the issue has frustrated parents and educators alike.“It should really be a pivotal topic,” said Kisha Hale, principal of the upper grades at Eagle Academy Public Charter School in Washington, which has been providing virtual instruction to its largely low-income students since March.“With Covid-19, there are so many other things taking the focus away from education.But if our future doctors, teachers and lawyers can’t be properly prepared during this time and we’re not talking about it, what is it that we are saying really matters?”

Superintendents are warning of drastic budget cuts on the horizon, teachers&#8217; unions are calling for standardized tests to be canceled for a second straight year and millions of children are learning remotely, with little evaluation of the impact on their academic growth.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Yet for months now, the extraordinary challenges of schooling during the coronavirus pandemic have not been a dominant campaign theme for either President Trump or his opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That is partly because states and local districts have a larger role than the federal government in funding and running schools.

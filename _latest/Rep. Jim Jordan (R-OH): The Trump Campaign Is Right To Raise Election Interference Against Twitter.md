</p><p>On Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla, Rep. Jim Jordan discussed the censoring of the New York Post's article about Hunter Biden by Twitter and how conservative accounts were blocked, including the account of the House Republican Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>"Of course it does. And anyone with common sense can see this. Big tech has a bias against conservatives. Big tech is out to get conservatives. And that's not speculation. That's not suspicion. That is fact because big tech will let the Ayatollah put a tweet up that says he will strike a blow against American citizens. That's fine, but they'll censor the President. Yesterday, they censored the House Republican Judiciary account, our committee account. They censored that and said later, this is always amazes me, it was just a glitch. If you had a nickel for every time they said it was just a glitch in the algorithm, we'd all be wealthy now.  So, of course, it's election interference and the Trump campaign is right to raise that particularly two and half weeks before the election."</p>

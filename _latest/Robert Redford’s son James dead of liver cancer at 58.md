<div><p>James Redford, the son of actor and filmmaker Robert Redford, died Friday, Oct. 16, at age 58. He died at his home in Marin County, Calif., after a battle with bile-duct cancer in his liver, <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2020/10/19/james-redford-filmmaker/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Salt Lake Tribune</a>, and had been awaiting a liver transplant.</p>
<p>His death was confirmed by his wife, Kyle Redford, on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;James died today. We&#8217;re heartbroken. He lived a beautiful, impactful life &amp; was loved by many,&#8221; Kyle <a href="https://twitter.com/kyleredford/status/1317232446849437697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in a tweet</a>, which included several family photos. &#8220;As his wife of 32 yrs, I&#8217;m most grateful for the two spectacular children we raised together. I don&#8217;t know what we would&#8217;ve done w/o them over the past 2yrs.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2005, James and his father co-founded the Redford Center, which &#8220;uses impact-driven film and media to accelerate environmental and climate justice, solutions and repair,&#8221; according to its website. Its executive director, Jill Tidman, shared a lengthy remembrance of James on Instagram, saying, &#8220;With Jamie came love and contagious joy. He approached everything he did with kindness and warmth, and an openness that spread itself easily among others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Redford, now 84, has not issued a statement.</p>
 
<p>Like his legendary father, James was a filmmaker, though his work was primarily in the documentary field. He told the Salt Lake Tribune in 2003 that many people had expectations that he would follow a similar path to his dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve grown up with a sense that there&#8217;s always a preconception,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Over time, I&#8217;ve just learned to shrug it off .&#8201;.&#8201;. I just am who I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first film he directed, the 2003 drama &#8220;Spin,&#8221; starred Dana Delany, who <a href="https://twitter.com/DanaDelany/status/1318304457352830976" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered her own condolences on Twitter</a>, calling him a &#8220;special man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel lucky our paths crossed,&#8221; Delany, 64, added.</p>
<p>James&#8217; first documentary, however, was 2012&#8217;s &#8220;The Big Picture: Rethinking Dyslexia,&#8221; which was inspired by his son, Dylan. Since then he directed films about the dangers of chemical flame-retardants (2013&#8217;s &#8220;Toxic Hot Seat&#8221;), a high school&#8217;s issues with traumatized teens (2013&#8217;s &#8220;Paper Tigers&#8221;) and more. His most recent, &#8220;Playing for Keeps,&#8221; examines &#8220;the importance of play and downtime for all of us &#8212; children, adults, seniors,&#8221; <a href="https://jamesredford.com/work/playing-for-keeps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> its official description. It <a href="https://tickets.cafilm.org/websales/pages/info.aspx?evtinfo=684455~e59f7b93-5494-4bb4-b96e-6aed676b1e8e&amp;epguid=a2e58737-33e6-4346-ae14-6fe0b1238359&amp;" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">premiered earlier this month</a> at the Mill Valley Film Festival in San Rafael, Calif.</p>
<p>His wife also told the Salt Lake Tribune that at the time of his death he was finishing a documentary, &#8220;Where the Past Begins,&#8221; about &#8220;The Joy Luck Club&#8221; author Amy Tan for PBS&#8217; &#8220;American Masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>James is survived by his wife, Kyle, and their children, Dylan and Lena.</p>

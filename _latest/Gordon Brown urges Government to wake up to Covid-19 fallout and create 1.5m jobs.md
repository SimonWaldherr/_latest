 <p>     </p> <p>The AFFE wants ministers to set out a plan agreed with the devolved governments and England&#8217;s city region mayors.</p> <p>Mr Brown said: &#8220;Today we are dealing with a far bigger challenge than in the 1980s and it needs a UK-wide jobs summit bringing together the regions and nations with the Prime Minister.</p> <p>&#8220;If we do not listen to what is happening on the ground and mobilise all the resources of the UK, we will fail a generation of young people as surely as we did for too long in the 1980s.</p>

   <p>&#8220;The Prime Minister should recognise that, when all his initiatives are taken together, they simply do not meet his promise of &#8216;an opportunity generation&#8217; with help available to all.&#8221;</p> <p>Mr Brown has also backed the Mirror&#8217;s Keep Britain Working campaign.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

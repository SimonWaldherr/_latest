<div><p>The government of Pakistan has submitted a project to the World Bank seeking $200 million as a loan to strengthen digital connectivity as a key foundation for the development of digital economy, and to enhance the government&#8217;s capacity for digitally enabled public service delivery.</p>

<p>The said project will focus on critical digital infrastructure, platforms and supporting regulations for digital services. It will be financed by the loan from the International Development Association.</p>

<p>The project will be implemented in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), provincial capitals and in selected second and third tier cities where internet infrastructure will be enhanced and expanded. Focus on second and third tier cities is likely to improve students&#8217; access to online classes and also will enhance access of knowledge workers, small and medium enterprises and start-ups creating new businesses and new jobs.</p>

<p>The list of locations where the project will be implemented will be confirmed by the ministry of information technology and telecommunications in consultation with ministries of health and education and provincial governments. For now, it is unclear which second and third tier cities would be selected and so this selection would be further expanded during project preparation.</p>

<p>The project is part of the World Bank&#8217;s consolidated assistance programme to Pakistan in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing pandemic has made it apparent that without access to reliable connectivity and fast devices, millions of Pakistani citizens are being further cut off from vital information on health and safety, online learning, the opportunity to participate in a new economy, and have their voices heard, thereby emphasizing many medium-term challenges to digital transformation that need to be overcome.</p>

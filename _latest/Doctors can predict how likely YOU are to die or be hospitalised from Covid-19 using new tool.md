  Doctors can predict how likely YOU are to die or be hospitalised from Covid-19 using new tool 
description: > 
  Doctors are now able to predict how likely their patient is to die or be hospitalised from Covid-19 using a new tool.But it could also be used to encourage obese people to lose weight, to reduce their risk of Covid-19 in the future.Doctors will be able to predict how likely their patient is to die or be hospitalised from Covid-19 using a new tool.Among people diagnosed with Covid-19, over-80s are are seventy times more likely to die than those under 40, according to Public Health England data.It shows diabetes, dementia and cerebral palsy are high-risk factors for Covid-19 death.

It was tested using data from millions of patients during the first wave of the pandemic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research behind the tool was commissioned by England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty, who wants to make shielding advice more targeted to the population.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Monday the leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, suggested that a shielding programme for those most at risk is a better strategy than blanket lockdowns. He said that unlike in March, doctors are now clearly able to identify which people are most at risk of hospital admissions.&#160;&#160;</p><img id="i-a1aef8560a1402a1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="413" width="634" alt="Doctors will be able to predict how likely their patient is to die or be hospitalised from Covid-19 using a new tool.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers looked at how many had died within that period of both suspected or confirmed Covid-19, and how many days it took to be admitted to hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was then tested on 2.2million people over the first wave of the pandemic to test if it could accurately predict who would die.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Findings published in the British Medical Journal show the tool was successful in predicting most of the 2,340 deaths that occurred in the 'validation cohort'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It shows 94 per cent of people who died of Covid-19 were in the top 20 per cent for their predicted risk of death, based on the algorithm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And people in the top five per cent for predicted risk of death accounted for around 76 per cent of all the recorded Covid-19 deaths.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most common characteristics of people in this five per cent include those who are over 80 years old, are of Caribbean ethnicity, live in a care home, are underweight, have type 2 diabetes, dementia, or have had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in the past six months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall, of those who died, 57 per cent were male, 17 per cent were BAME, 83 per cent were aged over 70, 32 per cent had type 2 diabetes, and 30 per cent had dementia.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The model was between 45 per cent and 58 per cent accurate at predicting if someone will be admitted to hospital.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three quarters of the variation in risk between individuals is explained by the model, the paper said, indicating that the model is accurate at dissecting risk.

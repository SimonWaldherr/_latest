  GCHQ withheld Falklands War intelligence from US partners over fears it would be 'leaked' to Argentina, says first official history 
description: > 
  The intelligence relationship between Britain and the United States is often described as ‘special’.However, the first official history of GCHQ, published today, suggests there were tensions between the British and American signals intelligence organisations around the time of the Falklands War.In a 1985 diary entry William Odom, Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1985 to 1988, described Peter Marychurch, the head of GCHQ, as a "tense, nervous, slightly insecure civil servant”.‘He and his immediate subordinates hold, in my view, a vastly inflated view of their own competence and talents,’ the diary continued.‘They are semi- educated newspaper readers, not [intelligence] analysts worthy of national level posts.’

<p>&#8216;Socially I no longer find the British amusing, merely a pain in the ass...They didn&#8217;t have a good grasp either of current strategic affairs or history.&#160;</p>

  Mass testing and a better contact tracing programme could slash UK's R rate in HALF, SAGE says

Britain's overall R rate - the average number of people each Covid-19 patient infects - is estimated to be as high as 1.5.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">SAGE's comments suggest the R could be shrunk to at least 0.75 with the measures - but this hinges on a&#160;'well-functioning test and trace system' that catches at least 80 per cent of close contacts of infected patients within a day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Keeping the R below 1 is critical in ensuring that cases are not rising. An R above 1 means the epidemic can spiral out of control.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment, NHS Test and Trace - once hailed as 'world beating' by ministers - is still failing to find four in 10 suspected Covid-19 cases, and often doesn't reach them for at least three days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">SAGE also criticised the beleaguered programme - named to suggest it is ran by the NHS but actually controlled by the Government - for not collecting robust enough data about where clusters of infections are occurring.&#160;This makes it difficult to decide which parts of society should be shut to avoid future outbreaks, the group said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing in the paper, SAGE said: 'It is the view of [SAGE] that more and better data from the current testing system is needed...&#160;until more information on what settings people are being infected with SARS-CoV-2 in is available, modellers are unable to offer more than generic high levels principles as already produced.'&#160;</p><img id="i-484d4c8c5b796b00" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="427" width="634" alt="The

told to stay at home while the rest of society went about normal life, SAGE said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Policies to segment the population by age, relaxing restrictions for younger groups while restricting them for older groups, are likely to fail,' they advised the Government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The large amount of mixing across age groups would make it extremely

to reinfection is not known.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In cases that have begun to be reported, the time to reinfection in an individual has been relatively short.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It added: 'Therefore, this may require public understanding that once they have had Covid-19 they can be reinfected, and should seek to be tested again if they present relevant symptoms.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scientists still do not know for sure whether people can catch the virus more than once or if they become immune after their first infection.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier this week, it was revealed that a 25-year-old man in the US caught Covid for the second time, leading the University of Nevada's Dr Mark Pandori to warn that there could be 'significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It followed dozens of reports from around the world of people catching the virus twice.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it's worth noting that researchers globally admit that they are not entirely sure their patients are actually reinfected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, they say, there's a chance the virus from first infections lay dormant and become reactivated inside the

cent estimated by the WHO but is lower than Cambridge University's suggestion of 1.4 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the fatality rates varied massively by age groups. Three models by the SPI-M-O group found that the virus fatality rate did not rise above 0.1 per cent for all age groups under 40.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it surged to up to 2.3 per cent for those aged 60 to 65, about one in 50, and up to 7.2 per cent for those aged 70 and over.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have been widely varying estimates for the death rate, but experts have agreed that it stands above 0.1 per cent - which is the rate for flu and pneumonia.&#160;</p></div>

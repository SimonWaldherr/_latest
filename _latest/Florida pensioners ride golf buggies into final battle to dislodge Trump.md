Wearing “Ridin’withBiden” t-shirts and sporting Biden-Harris 2020 bumper stickers, hundreds of residents of America’s largest retirement community tootled in a convoy of golf carts to deliver their ballots.

Such a large turnout for a Democratic presidential candidate would have been unthinkable four years ago here in The Villages, a traditionally conservative suburb of 125,000 pensioners in central Florida.

“I really hadn’t expected this many, I kinda always thought it was a small club,” said 66-year-old Casey Marr, sitting beside his buggy with dog Linus wearing a Vote for Biden collar. “I think a lot of people just don’t like what they’ve seen these past six months.”

Voters from The Villages were always a key cohort in the battleground state of Florida. This week their loyalty has been pulled into the spotlight.

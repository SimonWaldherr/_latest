The promoter of the The Chainsmokers concert in the Hamptons that devolved into a crowded affair with a lack of social distancing was fined $20,000 for violating public health law, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday.

The governor said luxury services provider In The Know Experiences also violated an executive order over the July 25 bash, billed as a drive-in fundraiser, in the ritzy hamlet of Water Mill.

“As I said immediately following reports of this event, it was an egregious violation of the critical public health measures we have had in place since the beginning of this pandemic to protect New Yorkers from COVID-19,” Cuomo said in a statement.

The event was meant to have “safe zones” for cars with up to six people. But viral social media posts showed gaggles of fans leaving their cars and gathering in front of the stage without masks.

An investigation by the state health department into the concert found more than 2,150 people attended, more than allowed by the permit, which was issued by the Town of Southampton.

The promoters also neglected to include in their permit the existence of a “friends and family,” section, Cuomo said, where concertgoers could crowd together without the enforcement of mask-wearing.

Cuomo also announced Wednesday that the Town of Southampton will now need state approval to approve permits for group gatherings.

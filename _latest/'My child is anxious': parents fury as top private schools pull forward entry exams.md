  'My child is anxious': parents fury as top private schools pull forward entry exams 
description: > 
  There is nothing quite so stressful as the long countdown to exams - except when the countdown isn’t as long as you were expecting.Some of Britain’s top independent senior schools are bringing forward the date of their 11+ entrance examinations by much as much as two months to the consternation of fraught parents.Dozens of schools are also overhauling the entry process, abandoning decades of tradition and swapping written assessment papers for an online version run by the Independent Schools Examinations Board (ISEB) that removes the need for children to sit multiple exams.“You can’t complain as the schools all say you don’t need to prepare [for the ISEB common pre-tests] but we all know everyone does.It is a computer test not the handwritten one my child was expecting so requires different skills.

<div><p>There is nothing quite so stressful as the long countdown to exams - except when the countdown isn&#8217;t as long as you were expecting. Some of Britain&#8217;s top independent senior schools are bringing forward the date of their 11+ entrance examinations by much as much as two months to the consternation of fraught parents.</p>
<p>Dozens of schools are also overhauling the entry process, abandoning decades of tradition and swapping written assessment papers for an online version run by the Independent Schools Examinations Board (ISEB) that removes the need for children to sit multiple exams.&#160;</p>
<p>The abrupt changes have dismayed many parents. &#8220;It&#8217;s like training for the summer Olympics and being told with five weeks to go that they&#8217;ll be at Easter,&#8221; says the mother of one child due to sit 11+ entrance exams. &#8220;You can&#8217;t complain as the schools all say you don&#8217;t need to prepare [for the ISEB common pre-tests] but we all know everyone does. It is a computer test not the handwritten one my child was expecting so requires different skills. My child is anxious,&#8221; she adds.&#160;</p>

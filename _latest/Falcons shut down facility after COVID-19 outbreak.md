The Atlanta Falcons are the latest NFL team to have a coronavirus outbreak.

The Falcons shut down their facility Thursday after the team had positive COVID-19 test results, according to ESPN.com. The report stated that there were four positive tests, however, as of now the team has only confirmed one other positive from a non-player, NFL.com reported. The team is working remotely on Thursday as a precaution. Atlanta put defensive tackle Marlon Davidson on the reserve/COVID-19 list on Wednesday.

Sunday’s NFL Week 6 Falcons-Vikings game remains scheduled for 1 p.m., the NFL said.

In the past few weeks, the Titans had one positive coronavirus test balloon into a total of 24 cases. The Titans’ 42-16 win over the Bills was rescheduled from Sunday to Tuesday this past week, with several Tennessee players remaining on the COVID-19/reserve list. The Panthers, who beat the Falcons on Sunday, entered the NFL’s intensive COVID-19 protocol.

The Patriots activated quarterback Cam Newton, who tested positive on Oct. 2, from the NFL’s COVID-19/reserve list Wednesday. The Patriots had their game against the Broncos pushed back a week after two more positive tests. Three Patriots remain on the COVID-19/reserve list: cornerback Stephon Gilmore, defensive tackle Byron Cowart and practice squad DT Bill Murray.

The Falcons news comes one day after the league announced that it would be cancelling the 2021 Pro Bowl game, which was slated to be played in Las Vegas on Jan. 31, due to the pandemic.

The Falcons fired coach Dan Quinn this week after an 0-5 start to the season.

From the four iPhones that were announced by Apple, it’s the iPhone 12 mini that is the one I’m most excited about. No, I’m not going to buy it. iPhones are simply out of my budget and I have a liking for Android. But I what I hope is that Apple’s design choices rub off on other smartphone manufacturers.

During the event, Apple started talking about the iPhone 12 and went on in great detail to explain its features and then simply rounded up the announcement by saying that the same phone would be available in a smaller “mini” size. No compromises in hardware. The same phone, in a more pocketable size.

Now I’m aware that not all of you will agree to this but smartphones are getting unwieldy and it’s time we ask for smartphones that are more…...mobile. Sure I’ve enjoyed big-screen smartphones and I know they’re quite popular amongst the crowd too. But at the same time, there’s a segment of the crowd that just doesn’t have either the capacity to or the want to own such huge bricks.

The strong sales of the iPhone SE 2020 - a phone with a 4.7-inch display - shows that there are consumers out there who don’t want hefty smartphones. This is why the iPhone 12 mini really excites me because despite boasting a smaller factor and being lighter than the SE 2020, it has a bigger 5.4-inch display and better battery expectancy (2 hours more according to Apple). The criticism for including chonky bezels is something that also doesn’t hold valid for the iPhone 12 mini.

Did I mention that the iPhone 12 mini weighs only 133 grams?

I know quite a few people who are still sticking to their older phones (especially iPhone users) as they find the new ones to be simply too big - and they are! Smartphones, even in the budget segment, weight as much as 200 grams and include sizeable 6.4-inch displays. My colleague, who is really careful with his gadgets, recently dropped a mid-ranger just because of how hulking it was.

As mentioned before, these smartphones are usually more enjoyable to watch media on and also have larger batteries that are desirable. But at the same time, there exists a crowd which doesn’t solely rely on their smartphones for media consumption and hence don’t necessarily need huge displays on their smartphones.

Even if we keep aside this fraction of people, there are people out there who simply find it uncomfortable to use huge phones just because of how smol their hands are. There’s really nothing they can do about that and quite a few end up using these phones as some of us would use tablets - by doing hand gymnastics.

This is one time when I’d really like more smartphone OEMs to get “inspired” from what Apple is doing, with its smallest iPhone. Not all of us have Lebron James-sized hands and it’d really help if smaller phones were delivered without any compromises. And thanks to rapid improvements in technology, smaller phones can still pack bigger screens and equally powerful hardware if not more.

It’s not like what we didn’t have compact flagships back then. Sony’s flagship Xperia Z series always offered a compact, uncompromised version of their flagship. While Sony is still making compact phones, their presence isn’t of much impact in the smartphone market right now. Long story short, compact Android flagships just don’t exist and it’d be great if smartphone manufacturers could take a leaf out of Apple’s book and deliver more pocketable smartphones.

Again, I’m not saying that all phones need to be small. But maintaining one compact SKU in a massive portfolio shouldn’t be a big deal for most smartphone companies, right?

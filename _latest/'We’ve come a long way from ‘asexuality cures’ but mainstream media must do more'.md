  'We’ve come a long way from ‘asexuality cures’ but mainstream media must do more' 
description: > 
  By Federica La Marca // BBC The Social Contributor // 21 October 2020Within this article, I will sometimes use the shorthand “ace” when referring to the term asexual.Ace is how many members of the community describe themselves.Allosexual, on the other hand, is the word used to refer to non-ace people of any sexuality.Although asexuality has been recognised as a sexual orientation since the 1970s, its representation in the mainstream media has always been lacking.

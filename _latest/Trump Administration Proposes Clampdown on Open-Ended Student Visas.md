  Trump Administration Proposes Clampdown on Open-Ended Student Visas 
description: > 
  The Department of Homeland Security is proposing to add a fixed end-date to student visas when they are issued, departing from its current practice of allowing them to remain valid as long as an international student is in school.The proposal, which the department posted in the Federal Register on Thursday, would set most visas to expire after four years—even if a student is enrolled in a longer graduate program or needs extra time to finish a degree—and would limit student visas to two years for students born in several dozen Middle Eastern, Asian and African countries.The department’s communication cites as an example one student who has remained in the U.S. on a student visa since 1991 to attend a dance school.It doesn’t specify how many students have used student visas in similar ways.Under the proposed regulation, anyone wishing to stay longer would have to either seek an extension or reapply for a new visa.

<div><p>The Department of Homeland Security is proposing to add a fixed end-date to student visas when they are issued,&#160;departing from its current practice of allowing them to remain valid as long as an international student is in school.</p>
         <p>The proposal, which the department posted in the Federal Register&#160;on Thursday, would set most visas to expire after four years&#8212;even if a student is enrolled in a longer graduate program or needs extra time to finish a degree&#8212;and would limit student visas to two years for students born in several dozen Middle Eastern, Asian and African countries.</p>
         <p>The policy is necessary, the Trump administration argues, because under the status quo students can remain in the U.S. as long as they have documents showing that&#160;they are continuing to study toward their degree, an undetermined length of time that it says poses national security risks.</p>
         <p>The department&#8217;s communication&#160;cites as an example one student who has remained in the U.S. on a student visa since 1991 to attend a dance school. It doesn&#8217;t specify how many students have used student visas in similar ways.&#160;</p>

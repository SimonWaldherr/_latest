  Unicef unveils plan to stockpile half a billion vaccine syringes by Christmas 
description: > 
  Unicef has unveiled plans to stockpile more than half a billion syringes by Christmas, amid concerns that shortages could delay the rollout of successful Covid-19 vaccines.The United Nations agency announced on Monday that it aims to have 520 million syringes stored in its warehouses across the globe by the end of the year.By contrast syringes, which are bulky and have a shelf life of five years, generally travel via a far slower route: sea freight.By the end of the year, we will already have over half a billion syringes pre-positioned where they can be deployed quickly and cost effectively.“That’s enough syringes to wrap around the world one and a half times,” she added.

<div><p>Unicef has unveiled plans to stockpile more than half a billion syringes by Christmas, amid concerns that shortages could delay the rollout of successful Covid-19 vaccines.&#160;</p>
<p>The United Nations agency announced on Monday that it aims to have 520 million syringes stored in its warehouses across the globe by the end of the year. The aim is to ensure that the injection equipment arrives in countries before any potential coronavirus jab.&#160;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/boost-oxford-covid-vaccine-emerges-rivals-must-deep-frozen/">vaccines are temperature sensitive</a>, they tend to be rapidly transported across the globe via air. By contrast syringes, which are bulky and have a shelf life of five years, generally travel via a far slower route: sea freight.&#160;</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-vaccine-unlikely-2022-says-leading-figure/">growing concerns</a> that this could result in a situation where countries have vaccine doses available, but no equipment to administer them.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccinating the world against Covid-19 will be one of the largest mass undertakings in human history, and we will need to move as quickly as the vaccines can be produced,&#8221; said Henrietta Fore, executive director of Unicef.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to move fast later, we must move fast now. By the end of the year, we will already have over half a billion syringes pre-positioned where they can be deployed quickly and cost effectively.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough syringes to wrap around the world one and a half times,&#8221; she added.&#160;</p>

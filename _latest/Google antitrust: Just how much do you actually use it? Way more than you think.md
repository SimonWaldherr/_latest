<div><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google's influence in our lives is overwhelming, which is perhaps one of the reasons the Department of Justice and several state attorney generals banded together to file an anti-trust lawsuit against the company.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But just how wide is Google's reach? We decided to take a look, and the results may surprise you.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Start with the fact that Google ads are all over the Internet, and despite the initial stated goal of "organizing the world's information," the Alphabet unit is designed to have more ads appear, to keep the earnings up. In its most recent earnings, Alphabet reported $38.30&#160;billion for Google. Most of that comes from its top division:</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Google home page"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Update:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/10/20/google-face-antitrust-case-filed-justice-department/5989179002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Justice Dept. files landmark antitrust case against Google</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">More:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/10/19/googles-nest-hub-more-personalized-recommendations/3685209001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Google's Nest Hub video displays offering more recommendations</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google in search</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google search is far and away the most used of any search engine, either at Google.com, or on mobile devices, where it's the default search option on iOS and Android phones, with 88% share, per the DOJ suit. It's so intertwined in the fabric of our culture that people say they "Google" something when they mean they're searching&#160;for&#160;it. Additionally, its Google Assistant explores voice search to take on Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri and is baked into its phones, its devices and those from partners. In traditional text search, alternatives are few. There's Microsoft's Bing, Yahoo (which is powered by Bing) and DuckDuckGo, which differs from the main players in that it offers private search without tracker blocking.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-tech-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google in browsers</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Most people use Google Chrome's browser on their computers, even though it heavily tracks us and has been called a privacy security "nightmare," by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/sep/04/googlechromeprivacyissuesa" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Guardian</a>. Alternatives are many: Mozilla's Firefox is the DuckDuckGo of browsers, saying it specializes in "private browsing." Other browsers include Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Edge. DOJ says Chrome has a 60% market share, to 16% for Safari, 15% for Microsoft's Edge and Internet Explorer and 7% for Firefox.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-tech-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google's operating system: Android</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While in the United States, 60% of us use the iPhone, according to the DOJ lawsuit, worldwide the Android system, which is owned by Google, has an 86% market share, <a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">per IDC</a>. Android phones (from players like Samsung and its Galaxy line, LG and OnePlus) spotlight Google search and the many apps in its eco-system. Alternatives: Bing, Yahoo and the DuckDuckGo search apps.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google's apps</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google dominates navigation with the Maps and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/09/15/traffic-waze-new-features/5793425002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Waze</a> apps, foreign translation (Google Translate), photo backup and sharing (Google Photos), writing/spreadsheets (Google Docs), and online storage (Google Drive).&#160;Alternatives are many: Apple Maps, Apple Translate and other translation apps, Amazon Photos, Microsoft Word and Excel, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive and Apple's iCloud.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google in online video</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The No. 2 search engine, after Google, is actually YouTube, which dominates video viewing, on computers, mobile phones and on streaming TV. Alternatives to a pure video app are rare, but online video is also huge on Facebook and Twitter.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google in social media</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is one area where Google doesn't have a hand. Its Google Plus service was a huge flop, even though Google did everything its power to hook people, by demanding that all Google accounts had to go through Google Plus first. Facebook owns the social space, but YouTube is also considered a social network, with community pages that rely on comments, Stories and posts.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google in productivity apps</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Many people set their schedules on Google Calendar, which is tied into the most used e-mail program, Gmail. Google sifts through the e-mails and inserts appointments found from their directly onto the calendar. Alternatives: Apple and Samsung's digital calendars, free e-mail from Apple, Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo and another of smaller&#160;</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google in devices</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Beyond the Android phones from Samsung, LG, Motorola and others, which are mostly powered by Google software, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/09/30/google-unveils-new-pixel-chromecast-and-nest-event/5868455002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Google also makes it own line of phones, the Pixel. </a>The Pixel 4A, which was released in the summer, is among the lowest priced, full featured phone from a major manufacturer, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/09/29/samsung-lg-tcl-and-motorola-have-good-phones-under-300/3536768001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">at $349</a>. Google also owns the Nest division, which makes thermostats and video doorbells, and has a line of smart speakers to take on Amazon's Echo speakers and displays, at first called Google Home, and now known as Nest Audio, or Nest Hub. Alternatives: smart speakers from Amazon and Apple, doorbells from Amazon's Ring division and displays from Amazon and Facebook (Portal).</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-tech-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google in schools</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The lowest-priced computers available are from <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/09/16/virtual-school-families-paying-more-chromebook-desk-bluetooth-headphones/5810336002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Google's Chromebook </a>division, which gained an overwhelming market share by flooding school districts with $200 computers that were prohibited from downloading apps not available in the Google Play Store. The computers had little storage but instead were targeted to be online-only devices. Alternatives include full-service Windows computers from Dell, Lenovo and Microsoft, or Apple computers.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Google in TV viewing</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The cutting-the-cord movement saw a new type of video streaming service, the cable alternative, which offered fewer channels, lower rates and no equipment rental fees. Players include Sling TV, Hulu with Live TV and Google's YouTube TV. Sling is the cheapest, at $35 monthly, while <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/07/07/youtube-tv-philo-lowest-priced-cable-tv-alternative-streaming/5385663002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">YouTube is the most expensive at $65 monthly</a>. YouTube had initially charged $35 monthly when it launched in 2017.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">And Google in&#160;TV</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google offers the Android system for TV manufacturers in a smart TV setting and is used by Sony and Sharp, among others to provide a smart TV menu for viewers hooked to the internet. Google just changed the Android TV name to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/10/01/googles-chromecast-no-longer-niche-product-and-ready-prime-time/3589736001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Google TV</a> and also debuted it on the new Chromecast streaming device. Chromecast competes with Amazon's Fire TV streaming stick and similar streaming players from Roku, as well as the Apple TV set-top box.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter</p></div>

<div><p>2021 is still a few months away but we already have a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s30-leaked-full-january-2021-launch-confimed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a>, from <i>Android Central</i>, which tells us that the Galaxy S21 (or Galaxy S30) series could arrive in January 2021. If true, this might be the earliest that Samsung has held an event for a Galaxy S series phone. And yes, <a href="https://app.voice.com/post/@onleaks/this-is-the-samsung-galaxy-s21-1603010524-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaked renders </a>of the phone have also surfaced on the web.</p>

<p>The renders have been <a href="https://app.voice.com/post/@onleaks/this-is-the-samsung-galaxy-s21-1603010524-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaked </a>by reliable leaker <i>Steve Hemmerstoffer </i>(aka @OnLeaks) who says that the Galaxy S21 series will include three different models: Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus and the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Besides, Steve corroborates <i>Android Central&#8217;s</i> report that the phones will launch earlier than usual, this time around.</p>

<p>Launching earlier than usual is definitely a bit unusual. If anything, the pandemic has delayed operations and launches of companies around the world. Apple too, who usually launches the new iPhones in September, released their phones a month later. But since the earlier-than-usual launch date is only a speculation at the moment, we&#8217;ll wait for supporting information in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Coming back to the renders, it seems like Samsung is changing the design language of its camera module yet again. Instead of housing the cameras in an &#8220;independent&#8221; rectangle, the S21&#8217;s camera module now melts into the edges at the top and left. This does look rather interesting.</p>

<p>The S21 is expected to boast a flat 6.2-inch panel whereas the S21 Ultra will have a larger, curbed 6.7-6.9-inch display. Another difference between the S21 and the S21 Ultra is the number of cameras on the back. While the S21 is expected to have a triple-camera setup, the S21 Ultra seems to boast of a quad-camera setup.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know much else about the upcoming phones. But if the launch indeed happens in January next year, we can expect to hear more about the devices earlier than usual - probably by as early as next mont</p>

<div><p>Residents of the massive cleanup zone surrounding the shuttered Exide battery recycling plant in Vernon marched to downtown Los Angeles on Monday evening to protest <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-16/exide-bankrtuptcy-decision-vernon-cleanup" target="_blank">a bankruptcy court&#8217;s decision</a> to allow the company to abandon the heavily contaminated site.</p><p>Some brought plastic bags of dirt from lead-polluted yards, throwing them over a fence onto the steps of the federal courthouse at North Main and West Temple streets.</p><p>&#8220;These are donations from the Exide-impacted area,&#8221; said Mark Lopez, co-director of <a class="link" href="http://eycej.org/" target="_blank">East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice</a>, which organized the protest.</p><p>The demonstration drew about 150 people, many of them from southeast Los Angeles County communities riddled with lead contamination from decades of air pollution from the closed Exide Technologies facility.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>&#8220;East L.A. under attack. What do we do? Stand up, fight back,&#8221; the crowd chanted as they marched down 1st Street from Mariachi Plaza in Boyle Heights, beating drums and holding signs demanding accountability for the pollution.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice supported Exide&#8217;s bankruptcy plan, approved Friday by a Delaware bankruptcy court, which allows the company to walk away from its half-demolished facility and leave the expensive toxic cleanup to California taxpayers. The judge concluded that the site is not an imminent threat to the public.</p><p>The decision infuriated Guadalupe Valdovinos, 35, whose home in East L.A. is sandwiched between two neighboring properties that have not been cleaned. She attended the protest with her 11-year-old daughter and brought a small bag of soil from her neighbor&#8217;s yard, where high lead levels were detected.</p><p>&#8220;Why is it OK for us to live in poison?&#8221; Valdovinos said. &#8220;To me, that&#8217;s an imminent threat. But we just don&#8217;t matter. We&#8217;re collateral damage.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Protesters projected a skull-and-crossbones symbol onto the side of the federal court building as they took turns sharing stories about the effects of lead pollution on their health and communities. Others left signs: &#8220;Criminalize polluters&#8221; and &#8220;Dirt bags for dirtbags.&#8221;</p><p>State and local officials, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, have blasted the bankruptcy court ruling. The state Department of Toxic Substances Control is appealing the decision and has filed a motion for a stay of the ruling.</p><p>Protesters also excoriated state regulators who allowed the Vernon plant, which melted down used car batteries, <a class="link" href="https://timelines.latimes.com/exide-technologies-history/" target="_blank">to operate for decades</a> without a full permit, despite repeated violations of air pollution limits and hazardous waste laws. Exide agreed to close the plant permanently in 2015 in a deal with federal prosecutors to avoid criminal prosecution for years of illegal activity.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

  When is it ever OK to talk at gigs?

<p>&#8220;Someone has put a dedicated amount of hours into creating not only the song, but performing it live. OK, if it&#8217;s a heavy metal gig and it&#8217;s a bit louder, the chatter perhaps maybe wouldn&#8217;t be as noticeable. But, if you&#8217;re at someone like James Bay&#8217;s gig, who is going to have those stripped back moments of just him and the acoustic guitar, it makes me crawl inside [when people talk]. I feel so bad for the artist.</p>

                            <p>"If you&#8217;re talking about the gig, the moment, and discussing &#8216;Wow, that was amazing&#8217;, and you&#8217;re with everyone else in that room, then someone may want to join in the conversation with you and show their appreciation.</p>
                    <p>&#8220;But if you're there at a James Bay gig, talking about the fact you&#8217;ve got so much work to do and it&#8217;s Friday tomorrow and you can&#8217;t be bothered to go in, then go to the pub mate. Just get yourself to the pub! Why are you even there in the first place? You&#8217;re obviously not enjoying yourself because you&#8217;re talking about work or something else.&#8221;</p>

description: > 
  And yet, he emerged as the star of the show for United on a night littered with positives from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.PSG expect to dominate the domestic game in France and so the true measuring stick will be the Champions League.If defeat by United is nothing more than a bump in the road, he has nothing to worry about.And yet here was Wythenshawe's own Rashford proving he - not Neymar or Mbappe - is the striker built for the biggest moments.If his performance against United is anything to go by, Neymar and PSG are going nowhere fast.

Verratti in his midfield.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Tuchel looked down his bench it was flooded with youth and inexperience, far from ideal with the game in the balance against an impressive United side.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He saw&#160;Kays Ruiz-Atil (18), Timothee Pembele (18), Bandiougou Fadiga (19),&#160;Mitchel Bakker (20), Moise Kean (20) and Colin Dagba (22).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In contrast United were able to turn to Paul Pogba, Donny van de Beek, Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata and Odion Ighalo, depth with plenty of experience.</p><p

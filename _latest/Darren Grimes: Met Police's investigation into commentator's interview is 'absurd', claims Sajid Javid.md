The Metropolitan Police's investigation into an interview published by Darren Grimes is "plainly absurd" and should be withdrawn, Sajid Javid has claimed.

The former Chancellor said the conservative commentator should not be persecuted for the comments made by historian David Starkey, who said slavery was not genocide because there are "so many damn blacks".

Mr Grimes was asked to attend a police station to be interviewed under caution, accused of a public order offence of stirring up racial hatred by publishing the interview on his podcast on July 2.

Responding, Mr Javid wrote on Twitter: "David Starkey’s comments were appalling. But, the idea that it’s appropriate to go after journalists for the remarks of their interviewees is plainly absurd.

"For the sake of our cherished free press, I hope the Metropolitan Police reconsider".

The former Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron previously condemned the police for their investigation into Mr Grimes, calling it "ridiculous".

He wrote on Twitter: "There might be more than meets the eye here, but on the face of it this is completely ridiculous. Grimes is not responsible for Starkey’s appalling comments. In a free society, we surely don’t do things like this?"

  Princess Diana insisted she was not coerced into bombshell Panorama interview, BBC claims

  “I spoke to people who were very very close to the Princess of Wales who said they had discussed these bank statements in October 1995 and they discussed with Diana the importance of these documents and they discussed with Diana whether or not she should give an interview,” he said.“It all makes sense when you realise that she lived in a world of anxiety and possible surveillance and that Martin Bashir very cleverly, in a very sophisticated way, played on that.In a statement, the BBC said: “The BBC's internal records from the time indicate that Martin had met the Princess of Wales before the mocked-up documentation existed.These accounts also say that the Princess of Wales confirmed in writing that these documents played no part in her decision to give the interview.”A spokeswoman added: “The BBC itself no longer possesses a physical copy of this note.The first version of that interview, which was never broadcast, did not reference his infidelity but he was persuaded to do a second take, it is claimed.

<div><p>&#8220;I spoke to people who were very very close to the Princess of Wales who said they had discussed these bank statements in October 1995 and they discussed with Diana the importance of these documents and they discussed with Diana whether or not she should give an interview,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all makes sense when you realise that she lived in a world of anxiety and possible surveillance and that Martin Bashir very cleverly, in a very sophisticated way, played on that.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking to those in Diana&#8217;s circle at that time you can get a sense of why those bank statements were a tipping point that made her mind up to sit down at Kensington Palace and speak about her life to Martin Bashir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Jephson, the Princess&#8217;s private secretary, accused the BBC of &#8220;seduction and betrayal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet a critical note said to have been written by Princess Diana insisting that she was not misled and that the documents played no part in her decision to give the interview, has disappeared.</p>
<p>In a statement, the BBC said: &#8220;The BBC's internal records from the time indicate that Martin had met the Princess of Wales before the mocked-up documentation existed. These accounts also say that the Princess of Wales confirmed in writing that these documents played no part in her decision to give the interview.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman added: &#8220;The BBC itself no longer possesses a physical copy of this note. But its existence is documented in the BBC&#8217;s records, and it was seen, at the time, by BBC management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Morton described such a turn of events as &#8220;astonishing.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;If they received a letter saying the Princess of Wales herself was very happy about the way that the programme was made, that would bombproof them against any future concerns.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The documentary reveals that another catalyst for the interview, Prince Charles&#8217;s revelation to Jonathan Dimbleby the previous year that he had committed adultery, had almost never been made.&#160;</p>
<p>The first version of that interview, which was never broadcast, did not reference his infidelity but he was persuaded to do a second take, it is claimed.</p>
<p>Three months before recording the Panorama interview, the Princess had met Sir Max Hastings, then editor of the Daily Telegraph, telling him that her marriage was &#8220;hell from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he said: &#8220;I felt that my job was to try and help them keep the lid on the worst of this, rather than to lift it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diana: The Truth Behind The Interview will be broadcast on Channel 4 on October 21 at 9pm</p>

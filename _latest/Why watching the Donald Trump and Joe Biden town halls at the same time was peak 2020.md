The dueling town halls with President Donald Trump and Joe Biden Thursday night were chaotic and bizarre and couldn’t have been more different.

In other words, they served as a perfect representation of the 2020 election. Watching them both simultaneously might have been the ultimate expression of trying to keep up with a never-ending, ever-changing cycle of stories.

So that’s what I did.

What a thing. If the town halls were “It’s a Wonderful Life,” Biden’s was Bedford Falls and Trump’s was Pottersville.

“This is not how things were supposed to be,” NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, who hosted the Trump town hall (and was outstanding), said at the outset.

You don’t say.

NBC made a stupid decision agreeing to the competing Trump town hall

The second presidential debate was supposed to be Thursday. It was canceled when Trump tested positive for COVID-19 and then refused to participate in a virtual debate. So Biden agreed to a 90-minute town hall on ABC hosted by George Stephanopoulos.

Then NBC scheduled a 60-minute Trump town hall directly opposite Biden’s. It was a stupid decision that made the network look bad, particularly when Trump started trashing NBC on Twitter earlier in the day.

But credit where it’s due: Guthrie made the most of her ill-gotten opportunity.

She pressed Trump for answers from the outset, demanded follow-ups and called him out when needed. For instance, when Trump tried to defend the unhinged conspiracy theory that Joe Biden was behind killing SEAL Team 6 in order to cover up the faking of Osama Bin Laden’s death — Trump retweeted it — Guthrie wasn’t having it.

“That was a retweet, that was an opinion of somebody, and that was a retweet,” Trump said, by way of explanation. “I’ll put it out there, people can decide for themselves, I don’t take a position.”

“I don’t get that," Guthrie said. “You’re the president — you’re not like someone’s crazy uncle who can just retweet whatever.”

How the NBC and ABC town halls compared

And when Trump claimed not to know about QAnon, Guthrie said, “You do know!” Later she called him out on spreading false claims of voter fraud, saying he was “sowing doubt in our democracy.”

In other words she held his feet to the fire and he clearly didn’t like it. She did a terrific job.

Meanwhile, over on ABC, the vibe — and volume — made it feel like visiting a different planet, or at least era. Stephanopoulos and members of the audience asked Biden questions and he answered them.

And?

That’s it. The tone was conversational, quiet — normal, you might say.

When did normal start feeling so strange?

That’s a theoretical question. We know the answer: when the media realized Trump was good for ratings.

The presidential election is not a reality competition show. And yet

That’s what this boiled down to, after all — less than three weeks away from a presidential election an important chance to hear from the candidates turned into a competing reality competition show. If Trump’s town hall scores higher ratings — and it will, because NBC has more networks to show it on, plus don’t discount the what-will-he-say curiosity factor — we’ll be listening to his bragging for the rest of the campaign.

Should Biden score bigger ratings, we can look forward to several days of claims that ABC fed him the questions, he read off of a teleprompter, he had an earpiece — did I leave any looney theories out?

This isn’t to say Biden had it easy. Stephanopoulos pushed him for an answer on court packing. Biden didn’t want to answer, but did say voters would know his stance before the election.

Late in Trump’s event, a woman named Paulette Dale stood to ask a question about DACA. But first she said, “Good evening Mr. President. I have to say, you have a wonderful smile.” Trump thanked her.

“He does,” Dale said. “You’re so handsome when you smile.”

Just when you think it can’t get weirder. On that front, the 2020 election never disappoints.

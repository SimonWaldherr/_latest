Prosecutors at the Southern District of New York allege the heiress committed perjury during her testimony by claiming she had no knowledge of the abuse, charges she denies.

The depositions are Ms Maxwell’s only on-the-record account of her association with Epstein and his sex-trafficking ring. Her lawyers argue it was given under an expectation of confidentiality that had been agreed to by both sides in the dispute.

Parts of it were unsealed by a judge last year and another tranche was made public in July.

David Boies, attorney for Ms Giuffre, argued in court on Tuesday that it was "unfair" that only selective portions of the documents had been unsealed.

"People reading it don't have the entire context," he said, arguing that the reputation of Ms Giuffre, who sued Maxwell for defamation after she claimed she was lying about her abuse, was at stake. "It will prejudice our client if the public is given a misleading view," he added.

Judge Rosemary Pooler, praising reporting by the Miami Herald that led to Maxwell's arrest, said that it "led to some important work in the protection of young female victims but Miss Maxwell may be a victim as well, isn't that true?"

She questioned why the remainder of the evidence needed to be made public if Ms Giuffre’s lawsuit had already been settled, particularly as she had upcoming criminal trial.

Christine Walz, a lawyer for the newspaper, which is an intervener in the case, said she disagreed with the characterisation, but added it was irrelevant to whether the documents should be released.

Transcripts were designated “confidential” and subject to a protective order, however, they came to be in the hands of the US government.

Maxwell’s lawyers have tried to claim that the trove of documents - which could expose fresh details about her sex life as well as her relation to powerful figures accused of taking part in the abuse of the late billionaire's victims - would result in “substantial negative media publicity and speculation in an internet world."

The Second US Circuit Court of Appeals will decide either to confirm their unsealing or reject the ruling by US District Judge Loretta Preska.

The two &#8220;continued to narrow their differences,&#8221; said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi. He added that &#8220;the speaker continues to hope that, by the end of the day Tuesday, we will have clarity on whether we will be able to pass a bill before the election.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The odds of a last-minute deal remain long, with Democrats and the Trump administration still haggling over funding levels and policy issues. Even if they could agree, Senate Republicans have all but ruled out embracing a plan anywhere near as large as the more than $2 trillion package under discussion.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">If such a deal were struck, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the chamber would consider it, but he also made a point of scheduling two separate votes in the coming days on narrower bills of the kind senators in his party are more willing to accept. One would revive a lapsed federal loan program for small businesses and the other would provide $500 billion for schools, testing and expired unemployment benefits.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump has insisted in recent days that he wants to spend more than the $2.4 trillion Ms. Pelosi has put forward in negotiations, and claimed he could easily cajole enough Senate Republicans into supporting an agreement of that size &#8212; a notion that many of them have told his top deputies would never happen.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a private call with Democrats on Monday, Ms. Pelosi outlined a number of remaining areas of disagreement, including Democratic demands for hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for state and local governments, support for restaurants devastated by the pandemic and additional health provisions, according to a person on the call, who disclosed the details on condition of anonymity. Democrats also remain wary that the administration would spend the funds as Congress intended.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Ms. Pelosi insisted she was optimistic a bargain could be reached and said she was intent on reaching one before a new Democratic administration began in January.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to carry over the droppings of this grotesque elephant into the next presidency,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi told her members. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get something big, and we&#8217;ve got to get it done soon and we&#8217;ve got to get it done right.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="us-stock-futures-rise-as-a-deadline-for-a-stimulus-deal-arrives"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#us-stock-futures-rise-as-a-deadline-for-a-stimulus-deal-arrives">U.S. stock futures rise as a deadline for a stimulus deal arrives.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="People walk by the New York Stock Exchange in lower Manhattan." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/business/20markets/merlin_177952182_1f4210e8-7db6-4de5-ace3-77901e73ba32-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">People walk by the New York Stock Exchange in lower Manhattan.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Spencer Platt/Getty Images</p></p></p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">U.S. stock futures indicated a gain on Wall Street when trading begins on Tuesday, the day Speaker Nancy Pelosi has set as a deadline for reaching an agreement with Republicans on an economic stimulus package.

The regulator <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/34-90208.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imposed a fine</a> over a stock buyback by the energy company Andeavor, introducing an unexpected accounting wrinkle to the repurchase process that experts say companies have probably not considered before.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Late in negotiations to sell itself to Marathon Petroleum in 2018, Andeavor announced a $250 million buyback, repurchasing 2.6 million shares at an average price of $97 each. Shortly afterward, Andeavor announced a deal with Marathon that valued its stock at more than $150 per share.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The S.E.C. punished the move by applying an accounting rule in an unforeseen way. The regulator found that the buyback was initiated when Andeavor had material nonpublic information that wasn&#8217;t disclosed to shareholders. But instead of charging the company or executives with fraud or insider trading, it &#8220;zeroed in on the company&#8217;s accounting controls, and found them inadequate to ensure compliance&#8221; with Andeavor&#8217;s own rules about buybacks, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://alerts.davispolk.com/10/5295/uploads/stock-buybacks-under-10b5-1-plan-draw-sec-rebuke.pdf?sid=22201c60-f050-4e5e-b14e-bebe33c5dff2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to lawyers at Davis Polk</a>. Andeavor admitted no wrongdoing and agreed to pay a $20 million penalty.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Buybacks were already under increased political and regulatory scrutiny. Now, there is a new accounting twist, adding extra concerns over internal controls. &#8220;The process of approving a buyback now seems more complicated than it was a day before the case came out,&#8221; said Robert Cohen, a partner at Davis Polk and a former S.E.C. enforcement lawyer.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="in-one-montana-town-mask-rules-vary-by-the-business"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#in-one-montana-town-mask-rules-vary-by-the-business">In one Montana town, mask rules vary by the business.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Randy Lint, owner of Big Creek Coffee Roasters in Hamilton, Mont., requires customers to wear a mask.

But the commissioners in Ravalli County, in southwestern Montana, opted not to enforce the order, citing individual rights. That decision put the business owners of Hamilton, a town of about 5,000, in the tricky position of creating their own policies &#8212; an especially difficult proposition in an area of the country that, until recently, was slow to see the spread of the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Some businesses don&#8217;t require the face coverings, though others do. One owner, who runs a coffee shop, requires face coverings of employees but not customers &#8212; and some of her workers have been openly criticized while taking orders.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The businesses want safety for workers, but don&#8217;t want to alienate customers, either &#8212; especially when every one of them is needed to stay afloat.

In September, Disney <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/disney-theme-park-workers-layoffs.html" title="">said it planned</a> to cut nearly 30,000 jobs, most of them from its theme parks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Despite pleas from the company, Governor Newsom has been skeptical of reopening. &#8220;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/202010/7777/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">We&#8217;re going to be stubborn about it</a>,&#8221; he said this month.<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>&#8220;We feel there&#8217;s no hurry putting out guidelines.&#8221; Last week <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/california-state-officials-visit-disneyland-universal-studios-hollywood-amid-reopening-consideration" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he dispatched</a> a team of state officials to inspect the resort.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/noam-scheiber" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p></div>

description: > 
  The Manchester mum, who asked not to be named, says the noisy neighbour has been a problem since lockdown began back in March.She says the woman next door is making her life miserable for her family, including three young children, aged four, two and one, with loud sex and arguments nightly."I spoke to them regarding the sex noise again and they said there's nothing they can do because it's a natural noise," the mum said.After the MEN contacted Manchester Council for comment, officials visited to investigate the noise complaint at around 1.20am last Saturday.It is understood there is no dispute that loud sex could constitute a legitimate noise complaint if the necessary evidence is gathered.

<p>It is understood there is no dispute that loud sex could constitute a legitimate noise complaint if the necessary evidence is gathered.</p> <p>Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Noise Act 1996, the legislation states that the noise which is the cause of the complaint must be (or is likely to be) "either detrimental to a person&#8217;s health and/or it is interfering (or is likely to interfere) with a person&#8217;s own enjoyment of their own property and land".</p> <p>If an Environmental Health officer agrees the noise represents a "statutory nuisance", they can issue an abatement notice and take action through the courts if necessary.</p> <p>Councillor Rabnawaz Akbar, Manchester City Council Executive Member for Neighbourhoods, said: "Manchester City Council officers attended a property in response to a call on Saturday 17 October, as there had been reports of loud noise from the property.</p> <p>"The officer who attended the property at 01.20am said no noise could be heard.&#160;&#160;</p> <p>"Wherever possible, for the safety of residents and staff, at the current time, officers are assessing noise from street level rather than entering properties to make an assessment of whether noise constitutes a nuisance.&#8221;</p></div>

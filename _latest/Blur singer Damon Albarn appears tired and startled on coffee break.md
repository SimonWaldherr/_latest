  Blur singer Damon Albarn appears tired and startled on coffee break 
description: > 
  Blur frontman and Gorillaz star Damon Albarn made a rare outing on Wednesday when he stopped for a coffee break outdoors in London with a friend.The 52-year-old Britpop icon appeared tired and startled when he sat down for a brew and some eggs.Clearly obeying Tier 2 restrictions, Damon made sure to dine outside with his friend as per the new rules amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Back in April, Oasis star Noel Gallagher claimed the feud between his band and Blur was due to Damon sleeping with a woman Liam Gallagher was dating at the time.Neither Noel or Alan named the woman in question, however fans may speculate it could be Liam's ex Lisa Moorish.

Donald Trump ignored multiple polls showing him losing Pennsylvania to former Vice President Joe Biden as he said he cannot “imagine losing to a guy like this?”

“They say he was born in Scranton, but he abandoned you,” the president told a rally crowd in Johnstown even though Mr Biden’s parents moved the family when he was a child. “Give me a break.”

The 74-year-old Mr Trump continued to paint the 77-year-old Mr Biden as too old and too senile to be president, contending he forgot on Monday in what city he was campaigning.

“I’m running against the single-worst candidate in the history of American politics,” he said as the large crowd chuckled in unison. “Can you imagine if you lose to a guy like this?”

In a new attack line, Mr Trump called his rival “a bad guy." And in a shorter version of an old one, he called Mr Biden “a dummy.”

And he tried to tie Mr Biden to the most progressive wing of his party, saying the liberal bloc wants to “shame you” and “cancel you.”

Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists and marxists and left wing extremists, like his Vice Presidential candidate.”

On his own coronavirus infection, the president said the experimental cocktail of antibody drugs and powerful steroids he got without noting it is not available to the over 7m Americans who have contracted the virus, a number experts say is much higher.

“I got antibodies,” he said before saying the mix of drugs his medical team gave to him made him “feel like Superman – I was like, ‘Let me at ’em’.”

He appeared to yet again downplay the virus, which has killed over 215,000 people in the United States: “I had it. And I’m here.”

Rally participants seated behind him were mostly wearing “MAGA” masks handed out by his campaign. But photographers and C-SPAN cameras showed rally-goers not on camera mostly skipped wearing a face covering even as the coronavirus is spreading again across the country.

The president made a rather bold plea to one of the voting blocs he won in 2016 but lost two years later in congressional elections – and needs again in the right mix of states to secure another term.

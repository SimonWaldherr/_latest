<div><p>Do these figures warrant the complete shutdown of the country as has now been proposed? The Labour First Minister, Mark Drakeford, who has already introduced scores of emergency measures, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/wales-lockdown-fire-break-latest-local-rules-welsh-restrictions/">announced a two-week &#8220;firebreak&#8221; to stop the spread of the disease</a>. With the exception of primary schools, the lockdown is almost as drastic as that imposed earlier in the year, even though the circumstances are far less threatening than they appeared to be then.</p>
<p>This is what Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, wants to impose on England, and Nicola Sturgeon will doubtless move in this direction soon in Scotland. They seem oblivious to the impact this is having on jobs, businesses and livelihoods in places that have hardly seen a case of Covid. The Welsh government is demanding money from the central Treasury to fund this pig-in-a-poke approach, just as Manchester is being offered extra millions to ameliorate the impact of a severe lockdown, even though Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor, and most of the region&#8217;s MPs do not think it is warranted.</p>
<p>Mr Drakeford says action is urgently needed yet he is waiting until Friday to implement the new controls, which makes no sense. He also claims it is needed in order to &#8220;buy time&#8221; but to what end he does not say. If he removes the so-called &#8220;firebreak&#8221; in a fortnight and cases go back up, what then? Supporters talk fancifully of &#8220;eradicating&#8221; the disease, something that would only be achievable by locking down until it has gone and then cutting Wales off from the rest of the UK. Is that the plan? If not, what is it?</p>

The Patriots’ dinner-gate lives on.

After Stephon Gilmore’s wife, Gabrielle, tweeted Tuesday that “there was no dinner out” between Gilmore and Cam Newton, in response to ESPN’s Adam Schefter mentioning the two Patriots had dined together before both eventually tested positive for COVID-19, Schefter came back Wednesday with a clarification.

“They might not have been out to dinner. I don’t know whether they had dinner at Cam’s house or Stephon Gilmore’s house or at the Patriots, but they had dinner together Friday night,” Schefter said on WEEI’s “The Greg Hill Show” in Boston on Wednesday morning.

The alleged dinner happened on Oct. 2, the Friday night before Newton was revealed to have tested positive for COVID-19. The Patriots went on to play Monday night in Kansas City before Gilmore was revealed to have tested positive for the virus that Wednesday.

That day, Schefter brought up the dinner during an appearance on 97.5 The Fanatic in Philadelphia, saying, “I was told that in the New England area, over the weekend, that Cam Newton and Stephon Gilmore were spotted having dinner together on Friday night.”

That came back into the spotlight on Tuesday, when Gilmore’s wife quote-tweeted a story that included a reference to the reported dinner.

“There was no dinner out, I’m going to help you out so you guys stop reporting false news,” Gabrielle tweeted.

Wednesday, Schefter indicated it may have been more about semantics, but insisted that the dinner did happen.

“I have real respect for Stephen Gilmore, Mrs. Gilmore, [and] I’m not looking to refute anybody,” he said. “They weren’t out to dinner. I don’t know why this is an issue. Cam Newton tested positive early Saturday morning. The night before, Stephon Gilmore and Cam Newton had dinner. That’s all. They didn’t do anything wrong. There’s nothing to that. They had dinner. What’s the problem? … It’s nobody’s fault, but they did have dinner Friday night.

“I was basically on another radio station when it came up and at that moment, it came up at the point that Stephon Gilmore had just tested positive or was placed on the list. I was asked about it and said, ‘Well that’s interesting, he did have dinner with Cam on Friday night.’ It wasn’t a report, it wasn’t anything, it was just a fact. That’s all it is. I’m not trying to upset anybody, I’m not trying to point any fingers, not making accusations. They had dinner Friday night, what’s the big deal?”

Schefter said that he doesn’t know where Gilmore and Newton had dinner, but didn’t believe that it was “out to dinner, like out in Boston.”

Two more Patriots, Bill Murray and Byron Cowart, have since tested positive for COVID-19, according to reports. The Patriots’ Week 5 game against the Broncos was eventually postponed to this coming Sunday and their facility was shut down. They are now set to hold their first practice of the week on Thursday, according to ESPN.

Issue 2</a> colorway dedicated to the forthcoming celebrations of Day of the Dead, <a href="https://sneakernews.com/tag/donovan-mitchell/">Donovan Mitchell</a> is extending his run of themed colorways this month with a brand new rendition symbolic of his sweet tooth. Turning a guilty pleasure into sneaker form, the bouncy Utah guard and his adidas camp turn to a popular candy aisle offering for inspiration &#8212; gummy bears.</p>
<p>An overt nod to the ever-satisfying Haribo Gold Bears snack, this hoops-ready installment translates the aesthetic of its packaging by shrouding its leather base layer, mesh side paneling, leather heel overlays, and midsoles with &#8220;Metallic Gold&#8221; and welcomes in notes of black trim along pasted to the sock liner and zig-zagged lateral/medial decor to likely represent the branded font. Wallpapered atop the heels and treading entirely arrives blurred-out imagery of multi-colored gummy bears which essentially verify its sugar-inspired intentions. As of now, these are scheduled to launch overseas on October 23rd, but stay tuned as we gather more knowledge of its stateside release on<a href="http://bit.ly/2MVS7wt"> adidas.com</a> for $100 USD.</p>

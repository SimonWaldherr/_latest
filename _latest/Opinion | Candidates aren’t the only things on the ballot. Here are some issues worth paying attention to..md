  Opinion | Candidates aren’t the only things on the ballot. Here are some issues worth paying attention to. 
description: > 
  Amid the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has brought a larger reconsideration of racial barriers, California is considering Proposition 16.This year’s measure would leave the cap on homeowners’ property taxes, fixed to what they paid for their houses, but would tie what commercial ventures pay to the actual market value of their properties.By one estimate, it could raise taxes by as much as $11.5 billion a year, starting in 2025.State and local experiments that succeed tend to catch on elsewhere.After a string of ballot initiatives in 2004 and 2008 banned same-sex marriage, the backlash changed the social climate around the issue.

The measure would bring back affirmative action, a reversal of what the state did in 1996, when 54.6 percent voted to amend the state constitution to prohibit government institutions from considering race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, public contracting or public education. Proposition 16&#8217;s prospects <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-18/proposition-16-affirmative-action-california-election">are unclear</a>; if it fails, the affirmative action ban would stay in place.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Also on the ballot across the country are <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/justice-ballot-2020">at least 20 statewide and local initiatives</a> that would deal with criminal justice &#8212; from measures in Columbus, Ohio, and Portland, Maine, that would establish civilian review boards to investigate claims of police misconduct, to a proposed constitutional amendment in Michigan that would require a search warrant for law enforcement to gain access to anyone&#8217;s electronic communications.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Here&#8217;s why you should pay attention to these sorts of questions, even when they are being decided upon thousands of miles away from where you live: &#8220;Initiatives are much better at predicting the future than individual races,&#8221; says Grover Norquist, the veteran conservative activist who heads the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Among the ones that Norquist has his eye on this year is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/prop-15-property-taxes-impact-california-funding/">California&#8217;s Proposition 15,</a> which would partially repeal a radical 1978 initiative known as Proposition 13 that put a lid on property taxes in a state of soaring real estate prices, squeezing local government of revenue. This year&#8217;s measure would leave the cap on homeowners&#8217; property taxes, fixed to what they paid for their houses, but would tie what commercial ventures pay to the actual market value of their properties.

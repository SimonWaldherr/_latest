The next phase, which would have brought kindergartners and pre-kindergarteners back into school buildings, had been scheduled for as soon as mid-October, but was recently delayed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I am heartbroken that today we have to close our doors to our highest-need students,&#8221; the superintendent, Brenda Cassellius, said. Those students include some students with disabilities, students who have experienced homelessness and students still learning English.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The city&#8217;s seven-day average positivity rate for coronavirus testing recently increased to 5.7 percent. The city said that it would welcome back high-needs students when the positivity rate declined to 5 percent or below for two consecutive weeks and would begin the phased return of other students when it declined to 4 percent or below for two consecutive weeks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Cassellius urged the community to comply with public health guidance in order to bring the infection rate down. &#8220;We need your help,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our children are depending on all of us.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Experts said that closing schools might be the right decision given what looks like a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surge in cases</a>, but questioned why the city was not closing anything else or putting forward a larger strategy to curtail transmission.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Why would you ever have restaurants open for indoor dining while you&#8217;re closing schools? It&#8217;s wrong on so many levels,&#8221; said Dr. Benjamin P. Linas, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Boston University.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The evidence now is that restaurants drive transmission and schools do not,&#8221; he added.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He said the decision to close schools seemed like political expediency, since there is pressure to close schools from the teachers&#8217; union, and pressure to keep other activities going, from businesses and members of the public who have pandemic fatigue.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler and assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health, criticized the city for delaying the opening of schools for most students until late October, given that many epidemiologists had predicted a surge in cases as the weather cooled.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We&#8216;ve squandered the opportunity to have kids in school and feel comfortable about it by delaying school until the end of October,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just so mad.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-taylor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="new-jerseys-governor-philip-murphy-will-quarantine-after-a-staff-member-tests-positive"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#new-jerseys-governor-philip-murphy-will-quarantine-after-a-staff-member-tests-positive">New Jersey&#8217;s governor, Philip Murphy, will quarantine after a staff member tests positive.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Gov.

He said he had been in &#8220;close proximity&#8221; to the staff member on Saturday before the individual tested positive, and he said he has not experienced any symptoms of Covid-19.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Murphy tested negative for the virus on Monday and Wednesday, according to a statement from his office but it did not specify the kind of tests he took. The statement also said that both Mr. Murphy and his wife would cancel their in-person events and quarantine through the end of the weekend and take another test &#8220;before they resume any in-person engagements.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/health/coronavirus-testing-negative.html" title="">The negative virus test results</a> so far do not rule out the possibility that Mr. Murphy was infected, as the levels of virus<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/health/coronavirus-superspreading-contagion.html" title=""> could take days</a> to build in the body.

Earlier this month, President Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/politics/trump-covid.html" title="">revealed that he</a> had contracted the virus and was subsequently hospitalized with Covid-19.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain was in intensive care in April with the virus and has since returned to work. The leaders of Brazil, Honduras, Guatemala and Bolivia have also contracted the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fox29.com/news/murphy-no-one-should-have-gone-to-trump-fundraiser-at-bedminster-golf-club" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously criticized</a> Mr. Trump&#8217;s decision to hold a fund-raiser at Bedminster, N.J., <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/04/us/trump-covid-symptoms-timeline.html" title="">after a senior Trump aide, Hope Hicks,</a> had tested positive.

But because nearly all of the state&#8217;s prisons are overcrowded, it remains unclear where San Quentin inmates could be sent.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a statement on Wednesday, a California Department of Corrections spokeswoman said &#8220;we respectfully disagree with the court&#8217;s determination,&#8221; and added that the prison system had sought to stem the virus in a number of ways, including by releasing more than 21,000 inmates.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Inmate transfers appear to be what created the problem in San Quentin to begin with.  The prison was  free of the coronavirus until late May, when state officials ordered 121 inmates moved there from another state prison, the California Institution for Men in Chino, Calif.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Officials have acknowledged that few&#160;if any of those inmates had been tested for the coronavirus in the three weeks prior to the move, nor were they tested on arrival at San Quentin.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Within weeks, San Quentin had a surging virus outbreak, and for several months the prison had the largest coronavirus cluster in the nation, according to a New York Times <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#clusters" title="">database</a>.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  Rebecca Griesbach and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/timothy-williams" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="conservatives-press-trump-to-modernize-the-cdcs-health-data-system"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#conservatives-press-trump-to-modernize-the-cdcs-health-data-system">Conservatives press Trump to modernize the C.D.C.&#8217;s health data system.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Rick Santorum, who once represented Pennsylvania in the Senate, was among the authors of a letter sent to the White House on Monday urging the president to improve health data collection." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/multimedia/21virus-briefing-santorum/merlin_168481401_a4d75cb6-1ed5-4285-8627-f6235541e2d3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Rick Santorum, who once represented Pennsylvania in the Senate, was among the authors of a letter sent to the White House on Monday urging the president to improve health data collection.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Patrick Semansky/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A group of conservative health care advocates, policy experts and economists is pressing President Trump to modernize the nation&#8217;s public health data infrastructure so that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can once again be the primary collector of information about Covid-19.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/hccg-to-president-cdc-fin-by-organization-3/04b2e65508362993/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter sent to the White House</a> on Monday, the group, which includes former Senator Rick Santorum and other prominent conservatives, took aim at the C.D.C., saying that the agency had failed to &#8220;modernize its antiquated and burdensome public health data systems,&#8221; despite a series of laws passed by Congress in 2006, 2013 and 2019 requiring it to do so.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It is shocking that C.D.C. has failed to comply with these laws,&#8221; the authors wrote. &#8220;Despite fourteen years and billions of dollars spent, C.D.C. has yet to implement a nationwide, modern and uniform information-management and reporting system to help guide policymakers, public health officials and front-line health care workers.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The letter <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/order-defeat-covid-19-the-federal-government-must-modernize-its-public" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew out of a report</a> published in September by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">C.D.C. officials were not immediately available for comment.

Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services, the C.D.C.&#8217;s parent agency, stripped the C.D.C. of control over the gathering of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/us/politics/coronavirus-data.html" title="">hospital information</a> and turned the job over to a private contractor, TeleTracking Inc.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Health experts, including outside advisers to the C.D.C., <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/us/politics/health-experts-warning-coronavirus-data.html" title="">warned</a> that the move would have &#8220;serious consequences on data integrity.&#8221; But the department recently extended TeleTracking&#8217;s initial $10.2 million, six-month contract.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Heritage report described the private data collection as a &#8220;stopgap measure&#8221; that was important but &#8220;incomplete.&#8221; Joel C.

And then we said, we put in place the restrictions. We then watched the data for 14 days. We come back after 14 days, and we make whatever adjustments. The adjustments we&#8217;re going to make are these: to exit a red zone under 3 percent after 10 days, 4 percent in less-populated areas. What does that mean? The virus spreads faster in a denser population than in a more rural population. In a more rural area, you come into effect with &#8212; come into contact and proximity with fewer people than in a denser environment.

The lockdown &#8212; which divided virus hot spots into three color-coded zones of red, orange and yellow &#8212; were intended to combat worrisome virus test positivity rates in Brooklyn, Queens and New York City&#8217;s northern suburbs, and also imposed tight restrictions on houses of worship and restaurants.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo provided new metrics for how the state will determine changes and updates to the color-coded boundaries. For the most serious restrictions to be lifted, an area in a red zone would have to remain under a virus positivity rate of 3 percent after 10 days, while the rates to leave orange and yellow zones would be 2 percent and 1.5 percent respectively after 10 days. He noted that in less populated areas, the benchmark would be slightly higher as &#8220;in a more rural area, you come into contact with fewer people.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The rules affected many neighborhoods with large populations of Orthodox Jewish residents and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-shutdown-cuomo.html" title="">sparked an immediate backlash</a> in some areas when they were announced earlier this month.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The governor said the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/nygovcuomo/status/1313567255247106051?s=21" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rules for each zone</a>, which allowed schools that fell in yellow zones to remain open and restaurants to operate both indoor and outdoor dining, would not change.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/troy-closson" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="scientists-raise-doubts-about-britains-plan-to-deliberately-infect-volunteers"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#scientists-raise-doubts-about-britains-plan-to-deliberately-infect-volunteers">Scientists raise doubts about Britain&#8217;s plan to deliberately infect volunteers.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="In London on Sunday.

The researchers &#8212; working with Imperial College London and hVivo, a company specializing in such studies, with backing from the British government &#8212; have not said what vaccines they will test.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There are also steep limits to what scientists can learn about real-world transmission from exposing people in secure isolation units. Does a vaccine that protects healthy, younger volunteers &#8212; the only group eligible for deliberate infection &#8212; also help the people most endangered by the coronavirus, older adults or people with pre-existing conditions?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And is dripping virus into a volunteer&#8217;s nose anything like the exposure people receive at work or in their homes?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Is it breathed out, sneezed out, do you sniff it all in one fell chunk of virus coming at you?&#8221; said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. &#8220;No one really knows. It&#8217;s so hard to model.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For now, scientists overseeing the trial, scheduled to begin in January, said they would use <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/health/coronavirus-remdesivir-who.html" title="">the antiviral medicine remdesivir</a> to treat volunteers before the onset of symptoms.

This week, tourism officials were pleased to announce the arrival of 39.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was the first group of foreign tourists to arrive in the kingdom in more than six months.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Thailand took a big hit to its economy after it closed its borders to foreign tourists in April to contain the coronavirus. Officials have been trying for months to bring back tourists through a special visa and quarantine program and, after several false starts, the group of 39 arrived from Shanghai on Tuesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The travelers went directly into quarantine at a Bangkok hotel, where they will remain for 14 days at their own expense.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, said in an interview on Wednesday that he hopes the group&#8217;s arrival will open the door to travelers from other low-risk countries, such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. The new visa allows stays of up to 270 days.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Thailand was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/world/asia/coronavirus-thailand-photos.html" title="">the first country after China</a> to report a case of coronavirus, which was brought by a tourist from Wuhan in January. But the kingdom has been among the most successful in containing the virus, reporting only 3,709 cases and 59 deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The challenge now is to revive the economy.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">During the second quarter of this year, Thailand suffered its biggest contraction since the late 1990s as the economy shrank by 12.2 percent, according to the state planning council.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Although tourists were barred, thousands of Thais returned from abroad and went through quarantine. Hundreds have tested positive without any reports of the virus spreading into the community.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;That is why we are confident in bringing tourists in at this time,&#8221; Mr. Yuthasak said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For now, the arrivals may throw a lifeline to a few hotels that have set themselves up as quarantine centers, but it will do little to help the struggling tourist economy. Many hotels are closed, and others are operating at a loss to satisfy demands from their lenders.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/richard-c-paddock" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="stimulus-talks"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#stimulus-talks">White House says aid to states and cities is the biggest stimulus sticking point.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/business/21markets-brf-stimulus/merlin_178837629_a1a8cc1a-b0e0-4bed-8a09-e5d050c5fc23-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Pool photo by Chris Kleponis/EPA, via Shutterstock</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said on Wednesday that a call by Democrats for hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid for states and cities and their resistance to a liability shield for businesses remained the toughest obstacles to a stimulus deal.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The biggest issue remains state and local assistance,&#8221; Mr. Meadows said on the Fox Business Network. &#8220;That remains a stumbling block.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">His remarks came hours before <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/stimulus-deal-mitch-mcconnell-nancy-pelosi.html" title="">Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin</a> were scheduled to continue talks on a broad pandemic relief package in hopes of reaching a deal this week, even as congressional Republicans fought to prevent such a compromise from materializing before Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Mnuchin, who is returning from a trip to the Middle East, and Ms. Pelosi planned to speak later on Wednesday. The two sides have been trying to reach an agreement on another round of economic aid that could be enacted before Nov. 3. But Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has told the White House to abandon its efforts, concerned about the political fallout for Republicans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Meadows suggested that progress was being made, but said he feared that politics could get in the way. Ms. Pelosi on Tuesday signaled that Democrats were preparing counteroffers on both liability protections for businesses that are seeking to reopen and state and local funding.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The White House has proposed providing $250 billion to states and municipalities, Mr. Meadows said, while House Democrats have called for double that. He also said that the liability protections were a crucial priority for Republicans, and he chided Ms. Pelosi for resisting them, saying she was being &#8220;disingenuous&#8221; if she believed that his party would agree to any deal without them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Even as Republicans resisted a compromise, pressure was mounting from rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties to reach one. A bipartisan group of House lawmakers on Wednesday wrote to congressional leaders and Mr. Trump urging a resolution before the November elections.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We know there may be remaining issues to be resolved between the negotiators, but it appears those issues are certainly solvable,&#8221; the group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, wrote. &#8220;Our families, businesses, and local communities don&#8217;t have the luxury of time so Washington can continue its partisan games. We must do our job and do it now.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Across the Capitol, Senate Democrats blocked a move by Republicans to advance a $500 billion plan that would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits and a popular federal loan program for small businesses, as well as provide additional money for testing. Democrats, who have argued the package falls far short of the level of aid needed, unanimously opposed it, and it fell short on a party-line vote of 51-44, failing to clear the 60-vote threshold required to move forward.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-rappeport" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#big-tens-football-debut-raises-concerns-for-local-mayors">Big Ten&#8217;s football debut raises concerns for local mayors.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Spartan Stadium at Michigan State University last month.

Andrew M. Cuomo to order lockdowns in several parts of Brooklyn and Queens where the rate of positive test results has risen most sharply. The restrictions mostly affected neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations. But other neighborhoods faced partial lockdowns, including the canceling of indoor dining. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo announced <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/21/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates/cuomo-will-ease-restrictions-in-some-nyc-virus-hot-spots" title="">that restrictions would be eased in some hot spots in New York City</a>, while rules would be tightened in other areas.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The increases have rattled many people in those neighborhoods and beyond, reminding them of the dark days of March and April when it was impossible to meet friends, eat out at a restaurant, go to church or visit parents. Some residents are back to stockpiling medicine and rubbing alcohol, while others are putting their plans to return to their offices on indefinite hold.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Some New Yorkers see the rise in cases as a harbinger, the footfalls that announce an intruder&#8217;s arrival.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I feel like the second wave is here &#8212; that same kind of doomsday feeling,&#8221; said Anya Ferring, 40, a fashion production consultant who lives in Far Rockaway, Queens, one of the neighborhoods experiencing a partial lockdown.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In several interviews in the past several weeks, city residents shared deep frustrations with their fellow New Yorkers who don&#8217;t appear to be following the same rules on wearing masks and social distancing. The solidarity forged in the springtime outbreak appears, in some neighborhoods, to have fractured in the fall.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Zoe Neuschatz, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, said she and her boyfriend have been mostly staying at home since the pandemic began, and they have no plans of letting up and have even considered stockpiling supplies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s my post-trauma stress from the spring,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a nerd about it.

At that point most countries locked down, stopping movement and much interpersonal contact. Strategies have changed, and today local lockdowns are the way forward for most. There is more testing, giving a clearer picture of the pandemic. But the numbers continue to grow.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Over the past week in the United States, there have been 421,114 new cases, illustrating that the long-predicted fall wave of the virus is well underway.  Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states are struggling to control major outbreaks. And <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/coronavirus-cases-rise.html" title="">the national trajectory is worsening by the day</a>, as the cooler weather drives more people to stay indoors where the virus spreads easily. In some states, hospitals are almost full.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">India reported 411,718 over the past seven days, but numbers have been falling since mid-September. On Monday, the country recorded fewer than 50,000 cases, the lowest number since July, the government said. But the lower numbers, which would seem at first glance to be good news, have raised questions. The government recently approved the use of rapid coronavirus testing based on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53609404" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gene-editing technology</a>, hoping to increase its testing capabilities. But experts question the reliability of rapid tests. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In France, which has added 174,273 cases in the past seven days, a curfew has been implemented in Paris and eight other regions. Still, more than 11,000 virus patients are hospitalized, and 2,000 are in intensive care, a threshold that had not been reached since May. (The country currently has 5,800 intensive care beds.) </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Brazil, which has reported 160,326 cases in the past seven days, is among the countries with the lowest testing rates and still lacks a clear contact tracing policy. Despite being the country with the second-highest death toll, about eight million Brazilians had received laboratory tests by mid-October, according to the Ministry of Health, less than a tenth of the number of people tested in the United States. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But, as in India, the disease has been trending downward in Brazil since early August. The country is now reporting an average of 500 deaths a day, half of the daily toll it reported two months ago. Most big cities have eased  social-distancing measures and opened some schools, restaurants, and beaches.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The number of daily recorded infections in Britain, which includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, has nearly tripled since the beginning of October. In the past seven days, Britain has reported 127,622 new cases. Hospitalizations and deaths are also rising, and in some parts of the country, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/18/revealed-some-manchester-area-hospitals-already-full" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intensive care units are being stretched</a> to their limits. The countries that make up Britain are each forging their own paths: England has implemented a tiered alert system; Northern Ireland is ramping up restrictions for pubs and restaurants, and closing schools; Scotland implemented a two-week tightening of restrictions; and Wales was preparing to enter a two-week national lockdown.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Russia has added 103,992 new cases in the past seven days.. The government, however, has resisted imposing even local lockdowns, although it has started to enforce mask-wearing requirements The capital, Moscow, is recording about one-third of the country&#8217;s daily new cases. Health authorities there have opened temporary hospitals in a city park and in a large car-dealership center.  But Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said curfews and business closings are &#8220;absolutely unacceptable and impossible for us.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Argentina has reported 101,964 cases in the past seven days. It is the fifth country to surpass one million total cases.  The country received praise early in the pandemic for imposing a strict quarantine in mid-March, and although certain restrictions have been relaxed, much of the country is still under some type of lockdown order. Still, the virus, which was once concentrated in the Buenos Aires area, has since expanded to much of the country, including remote areas with scarce medical resources.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  Kaly Soto, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eileen-sullivan" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Eileen Sullivan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sameer-yasir" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sameer Yasir</a>, Antonella Francini, Manuela Andreoni, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anna-schaverien" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Anna Schaverien</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anton-troianovski" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Anton Troianovski</a> and </p><p class="css-608m5d" id="worried-about-the-virus-in-the-winter-alaska-offers-a-cautionary-tale"></p><p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70">U.S. Roundup</p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#worried-about-the-virus-in-the-winter-alaska-offers-a-cautionary-tale">Worried about the virus in the winter?

But officials had also done <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html" title="">more testing than almost every other state</a> and then tracked every person who came back positive with an army of contact tracers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Now, as temperatures begin dipping back below freezing, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/coronavirus-cold-weather-winter-alaska.html" title="">the virus has seized new opportunities</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Alaska&#8217;s struggles provide an early warning that winter could bring the most devastating phase of the pandemic.

Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska&#8217;s chief medical officer, described one small community with no running water that is currently dealing with an outbreak, and weather has prevented officials from getting supplies in.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">One of the challenges that Dr. Zink has consistently faced is convincing residents to wear masks and stay distanced. In May, when Gov. Mike Dunleavy lifted statewide restrictions, he left decisions about how to manage the pandemic to local jurisdictions.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the town of Wasilla over the weekend, people gathered at a bar for an Oktoberfest celebration. While the outdoor seating offered views of snow-capped mountains, the weather was near freezing, so people crowded inside, where no one was wearing masks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And at a youth hockey tournament this month in Anchorage, videos showed some parents watching from the stands without masks.

The mismanagement of the scheme is widely regarded to have led to a second wave of the virus in Victoria. The outbreak put Melbourne, which is in the state of Victoria and is the second-largest city in Australia, into lockdown for over three months.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Monday, the authorities said that blood glucose monitoring devices intended for use by one person were used on multiple guests held in the hotels between March and August. The tests were used by people with diabetes to monitor blood sugar levels.

Even if the drugs are proven to work &#8212; still a big if &#8212; there&#8217;s little chance that they will soon be widely available. A smooth distribution of the antibody treatments will be dependent on the very same factors that have so far bedeviled the country&#8217;s response to Covid-19: fast and plentiful testing, coordination between state and federal officials, and equitable access to health care.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Supply will be extremely limited at first, even though the pool of patients who might benefit is vast, raising messy questions about who should be first in line for treatment.

Eli Lilly, which is developing a similar product, has said it will have 100,000 doses at first. Regeneron will eventually have 300,000 doses, and Eli Lilly will have up to one million before the end of the year.

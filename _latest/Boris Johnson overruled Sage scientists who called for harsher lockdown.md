Mr Johnson stepped back from imposing harsh new lockdown measures on other parts of the North after local leaders refused to accept them. Elected Mayors and council leaders believe they will be complicit in making businesses bankrupt if they agree to close pubs, gyms and leisure centres.

On Monday night, newly released Sage papers revealed that the Government's scientific advisers had called for national measures. In the documents, dated September 20 and 21, the scientists called for the immediate consideration of five national measures, saying none of them would be sufficient on their own.

"The shortlist of non-pharmaceutical interventions that should be considered for immediate introduction includes a circuit-breaker (short period of lockdown) to return incidence to low levels; advice to work from home for all those that can; banning all contact within the home with members of other households, except members of a support bubble; closure of all bars, restaurants cafes, indoor gyms and personal services (eg hairdressers); all university and college teaching to be online unless face-to-face teaching is absolutely essential," the papers said.

A related paper warned: "As over 90 per cent of the population remains susceptible, not acting now to reduce cases will result in a very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences in terms of direct Covid-related deaths and the ability of the health service to meet needs.

"A package of interventions will need to be adopted to prevent this exponential rise in cases. Single interventions are unlikely to be able to reduce incidence."

Measures could be imposed at a regional or national level, the papers suggest. But they go on to stress: “Both local and national measures are needed: measures should not be applied in too specific a geographical area.”

At the Downing Street briefing, Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer and a member of Sage, said he was not confident that the "baseline" measures announced for tier three areas – those with the highest Covid infection rates – would be sufficient to reverse the rise of the virus.

It left Mr Johnson having to warn local leaders that if they do not agree to lockdown measures, they will be imposed by the Government "to protect public health". The Prime Minister also faces a battle to win over his own MPs, with dozens threatening to withhold support when the three tiers are put to separate votes in Parliament on Tuesday.

He hinted at better news to come for vulnerable people who have been forced to shield as he suggested the Government would change its approach because of the "mental distress and loneliness" it causes.

Unveiling the long-awaited three-tier system, he said it would simplify the complex and confusing rules imposed on different areas.

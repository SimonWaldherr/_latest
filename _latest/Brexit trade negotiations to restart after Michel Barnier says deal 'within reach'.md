<div><p>A Brexit&#160;trade deal could be done in a fortnight after the European Union caved to British conditions in a &#8220;significant&#8221; shift that led to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/16/analysis-brexit-trade-talks-still-far/">negotiations being restarted</a> in London on Thursday.</p>
<p>Michel Barnier said the new free trade agreement &#8220;was in reach&#8221; and UK sources said it could be struck in &#8220;two to three weeks&#8221;.</p>
<p>Both sides have agreed a schedule of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/19/uk-firmness-brussels-brexit-paying-claims-michael-gove/">daily, intensive talks up</a> to the EU&#8217;s deadline at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Lord Frost was convinced Brussels was bringing a &#8220;fundamental&#8221; change of approach to the stalled negotiations after Mr Barnier gave a conciliatory speech in the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have agreed that a basis for negotiations with the EU and Michel Barnier has been re-established,&#8221; Lord Frost, the UK&#8217;s top Brexit official, said as he rebooted trade talks.</p>
<p>Mr Barnier, the EU&#8217;s chief negotiator, said: &#8220;We will seek the necessary compromises on both sides. In order to do our utmost to reach an agreement, we will do so right up until the last day that it&#8217;s possible to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want a deal that will be mutually beneficial to both parties in respect of the autonomy and sovereignty of both sides. A deal reflecting a balanced compromise.</p>
<p>&#8220;An agreement is within reach,&#8221; he said, as the pound made its biggest gains since March.</p>
<p>Mr Barnier&#8217;s explicit admission that the EU, as well as the UK, would have to compromise on its red lines and that British sovereignty would be respected brought the breakthrough.</p>
<p>His calls for intensive, daily talks on all subjects, rather than just the three major sticking points, and on the basis of legal texts, satisfied UK preconditions for a return to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson had declared that he was ready to &#8220;embrace&#8221; World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms from Jan 1 after his Oct 15 no-deal deadline was missed. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/16/boris-johnson-circuit-breaker-manchester-lockdown-brexit-news/">Trade talks were over, he said on Friday,</a> after the EU called on the UK to &#8220;move&#8221; from its negotiating position.</p>

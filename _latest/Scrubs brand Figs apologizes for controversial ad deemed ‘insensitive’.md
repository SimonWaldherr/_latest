<div><p>A new ad for Figs scrubs is D-O-A, according to an angry group of medical professionals.</p>
<p>The offending video features a young woman in hot-pink comfort scrubs and glasses reading &#8220;Medical Terminology for Dummies&#8221; &#8212; with the book upside down.</p>
<p>Hundreds of doctors, nurses and medical students <a href="https://twitter.com/wearfigs/status/1316025835191635973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> Tuesday to express their outrage at the company, founded by two women &#8212; Heather Hasson and Trina Spear &#8212; for promoting what many pointed out is a negative stereotype of female doctors and medical professionals.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based brand, which also makes activewear and recently designed a sneaker with New Balance, bills itself as a &#8220;disruptor&#8221; in the medical apparel space and has grown fast since its founding in 2013.</p>
<p>The company has raised $75 million in funding, $65 million of that coming in 2018 in a Series B round, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/figs-scrubs-controversy-medical-terms-for-dummies-video-apology-1234634196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WWD reported</a>. Plus, it&#8217;s a favorite brand among <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/02/03/doctors-and-nurses-are-influencers-now-but-can-you-trust-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medical influencers</a>, who pose for pictures in the uniforms at Figs-sponsored retreats and hawk them to followers with discount codes.</p>
 
<p>But medical professionals are lashing out at the company for their portrayal of women docs, specifically DOs, for being less educated or incompetent. A close-up of the model&#8217;s drawstring scrubs features a mock-up hospital badge reading &#8220;DO,&#8221; short for &#8220;Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine,&#8221; a job which takes a more holistic approach to disease, as opposed to docs with MD degrees.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a female and a DO medical student, I am disgusted by how disrespectful and disheartening this ad is,&#8221; wrote one <a href="https://twitter.com/seslaton15/status/1316087903127138304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objector on Twitter.</a>&#160;&#8220;Physicians (both DO/MD alike) work TIRELESSLY for the health of their communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do better,&#8221; commented another <a href="https://twitter.com/missmedstudent/status/1316046394772217856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peeved med student</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny Seyfried, a VP of marketing at Figs previously told The Post, &#8220;One of the amazing benefits of social media is that medical professionals can show their whole selves. In addition to being professionals, they&#8217;re people. They watch &#8216;The Bachelor&#8217; just like us.&#8221;</p>
<p>They may now reconsider being buddy-buddy with customers online.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s apology &#8212;&#160; &#8220;A lot of you guys have pointed out an insensitive video we had on our site&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;We dropped the ball and and we are so sorry&#8221; &#8212; was likewise met with derision by type-As on Med Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really need to come out with the notes on this and what the thought process was going into this,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/Firefly1909/status/1316036206304489473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one tsk-tsk-er</a> online. &#8220;Let&#8217;s call it what it is, sexist. Until you own it, no apology will be enough.&#8221;</p>

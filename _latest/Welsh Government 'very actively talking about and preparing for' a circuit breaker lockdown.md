The Welsh Government is "very actively talking about and preparing for" a circuit-breaker lockdown in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said.

Mr Drakeford also called on the UK Government to consider adopting the short-term lockdown in England, saying he does not think it would be sensible for ministers to dismiss the advice of their own Sage committee of experts.

“Detailed planning" is under way to establish what measures would be put in place during a circuit-breaker, how long it would last, how schools would be treated, and how to come out of it, Mr Drakeford told Sky News.

The measures are being considered despite coronavirus having been more "effectively suppressed" in Wales than in some other parts of the UK, he claimed.

"We want to act now in order to prevent the worst from happening, to give us a better chance of getting through the rest of the autumn and the winter, and if a circuit-breaker is the right way to do it then that is what we will do,” he said.

"We're very actively talking about and preparing for that, should it be necessary."

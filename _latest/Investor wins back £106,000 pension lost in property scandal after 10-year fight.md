<div><p>A saver's 10-year battle to win back his &#163;106,000&#160;pension after he lost it to an&#160;infamous high-risk property scheme has ended in victory.</p>
<p>The 68-year-old, identified only as&#160;"Mr S" by the Financial Ombudsman Service,&#160;lost his &#163;105,800 pension after he moved his money into a risky overseas property investment on a promise that it would allow him to retire three years early.&#160;</p>
<p>He said&#160;he was told he could possibly retire early at 62 and he was looking forward to&#160;taking&#160;his family on holiday to a luxury resort.</p>
<p>In 2010 he invested his personal and workplace pension pots into <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pensions-retirement/news/pensioners-lost-everything-squeezed-run-zombie-investments/">Harlequin Property</a>, which was initially backed by famous names and&#160;financial advisers, and guaranteed high returns.&#160;</p>
<p>Harlequin&#160;took up to &#163;400m from British investors to build off-plan villas in the Caribbean but produced only a handful. "Guaranteed returns"&#160;of up to 10pc a year never materialised, and in March 2015 the Financial Services Compensation Scheme effectively declared the capital lost when it valued the investment at nil.</p>
<p>In 2015, Mr S complained his loss was caused by his financial adviser, Pacific IFA, which set up his Sipp, a self-invested personal pension, which allowed the investment to go ahead and said it failed to warn him that the transfer could put his entire fund at risk.&#160;</p>
<p>Pacific IFA maintains it has not done anything wrong.</p>
<p>In a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman, he said: &#8220;The advice I was given is inappropriate. I also believe that the full risk of doing so was not totally explained to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A decade after the transfer was first made Mr S has won a long fought battle for compensation. The ombudsman ruled that Pacific IFA should reimburse Mr S in full with the amount of money he would have had if he had not transferred his pensions in the first place, up to a total of &#163;150,000.&#160;</p>
<p>It found the adviser should have assessed the suitability of the investment itself and told Mr S that it was &#8220;too high risk&#8221; rather than simply setting up the Sipp.&#160;</p>
<p>The ombudsman said it was not made clear that he couldn&#8217;t afford any significant losses to his retirement savings so close to retirement. Mr S will also receive &#163;1,000 to make up for the distress caused.&#160;</p>
<p>Jonathan Pentelow, of Pacific IFA, said he was &#8220;very disappointed&#8221; with the decision as Mr S &#8220;knowingly rejected&#8221; their recommendation that he should not transfer out of his defined benefit workplace pension at the time.&#160;</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;At no stage did Pacific either introduce, promote or recommend to the customer to invest in Harlequin. Pacific warned the customer that it was very high risk and he could lose all his pension.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr S was told about the investment by a personal contact who happened to be another financial adviser, however he went to Pacific to open&#160;the Sipp to be able to make the investment.</p>
<p>The ombudsman&#160;said Mr S was not given enough information to allow him to make an informed decision.</p>

<p>Tiffany Riggle filed for divorce from the comedian, 50, on Oct. 5 after 20 years of marriage, according to online court records seen by Page Six.</p>
<p>Tiffany is seeking joint custody of their two children, Abigail, 16, and George, 12, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/10/18/hangover-comedian-rob-riggle-wife-files-for-divorce/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TMZ reported</a>, and is asking for spousal support. She cited irreconcilable differences as the cause of the split.</p>
<p>A rep for the &#8220;21 Jump Street&#8221; actor didn&#8217;t immediately return Page Six&#8217;s request for comment.</p>
<p>Rob married Tiffany in 1999 after meeting her in 1997 while out with friends.</p>

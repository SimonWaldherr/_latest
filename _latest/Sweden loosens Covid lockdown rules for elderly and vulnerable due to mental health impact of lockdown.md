  Sweden loosens Covid lockdown rules for elderly and vulnerable due to mental health impact of lockdown 
description: > 
  Elderly people in Sweden no longer need to isolate themselves, the government said on Thursday, pointing to lower Covid infection rates than in spring and a growing toll on the mental health of its elderly as behind the new recommendation.The move to ease the burden on the elderly comes as many countries across Europe are reimposing restrictions to get to grips with surging infections, but the health agency has said it does not see evidence of a second wave in Sweden.Sweden has taken a different approach to most other European countries in fighting the pandemic, relying on voluntary measures to promote social distancing, though it did isolate nursing homes after high levels of deaths among residents.Sweden has seen around 107,000 cases in total and roughly 5,900 deaths.It registered 975 new cases on Wednesday and seven additional deaths, far lower than during the spring peak but still well above the case load during summer.

Facebook moved Wednesday to limit the spread of The Post’s reporting on bombshell emails from Hunter Biden’s laptop that show he introduced his father, Joe Biden, to a Ukrainian energy executive, a company spokesman said.

The social network may also have independent fact-checkers examine the exclusive story based on the younger Biden’s emails, according to Facebook spokesman Andy Stone.

“While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post, I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook’s third-party fact checking partners,” Stone said on Twitter. “In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform.”

It was not immediately clear from Stone’s tweet whether Facebook would apply that treatment to just one or all of The Post’s stories about Biden’s private correspondence, which was obtained from a hard drive left at a Delaware computer repair shop.

Facebook generally asks fact-checkers to review stories that the company thinks contain misinformation. The Silicon Valley titan says it adds labels to content that’s been fact-checked so “people can read additional context.”

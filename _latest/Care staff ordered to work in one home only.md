<div><p>Staff will be banned from working in more than one care home in an attempt to halt the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Telegraph understands the Government is drawing up legislation that will make it illegal for care homes to employ <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/08/care-home-staff-may-banned-working-multiple-locations-amid-fears/">staff working at multiple sites</a>.</p>
<p>It follows concerns repeatedly expressed by Government scientists that outbreaks within the sector are <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/09/16/coronavirus-clusters-breaking-suburban-london-care-homes/">"seeding" infections</a> across whole communities, with agency workers singled out.&#160;</p>
<p>But care home chiefs warned that the ban could backfire, forcing some homes to close entirely amid widespread staff shortages. The sector is heavily dependent on agency workers, with a quarter of staff on zero-hours contracts.&#160;</p>
<p>A study by Imperial College London three weeks ago found an eight-fold increase <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/analysis-latest-infection-data-suggest-us-quietly-following/">in cases among the over-65s</a> compared with September &#8211; a key metric used by the Government <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/14/three-tier-lockdown-what-new-system-covid-rules-explained/">when deciding levels of restrictions</a>. Last month, it was reported that Covid&#160;outbreaks were detected in 43 <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/09/12/coronavirus-spreading-care-homes-government-warns/">care homes</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Government announced that South Yorkshire would move into the toughest tier of coronavirus restrictions from Saturday. Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/west-south-yorkshire-tier-2-leeds-sheffield-local-lockdown-rules/">will all go into Tier 3</a>, which is now affecting more than seven million people.</p>
<p>The announcement came the day after Greater Manchester <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/21/manchester-lockdown-rules-tier-2-3-andy-burnham-latest/">was shifted into the top tier</a>. There were suggestions that Nottingham and West Yorkshire <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/northern-cities-told-could-next-manchester-put-tier-3/">could be next</a>.</p>

<div><p>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</p><p>Rose McGowan called out the &#8220;liberal &#8216;intellectuals'&#8221; rushing to New Yorker scribe Jeffrey Toobin&#8217;s defense in his <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/jeffrey-toobin-was-masturbating-in-front-of-new-yorker-bigs-report/">Zoom masturbation scandal</a> &#8212; saying a woman caught in the same position would be &#8220;burned at the stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you all imagine if a conservative woman was caught masturbating on an @zoom meeting like #MeToobin? If it had been a liberal woman? If it had been a [woman of color]?&#8221; the #MeToo activist <a href="https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/1318608792494526465" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Tuesday on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Responding to another Twitter user, she mused, &#8220;Do you think there&#8217;d be liberal &#8216;intellectuals&#8217; rising to defend her? She&#8217;d be burned at the stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toobin, who is on leave as a legal analyst for CNN, said that he made an &#8220;embarrassingly stupid mistake&#8221; during the Zoom session in which he was caught pleasuring himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believed I was not visible on Zoom. I thought no one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video,&#8217;&#8217; Toobin <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdgm4/new-yorker-suspends-jeffrey-toobin-for-zoom-dick-incident" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Vice</a>.</p>
<p>Toobin has been suspended from the magazine as they investigate the incident.</p>
<p>McGowan &#8212; who was one of Harvey Weinstein accusers &#8212; has previously said that she never received any support from male directors she worked with over the course of her career after she came forward with disturbing allegations against the producer.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Of course not. Never. They&#8217;re weak,&#8221; she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/01/rose-mcgowan-edinburgh-harvey-weinstein-me-too" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the Guardian</a>.</p>

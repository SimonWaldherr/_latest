  Vaccine 'unlikely to eradicate Covid', Sir Patrick Vallance tells MPs 
description: > 
  A vaccine is unlikely to eradicate coronavirus, with the disease instead likely to become endemic in Britain, Sir Patrick Vallance has warned.Speaking at the joint committee on national security strategy, Sir Patrick said that even if a vaccine was available by the spring it would not wipe out the virus entirely."I mean, it is worth reflecting that there's only one human disease that's been truly eradicated, and that's from the highly effective vaccine to smallpox, so it's a very difficult thing to do," he told MPs and peers."We can't be certain, but I think it's unlikely we will end up with a truly sterilising vaccine, something that completely stops infection, and it's likely this disease will circulate and be endemic."Even with a vaccine, this is something weâ€™re going to need to manage."

<div><p>A vaccine is unlikely to eradicate coronavirus, with the disease instead likely to become endemic in Britain, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sir-patrick-vallance/">Sir Patrick Vallance</a> has warned.&#160;</p>
<p>The Government's chief scientific adviser said the "notion of eliminating Covid is not right", adding that people would have to learn to live with the virus.</p>
<p>Speaking at the joint committee on national security strategy, Sir Patrick said that even if <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/18/uk-could-get-coronavirus-shots-new-year-pharma-giant-pfizer/">a vaccine was available by the spring</a> it would not wipe out the virus entirely.</p>
<p>"I mean, it is worth reflecting that there's only one human disease that's been truly eradicated, and that's from the highly effective vaccine to smallpox, so it's a very difficult thing to do," he told MPs and peers.</p>
<p>"We can't be certain, but I think it's unlikely we will end up with a truly sterilising vaccine, something that completely stops infection, and it's likely this disease will circulate and be endemic.&#160;</p>
<p>"Clearly as management becomes better and you get vaccination, that would decrease the chance of infection and severity of disease, and this starts to look more like annual flu than anything else and that may be the direction we end up going.</p>
<p>"Even with a vaccine, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/09/26/scientific-experts-stiflingly-prone-erring-side-caution/">this is something we&#8217;re going to need to manage</a>."</p>

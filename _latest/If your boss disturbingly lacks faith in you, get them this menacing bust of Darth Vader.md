Do you have a boss whom you loathe but have no choice but to work for because you need your job to pay the bills and bring food to the table?

Here's a tip: Find out their birthday and get them this awesome but menacing Darth Vader bust from Royal Selangor. No, I'm serious!

Imagine walking into your boss' room and you see this. IMAGE: Royal Selangor.

Jokes aside, this bust of Darth Vader stands approximately 21cm tall and is displays one of the Sith lords' iconic pose: The 'force choke'.

With Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back turning 40 this October, 2020, the world's largest pewter manufacturer and retailer recently released this thing of beauty to celebrate the occasion.

The bust is rich with Lucasfilm-approved details and comes in three variants: In brilliant pewter, 24K gilt (limited to 300 pieces worldwide) and brilliant finish pewter with a tinted clearcoat (limited to 500 pieces worldwide).

"I find your lack of faith disturbing." IMAGE: Royal Selangor.

This makes this bust not only an epic addition to any Star Wars collection but the perfect gift for your ruthless boss whom you need.

Because let's get one thing straight: The only person who didn't get force choked was Grand Moff Tarkin.

Interested? Get the bust here.

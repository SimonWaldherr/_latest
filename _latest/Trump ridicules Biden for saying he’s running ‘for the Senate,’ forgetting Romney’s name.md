President Trump on Monday ridiculed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden for mistakenly saying at a campaign stop he’s running “for the Senate” — and appearing to forget Mitt Romney’s name.

“‘I’m running as a proud Democrat, for the Senate’. Sleepy Joe Biden today,” Trump tweeted. “It’s only going to get worse. It is not sustainable for our County – China will own us!!!!”

In another tweet, Trump wrote, “Biden losing big in Florida. Only Fake Polls show otherwise! Bad for Healthcare. Thinks he’s running for the Senate. Forgot Mitt Romney’s name, and where he was!”

Trump often accuses Biden, 77, of going senile and fired off the tweets as he traveled to Sanford, Fla., for his first campaign trip after recovering from COVID-19.

At the rally, Trump told a roaring crowd, “Sleepy Joe Biden, not a nice guy, by the way… He had a very bad day today.

“If I ever had a day like he had today, they’d say ‘It’s over. It’s over.’ … He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. He didn’t know what state he was in. And he said today he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate.”

Trump joked, “Could you imagine if I did that? ‘Great to be with you. It’s great to be a wonderful developer from New York.’ They’d say ‘he’s out of here. Get him out.’”

Biden “has got a lot of bad days coming,” Trump said.

“The one thing I know for sure, President Xi of China… President Putin of Russia… Kim Jong Un…. they are 100 percent sharp. We have someone running who is not 100 percent, he’s not 80 percent, he’s not 60 percent.”

Biden made the mistakes during a Columbus Day campaign trip to Toledo, Ohio. He previously claimed he was running for Senate during a stop in South Carolina in February.

“You know, we have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate,” Biden said, “when I ran as a proud Democrat for vice president, and I’m running as a proud Democrat for president. But I promise you this, I will govern as an American president.”

The former vice president was a longtime senator from Delaware.

Appearing to forget Utah Sen. Romney’s name, Biden said on the tarmac, “I got in trouble when we were running against that senator who was a Mormon, the governor.” Romney was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.

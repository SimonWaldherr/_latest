Soon after, they began gigging they were taken on by the ruthless pop impresario Don Arden, who got them a recording contract with Decca. “Within six weeks of the band meeting we went into the charts with all the acts of the period – Sonny and Cher, the Stones, the Animals. It was a whirlwind,” Winston recalled. Their debut single Whatcha Gonna Do About It reached No 14 in the charts.

Arden arranged for the band to appear in the teenage B-movie Dateline Diamonds (1965) as a promotional vehicle for I’ve Got Mine, the follow-up single. However, the film’s release was delayed and the song failed to chart.

Shortly afterwards Winston left the group to be replaced on keyboards by Ian McLagan.

According to Winston, Arden, and other band members, objected to a deal agreed in the early days under which Winston’s brother was paid 10 per cent of earnings for being their roadie: “Don Arden told me that this wasn’t going to work and suggested I put another band together and he would record us. I wasn’t particularly happy about the situation... but at the same time we were not getting on, there were a lot of rows and it was becoming a drag.”

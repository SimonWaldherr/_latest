  Cheeky Outfielder Catches Ball, Lets Batter Think He Hit A Home Run 
description: > 
  Lin Che-Hsuan, an outfielder for the Fubon Guardians in Taiwanâ€™s Chinese Professional Baseball League, might have a second career as an actor.In a game last week against the Uni-President Lions, he appeared to make a valiant but unsuccessful attempt to leap over the wall and steal a home run from a Lions batter, Sports Illustrated reported.His hangdog expression and body language had the batter circling the bases in joy and the announcers excitedly calling the round-tripper.Just one thing, though: Lin actually caught the ball.The Guardians won, 4-3, and Lin, who played briefly for the Boston Red Sox, caught some viral stardom for his chicanery.

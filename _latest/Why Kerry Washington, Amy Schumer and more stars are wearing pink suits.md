<p>Turns out, these tailored pieces are about making a statement in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Part of <a href="https://argentwork.com/pages/supermajority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Argent x Supermajority&#8217;s Election Collection,</a> the bold <a href="https://argentwork.com/products/supermajority-blazer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fuchsia blazer</a> ($250) and <a href="https://argentwork.com/products/supermajority-trouser" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">matching trousers</a> ($150) are intended to celebrate women&#8217;s ambition and civic power &#8220;loudly and proudly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten percent of sales from the collection &#8212; which also includes a <a href="https://argentwork.com/products/supermajority-pin-pack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pin pack</a> ($15) and <a href="https://argentwork.com/pages/supermajority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">T-shirt</a> ($25) &#8212; benefit <a href="https://supermajority.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supermajority</a>&#8216;s mission to build an intergenerational, multiracial movement for women&#8217;s equity. The organization was founded in 2019 by former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza and National Domestic Workers Alliance director Ai-jen Poo.</p>
<p>&#8220;To all the people who say our ambition is a bad look: Face it. Women are the most powerful force in America. We are the majority of people and voters in this country and we will determine the outcome of this election,&#8221; Argent&#8217;s website reads, adding of the suit, &#8220;Wear it. Share it. During the debate(s). While you make calls and send texts to voters. While you vote. On election night.&#8221;</p>
<p>And stars sure have, with Ashley Graham, America Ferrera and Busy Philipps among the many others to post photos in the suits along with the hashtags #ambitionsuitsyou and #womenarevoting.</p>
<p>The campaign even caught the eye of noted pantsuit enthusiast Hillary Clinton, who <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGVVhaMp9ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared shots</a> of Richards, Garza, Poo and more activists in their pink outfits on Instagram, along with the caption, &#8220;Love these power pantsuits, and the powerful women wearing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below, a look at the celebs who are making the stylish and symbolic suits their own.</p>
<h2>Kerry Washington</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;Gladiator in a (pink) suit &#128151;,&#8221; the &#8220;Scandal&#8221; actress captioned her shots. &#8220;Today I&#8217;m standing with @supermajority and the 94 million women who are eligible to vote early. I&#8217;m standing with every woman who boldly and unapologetically casts our ballot to make our voices heard on the issues and values that matter to US!&#8221;</p>
<h2>Amy Schumer</h2>
 
<p>The &#8220;Trainwreck&#8221; star and <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/08/13/amy-schumer-decided-she-cant-be-pregnant-ever-again/">new mom</a> fittingly held a baby bottle and pacifier in her pic.</p>
<h2>Mandy Moore</h2>
 
<p>The &#8220;This Is Us&#8221; actress paired her suit with a matching lipstick shade and black bra.</p>
<h2>Ashley Graham</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;Did you know women are the supermajority in US elections? We are the majority of voters, donors and volunteers yet were still faced with a system that doesn&#8217;t represent us and our interests,&#8221; the model wrote.</p>
<h2>Zoe Saldana</h2>
 
<p>Surrounded by lush greenery, the &#8220;Avatar&#8221; actress let her pink suit take center stage.</p>
<h2>Busy Philipps</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;Millions of women across the country are committed to casting our ballots to show the world we are unstoppable. I cast my ballot from my bed!!&#8221; the social media superstar exclaimed.</p>
<h2>America Ferrera</h2>
 
<p>The &#8220;Ugly Betty&#8221; actress teamed her fuchsia suit with bold blue eye makeup.</p>
<h2>Michelle Kwan</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;All my life, my parents raised me to be a strong woman willing to work hard, chase my dreams &amp; always be true to myself,&#8221; the Olympic figure skater wrote. &#8220;Proud to be a part of a powerful, diverse collective of women working towards a future where women are truly equal. With over 100 million voting-eligible women in America, it is so incredibly important to let your voices be heard &#8211; now more than ever!&#8221;</p>
<h2>Marisa Tomei</h2>
 
<p>The Oscar winner urged her New York-based followers to vote early with this snap.</p>
<h2>Debra Messing</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;POWER SUIT! Loud and Proud!&#8221; the &#8220;Will &amp; Grace&#8221; star exclaimed in her caption.</p>
<h2>Brooklyn Decker</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;If this suit doesn&#8217;t scream &#8216;I am ready for this debate!!&#8217; I don&#8217;t know what does,&#8221; the model wrote ahead of the vice presidential debate earlier this month.</p>
<h2>Minka Kelly</h2>
 
<p>The &#8220;Friday Night Lights&#8221; beauty styled her pantsuit with the T-shirt from the same Argent x Supermajority collaboration.</p>
<h2>Sophia Bush</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;Ambition is something I admire in womxn. There&#8217;s lots of folks out there who fear our power &#8212; we are the majority of voters and the majority of the population after all &#8212; and want to detract from our ambition, or make us ashamed of it. To those people? I say GOOD LUCK!&#8221; the &#8220;One Tree Hill&#8221; actress began her caption.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t going anywhere. We are taking up space and fighting for each other and building big, beautiful communities rooted in justice and joy. We are the @supermajority, after all &#8230; And y&#8217;all know there is nothing I love more than a power suit, and an empowered woman in one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Women love steamers and gingham. They also love Voting,&#8221; the &#8220;Strangers With Candy&#8221; star captioned this pantsless pic.</p>
<h2>Amber Tamblyn</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;Call it ambition. Call it intuition. Call it a foreshadowing&#8212; a new kind of 2020 vision. Call it showing up. Call it heavy boss energy. Educator energy. Teacher energy. Organizer energy. Good listener energy. Learner energy. You Got This energy. Election energy,&#8221; the &#8220;Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&#8221; actress captioned her shot.</p>
<h2>June Diane Raphael</h2>
 
<p>&#8220;I took off my bra and put on my @argent suit to get ready to watch tonight&#8217;s debate,&#8221; the comedian wrote ahead of the VP faceoff.</p>

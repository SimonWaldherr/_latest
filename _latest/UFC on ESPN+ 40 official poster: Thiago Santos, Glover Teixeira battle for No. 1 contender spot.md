<div><p>A pivotal light heavyweight clash will headline the UFC&#8217;s Nov. 7 event.</p>
<p>At UFC on ESPN+ 40, which takes place at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, former title challengers <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/thiago-santos">Thiago Santos</a> and <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/glover-teixeira">Glover Teixeira</a> will be vying for another crack at the title.</p>
<p>Santos (21-7 MMA, 13-6 UFC) and Teixeira (31-7 MMA, 14-5 UFC) were originally slated to meet at UFC on ESPN+ 35 on Sept. 12, but the fight was scrapped after Teixeira tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The matchup was then rebooked for Oct. 3 in Abu Dhabi, but was canceled once again, this time because Santos tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>Santos last competed in July 2019, when he was edged out by then UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones. After the fight, he underwent double knee surgery that has kept him sidelined ever since.</p>
<p>Winner of his past four in a row, Teixeira is enjoying his best run in years. He is coming off a &#8220;Performance of the Night&#8221; finish of Anthony Smith at UFC on ESPN+ 29 in May.</p>

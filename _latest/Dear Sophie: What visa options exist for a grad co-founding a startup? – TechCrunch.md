<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the visa prospects for a graduate completing an advanced degree at a university in the United States who wants to co-found a startup after graduation? Can the new startup or my co-founders sponsor me for a visa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8212;Brilliant in Berkeley</strong></p>
<p>Dear Brilliant,</p>
<p>Thank you for your questions and for your contributions. The U.S. economy greatly benefits from entrepreneurial individuals like you who create companies &#8212; and jobs &#8212; in the U.S.</p>
<p>Let me take your second question first: Yes, it is theoretically possible for your startup to sponsor you for a visa, and for one of your co-founders to be your supervisor. Many visas and employment green cards require a company to sponsor you and for you to demonstrate that a valid employer-employee relationship exists.</p>
<p>Given your situation, timing will be key, particularly since one of your best visa options is the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B Visa</a> for Specialty Occupations. The number of H-1B visas issued each year is typically capped at 85,000-60,000 for individuals with a bachelor&#8217;s degree and 25,000 for individuals with a master&#8217;s or higher degree. Because of the cap on H-1B visas and because the demand for them far outstrips the supply, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) holds a lottery once a year in the spring to determine who can apply for this visa.</p><p class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></p>			</div>

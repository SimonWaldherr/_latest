You get a call! You get a call!

Oprah Winfrey is taking part in a massive effort to get out the vote for Nov. 3 — by cold-calling Texans and making sure they have a plan to cast their ballots.

The billionaire media mogul’s day of dialing started on a high note Monday, when she reached a voter named Christian, who left her speechless with his vote-preparedness.

“Christian, this is Oprah Winfrey,” she said in a video of the exchange posted to her Instagram.

After taking a couple of seconds to make sure he wasn’t being pranked, a starstruck Christian blew Winfrey away with his responses to her questions.

The TV icon asked how ready he was to begin the Lone Star State’s early voting process on “a scale of one to 10.”

“I’m an 11” he told Winfrey, adding he’d be at the polls bright and early for the first day of early voting on Tuesday.

Winfrey, 66, was thrilled.

“You’re my first call and you’re already an 11!” she exclaimed, throwing her hands up in surprise.

“I don’t know what to say about that! That’s fantastic.”

The major voter mobilization effort is part of former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s Powered by People organization.

Other notable names to join the phone-banking operation include country music legend Willie Nelson, former presidential candidate Andrew Yang and former presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

<div><p>The lawyers in Hunter Biden&#8217;s divorce case sparred over his alleged possession of a large diamond given to him by a since-vanished Chinese energy tycoon, e-mails obtained by The Post reveal.</p>
<p>The correspondence shows a lawyer for Hunter&#8217;s then-wife, Kathleen Buhle, demanding information about the gem in an e-mail with the subject line &#8220;Biden &#8211; Urgent&#8221; and an importance level of &#8220;High.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunter is in possession of a large and extremely valuable diamond,&#8221; lawyer Rebekah Sullivan wrote on Feb. 17, 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please provide proof that the diamond has been placed in a safety deposit box &#8211; accessible only by both parties together &#8211; by noon tomorrow or we will have no choice but to ask the court, on an emergency basis, to enjoin his further dissipation of assets, including the diamond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s lawyer, Sarah Mancinelli, forwarded the e-mail to him, along with a note saying, &#8220;Can you tell me what this about and allow me to reassure them there is no issue here?&#8221;</p>
<p>In a second e-mail chain, Mancinelli forwarded a follow-up message in which Buhle&#8217;s lawyer demanded a &#8220;complete explanation, as soon as possible&#8221; regarding the diamond&#8217;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what else to tell them. If you can craft a couple of sentences for me to send her, I would appreciate it,&#8221; Sullivan wrote.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how Biden responded.</p>
<p>The gem at issue appears to be a 2.8-carat jewel that Biden told The New Yorker he got from Ye Jianming, then the chairman of CEFC China Energy Co., following an introductory dinner meeting in Miami amid Biden&#8217;s divorce.</p>
<p>In court papers, Buhle estimated the diamond was worth $80,000, while Biden put its value closer to $10,000, according to The New Yorker.</p>
<p>Biden claimed he gave the diamond to two unidentified associates who also attended the dinner meeting, saying &#8220;I knew it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden also said he didn&#8217;t believe it was intended as a bribe because his father, former VP Joe Biden, &#8220;wasn&#8217;t in office&#8221; anymore.</p>
<p>Hunter subsequently struck a series of business deals with Ye and his associates, including a three-year consulting contract worth $10 million a year, according to Biden&#8217;s e-mails and other documents.</p>
<p>Ye &#8212; who reportedly had ties to the Chinese military and intelligence &#8212; disappeared in early 2018 after being taken into custody by Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>CEFC, which was China&#8217;s largest private energy company, went bankrupt earlier this year.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s e-mails are among a trove of information extracted from a MacBook Pro laptop that was left at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019 and never retrieved, the shop owner has told The Post.</p>
<p>The computer and a hard drive with its data were seized by the FBI in December 2019 but another hard drive with the data was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">given to The Post</a> last week by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.</p>
<p>Neither of the lawyers involved in the divorce case, nor Hunter Biden&#8217;s personal lawyer, returned requests for comment.</p>

A month after the release of Inside Out, Pete Docter arrived back at Pixar Animation Studios with a plan in mind for his next film. The director’s two children had reached their late teens, and he had found himself in what he calls a “looking-back phase” – poring over baby pictures, and reminiscing about watching the first sparks of their person­alities emerge.

His next film, he thought, would follow two of those sparks: a pair of souls-in-training who are having a pre-existential crisis, but decide to face their fraught and uncertain lives on Earth side by side. This was a strong idea with one obvious drawback; it felt an awful lot like Inside Out, in which Joy and Sadness – two emotions inside the head of an 11-year-old girl – learn to accept their differences and appreciate each other’s worth.

It was 2015, halfway through a decade at Pixar in which sequels had outnumbered original films by almost two to one. That creative change of direction had profoundly irked Docter, who had always gone out of his way to avoid repeating himself artistically, and took particular pride in the studio’s innovative early output. (When Docter took over as Pixar’s chief creative officer in 2018 after his predecessor John Lasseter’s departure over a series of MeToo-related “missteps”, any further sequels were instantly outlawed.)

And so Docter wrestled with his latest project, trying to find an angle that felt like genuinely new ground, but his last one hadn’t yet let go of him. Inside Out had become an awards season juggernaut, and went on to win a Golden Globe, a Bafta and an Oscar. It was the kind of success Docter had always dreamt of as his life’s crowning achievement, yet he returned to the studio oddly deflated.

“I fell in love with animation when I was nine, made my first film when I was 11, and started working professionally at 15,” he says on a Zoom call from his home close to Pixar’s headquarters outside San Francisco. Now 51, he has a cartoonist’s face, elastically expressive, and a voice that calls to mind Michael Keaton. “So it had always felt like my calling, and I think in the back of my head I’d always expected that once I’d achieved some arbitrary level of success, I’d find happiness and fulfilment, and all my anxieties would vanish.”

Instead, he continues, “I found myself thinking, ‘Wait a minute – what if that really was the be-all and end-all of my time here? And if so, what am I doing here still?’ ” Then it hit him. The soul in crisis he should be making a film about was his own.

Didn’t know TBS’s Pedro Martinez’s role in the 2003 Yankees-Red Sox ALCS brawl, disqualified him from ever criticizing anyone else for not following baseball’s “unwritten rules.” Martinez took major heat inside the VOS for daring to rip Gleyber Torres for stealing second base with the Yankees holding a six-run lead late in ALDS Game 1. Doubt the criticism will stop Martinez from hammering away. ... Joe Benigno’s exit question to Aaron Boone on FAN, a few hours before a critical ALDS Game 4, was strange. Benigno wanted to know if the manager thought his team would have played better “in an empty Yankee Stadium.” A perplexed Boone said the question was a “hypothetical” one that he didn’t need to deal with. ... On FAN’s Yankees playoff post game shows with Sweeny Murti, they actually air Rays audio. Nice. ... Didn’t know ESPN Radio’s play-by-play voice Dan Shulman was a poet. After Randy Arozarena took a strike in the third inning of Game 4, Shulman said: “It was 88. Straight. And across the plate.” Bravo!

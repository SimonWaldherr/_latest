"Dancing With the Stars" survived its first scoring malfunction drama last week, which lead to scenes of chaos on live TV as host Tyra Banks tried to sort out the botched finale.

Banks assured USA TODAY, and viewers again Monday night, that the correct celebrity (Anne Heche), was sent home amid the bedlam, chalked to a computer error.

Monday night's only tragedy was the fashion for the show's ’80s Night. There was a lot of big hair, three terrible mullets, bright colors and "Bachelorette" Kaitlyn Bristowe not only showed break-dance skills, she lost her skirt in the process.

Here's what went down before a truly "Desperate" ending.

Justina Machado put the splash back into 'Flashdance'

The “One Day at a Time” standout kicked off ’80s night in style in a teal outfit and bright pink leggings while jazz dancing to "Maniac" from "Flashdance."

She was already dancing like she never had before, then Machado shocked everyone by jumping onto a shadow-silhouetted chair for the stunning finale – a replay of the epic "Flashdance" water drop, a la Jennifer Beal.

Machado was soaked, but smiling. "He had to talk me into that," she said of partner Sasha Farber.

"You're a maniac, and I mean that in the best possible way," crowed judge Derek Hough. The judges rolled straight 8s. (Total score: 24/30)

Jesse Metcalfe didn't rule the world with his tango

"Desperate Housewives" star Metcalfe was looking for his breakout moment. It didn't come in his tango with pro Sharna Burgess to Tears for Fears' “Everybody Wants to Rule the World." He looked the part in an all-white suit and shoes along with a permed wig. But his missteps left the judges fretful.

"You went wrong, quite a few times," said dismayed judge Bruno Tonioli, who gave a tepid 6 score. Judge Carrie Ann Inaba was kinder, saying Metcalfe was "feeling the music for the first time," and giving a 7. His total score (19/30) left the star in peril, which would come back to haunt him.

'Selling Sunset' star bought the entire block from the New Kids

Chrishell Stause professed her undying love for New Kids on the Block and showed some suggestive moves in her cha cha to “You Got it (The Right Stuff)” with pro Gleb Savchenko. The reality star even pulled off the New Kids side-by-side solo dance moves. But mostly it was hot for a samba.

"Only those two can turn a cha cha into 'Dirty Dancing,' " said Tonioli by way of compliment. But he criticized some foot placement issues, giving a 7 with other middling scores. (Total score: 19/30)

Jeannie Mai danced to 'Like a Virgin' like it wasn't the very first time

“The Real” star paid respect to the icon of outrageousness, Madonna, dancing her jazz number with pro Brandon Armstrong to “Like a Virgin." Emerging from a pink, foam-filled bathtub, and fully in Madonna lace, Mai continued to impress with impossibly acrobatic twirls and a persistently radiant smile.

Inaba was wowed, saying Mai is the show's "most exciting performer. There's something about you that lights up." The judges lit up straight 8s. (Total score: 24/30)

Monica Aldama didn't let past tainted scoring affect her

The "Cheer" coach was the main victim of last week's craziness, having to be hauled back onto the dance floor to face elimination at the end due to the scoring error. She survived. But last week's episode shows how vulnerable the performer is with fans.

Aldama sought redemption, dancing the tango to Soft Cell's "Tainted Love" with mullet-wearing pro Val Chmerkovskiy. Far more stern than seductive, she kicked her legs out of a glam gown and glided across the dance floor.

"You were focused like a laser-guided missile," said Tonioli. "Even Val's mullet didn't distract you."

"We saved you last week, and you didn't disappoint," said Inaba, who bestowed Aldama's first 9 score. "Talk about redemption," said Banks. (Total score: 26/30)

A.J. McLean made his first prom, and was king

Backstreet Boy McLean admitted he never made his high school prom, doing boy-band global tour duty. He had his moment Monday in a tux and a ridiculous wig, waltzing with partner Cheryl Burke to Journey's slow-dance fave "Open Arms" in a faux gym dance floor setting.

The two ended up putting crowns on each other's head to close it off.

"The king and queen of the prom are crowned, because you are doing all the right things," said Tonioli, as the judges gave straight 8s. (Total score: 24/30)

Skai came back to Earth after her 10

After getting her first (and the season's first ) 10 score last week, Disney Channel star Skai Jackson and partner Alan Bersten went jazz dance to "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis & The News.

A little unfair to have ’80s night with Jackson, who was born in 2002. But she pulled off the energetic routine with hair-whipping, flips and lifts (with some shaky landings) with Bersten dressed as "Back the Future" star Doc Brown.

Jackson couldn't go back in time to the 10 score, however, as the judges' reviews were mixed, even as Inaba pointed out "moments of greatness." On an off night, Jackson pulled straight 8s. (Total score: 24/30)

Vernon Davis wigged out to Bon Jovi

Football star Davis was unrecognizable in a shoulder-length wig for his tango to Bon Jovi's "Livin' On a Prayer." But even as he professed to loving the tune, Davis came up tentative in the dance moves with some missed steps. Maybe it was the hair for the normally bald baller. "It is hot," Davis admitted afterward. "I have so much respect for women."

Hough actually pulled out football terms in his critique, calling for Davis to "attack" like he was in the "red zone." Davis scored straight 7s, which left him vulnerable. (Total score: 21/30).

Kaitlyn Bristowe showed moonwalking skills, lost her skirt

"The Bachelor" star vowed to show new moves Monday. And she did, kicking up her high heels and twirling her skirt on the dance floor, seemingly forgetting how "Dancing" played up her ballroom career-threatening ankle injury weeks ago.

Wearing nerd glasses, Bristowe's tango to Tiffany's "I Think We're Alone Now," ended with break-dance moves and partner Artem Chigvintsev whipping off her skirt (to reveal shorts). But wow, what a surprise moment.

"I did not see that coming at the end," said Inaba, asking the other judges, "Did you expect that?" Tonioli called it an "action-packed ’80s blockbuster. You never knew what was going to happen next." The judges gave Bristowe, who is already the season's highest-scoring dancer, lofty straight 9s. (Total score: 27/30)

Nelly dancing to DeBarge was unforgettable

Seeing the rapper rolling his arms to DeBarge's sappy "Rhythm of the Night" while wearing nerd glasses, a sleeveless, stone-washed denim jacket and a beaming smile – that is what makes "Dancing With the Stars" great.

Nelly's exacting samba with his ridiculously big-haired (wig) partner Danielle Karagach had the judges euphoric.

"That made me so happy," said Inaba. "I don't know what's going on, but it was yummy." The judges gave straight 8s. (Total score: 24/30)

Johnny Weir's bare feet brought the 10s

Olympic figure skater Weir seemed back on the ice rink, dancing a contemporary number to Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart" with partner Britt Stewart. One major difference was the idiosyncratic Weir didn't wear any shoes for the number. Nor did he bother to explain his bare feet.

Whatever, the whole thing brought Weir to his "happy place." The dance was so good that when Tonioli started to give a small critique among his praise, the crowd boo-ed. And it wasn't just fake audience noise. Someone was boo-ing.

"Take a bow," said Inaba, calling the dance "incredible." She and Hough gave perfect 10 scores (the first double 10 of the season), with Tonioli giving a 9. (Total score: 29/30)

Nev Schulman took on the mullet for a manic quickstep

"Catfish" star Schulman donned hot-pink pants that would have made David Lee Roth blush and wore the mullet of the night. His quickstep dance with partner Jenna Johnson to A-ha's "Take on Me" was so energetic, Schulman was panting all through the judges' comments. But he hit the steps.

Tonioli called it "exuberant," giving a 9 score. (Total score: 26/30)

There were no scoring screw-ups …

The faulty computers were fixed. Aldama was one of the first celebrities to safely leave the floor, and she didn't get called back.

In the end, footballer Davis and "Desperate" Metcalfe were left, the final two standing and in peril based on viewer votes and judges' scores.

It was up to the judges to decide who would be spared elimination, and who would go home.

Inaba and Tonioli ended the drama quickly, both voting to send Metcalfe home. No tie-breaker needed. Davis will be back in the lineup next week.

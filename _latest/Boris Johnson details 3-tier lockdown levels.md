Pubs will be shut down and boozing and non-essential travel banned in the worst-hit areas after England was plunged into a draconian three-tier lockdown.

Boris Johnson has officially confirmed a new system of Covid Local Alert Levels that will cover every village, town, city and region of England.

Officials tonight assigned every area in the country as Tier 1 (medium risk), Tier 2 (high) or Tier 3 (very high) due to soaring rates of coronavirus - and also hope to publish a postcode checker to see the rules in your area.

Liverpool City Region was hurled into Tier 3 instantly - with restrictions taking force on Wednesday - after fraught talks over the weekend left local leaders furious.

Tier 3 areas face dramatic restrictions going far beyond the local lockdowns that are already in force for more than 10million people.

Pubs and bars must shut in Tier 3 areas - but can stay open if they can operate as a restaurant. And venues are banned from serving alcohol unless it comes with a "substantial" meal.

Scroll down for the full rules for each tier and the full list of areas in each tier in England.

People in Tier 3 will be advised against travel in and out of their area - and urged not to stay overnight away from their area.

People from the rest of the UK will also be urged not to stay overnight in Tier 3 areas. But this will be guidance, not law.

Tier 3 restrictions will also ban meeting anyone from outside your household or support bubble - both indoors and in private gardens. This ban will also apply to any kind of hospitality or ticketed venue outdoors - such as beer gardens.

And people in Tier 3 areas will have their wedding receptions banned - though up to 15 will still be allowed at a ceremony.

Areas in Tier 3 will be able to impose extra local restrictions on top.

In Liverpool City Region this will mean the closure of leisure centres, gyms, betting shops and casinos.

There will be a long list of exemptions to these bans and rules in guidance to be released by the government.

Shielding won’t automatically resume for ‘extremely clinically vulnerable’ people in Tier 3. But a general update for those 2.2million people, who stayed indoors from March to August, is expected today or tomorrow.

People in Tier 2 areas will be banned from meeting anyone not in their household or support bubble indoors - as in the current local lockdowns.

But they can still meet outdoors as long as it's within the 'rule of six' - including in private gardens, which under local lockdowns is currently banned.

Tier 1 areas will reflect national rules, including the ’rule of six’, 10pm pub curfew and advice to work from home if you can.

Greater Manchester remained Tier 2 for now despite soaring virus rates after local leaders said the government scheme would leave minimum-wage workers destitute.

But worst-hit areas like Manchester, Nottingham and Newcastle could enter Tier 3 at any point in the future.

Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will all move from few restrictions into Tier 2.

And sources expect London to ramp up its restrictions by entering Tier 2 around the end of this week, or next week.

It is understood there will not be one single infection rate at which areas move from one tier to another.

Instead, any change in tier status will be worked out between local leaders, Public Health England and the Joint Biosecurity Centre. Previously they have also taken into account things like the growth rate of the disease and the number of people in hospital.

Tier 3 areas will have their rules reviewed at least every four weeks.

Workers in venues which are forcibly shut by the government will have two-thirds of their wages paid by the state from November 1.

But the new scheme will not support any workers in venues that have their takings slashed by the new restrictions, but are still technically allowed to remain open.

Instead those workers must rely on the Job Support Scheme - where they must work at least a third of their normal hours. The government will fund 22% of their normal wages but employers must pay 55%.

Announcing the measures in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister said he understood those "chafing" against the restrictions and "fatigued" about rules.

But he said "the bleak mathematics" means letting the virus rip would lead to an "intolerable death toll".

And it would cause such a huge strain on the NHS that "doctors and nurses would be simply unable to devote themselves to other treatments - cancer, heart disease and countless more."

He added: "We must act to save lives... I believe not to act would be unforgiveable. So I hope rapid progress can be made in the coming days."

But Labour leader Keir Starmer told the PM: "I am now deeply sceptical that the Government has actually got a plan to get control of this virus, to protect jobs or retain public trust."

He added it increasingly feels as if Boris Johnson is "several steps behind the curve".





The restrictions were agreed just hours before they were announced after a weekend of fraught talks with local leaders.

Tory council chiefs were among those who slammed the government for paying just 67% of staff wages - not 80% as in the original furlough scheme.

Measures were finally agreed this morning at a COBRA meeting with the four nations and Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram.

But hopes of having one set of rules for Tier 3 areas were dashed after the tense talks. Instead there will be a 'baseline' set of rules for all Tier 3 areas, followed by extra measures that local leaders can agree on top for each area.

It is understood the government is intending to publish a full list by the end of today of every area and what tier it is.

The government also intends to finally publish a postcode checker that will allow people to check the rules in their area.

It comes after medics showed stark evidence of how the virus is surging across England - despite being most common in the North West and North East.

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam admitted rates are worse in the north of England because the disease 'never dropped' as much as in the south.

Three Nightingale hospitals, in Sunderland, Harrogate and Manchester, are being "mobilised" once more.

Hospital cases in the places hardest hit in the UK have risen sevenfold in the past weeks.

Some are just four weeks away from matching the number of patients seen at the peak of the virus, medics warned today.

And across the UK, the NHS has more patients in hospital today that it did on the day the country went into lockdown, top medics have warned.

What is the three-tier lockdown system?

Mr Johnson unveiled the new coronavirus alert levels in a statement in the Commons on Monday.

Every area in England will be labelled as 'medium', 'high' or 'very high risk' - depending on the state of the virus.

Reports of a traffic-light style system were wide of the mark but the premise is the same.

The plan is an attempt to iron out discrepancies in local lockdown rules - which are widely seen as confusing.

It will also impose harder rules on parts of England where Covid-19 is spreading quickly.

Mr Johnson was also expected to hand more control to councils over contact-tracing after the privatised NHS Test and Trace failed to tell thousands to isolate.

How do I find out what tier I'm in?

A full run-down of local authority areas is expected to be published on Monday.

The Government will have an online postcode checker at gov.uk where you can find out about restrictions in your area and anywhere you might have to travel to.

The NHS Covid-19 app will also provide information about alert levels.

How long will the restrictions last for?

Areas under Tier 3 will be under the rules for up to four weeks.

Measures then have to be formally renewed.

It’s not yet clear how often or on what schedule areas will move from tier to tier.

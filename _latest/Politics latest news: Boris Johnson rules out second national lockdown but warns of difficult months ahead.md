Boris Johnson has ruled out another national lockdown, as he sets out the new system of local Covid Alert Levels in the House of Commons.

England will be ordered into "medium", "high" and "very high" alert levels under a new three-tier system of local restrictions

The Liverpool City Region faces the toughest local lockdown restrictions in England after being placed on a "very high" alert level, the Prime Minister said. That means household mixing will be banned indoors and in private gardens.

Pubs and bars will be closed unless they can operate as a restaurant. People will also be advised against travel in and out of the areas.

He did not confirm what would happen to other parts of the country, although local MPs have already confirmed that Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Leicester are among those to have escaped the worst of the new lockdown measures.

These regions will be placed in Tier 2 under the the Prime Minister's new traffic lights system, the Health Secretary has said. It is thought that will result in a ban on household mixing, but allow hospitality to continue to trading.

It is not known where London will fall, although reports suggest it could also be put in Tier 2.

Remaining MPs are expected to find out how their constituency will fare in a session with ministers tonight.

Meanwhile the Welsh Government is threatening to impose unilateral travel restrictions, with the UK Government expected only to issue guidance for those in hot spots.

The Prime Minister will give a press conference to the nation at 7pm.

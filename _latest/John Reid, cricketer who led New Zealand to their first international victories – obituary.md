John Reid, who has died aged 92, was one of the outstanding figures in the history of New Zealand cricket, both as a batsman and a bowler, while as captain in 34 successive Test matches between 1956 and 1965 he led his country to its first victories both at home and abroad.

This achievement was the more remarkable because the New Zealand team passed through a weak phase after the retirement of such players as Walter Hadlee, Mervyn Wallace and Martin Donnelly in the early 1950s. Often Reid stood alone as the outstanding performer.

His zestful talent for every aspect of the game gave promise of towering sixes, scattered stumps and tumbling catches. Always eager to attack, he was inclined neither to overrate nor to over-indulge the opposition.

Going out to bat he would walk with a somewhat bow-legged gait and brush his hair nervously with his glove before receiving his first ball. Once set, though, Reid combined a wonderful eye with immense strength, driving, hooking and cutting with explosive power.

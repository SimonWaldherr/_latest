  Black representation grows on TV - but diversity behind the scenes lags, UCLA report finds 
description: > 
  There's still a lot of work to do when it comes to proportionately representing people of color on TV, and particularly in powerful roles behind the camera, a new study shows.But there is clear progress being made: Black representation is growing on television.That's what the second part of UCLA's study "Hollywood Diversity: A Tale of Two Hollywoods," which focuses on TV, reports in a new study published Thursday.In fact, the UCLA analysis found the greatest overall racial and gender disparities were behind the camera.Most notably in the executive suite, there has been very little change since we began compiling data five years ago.

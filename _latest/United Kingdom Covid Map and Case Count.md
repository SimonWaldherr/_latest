There have been at least 617,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, according to Public Health England. As of Tuesday morning, 42,875 people had died. Due to a data entry error, nearly 16,000 people who tested positive between Sept. 25 and Oct. 2 were not recorded in the daily number of reported cases.

The Office for National Statistics also produces a weekly report on the number of deaths registered in the U.K. that mention Covid-19 on a death certificate. This figure, which includes deaths outside of hospitals, is many thousands of deaths higher than the reported daily death toll.

Britain has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe. Here’s where the number of cases and deaths are highest in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland:

In May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a conditional plan to ease Britain out of its seven-week lockdown. He said those who cannot work from home may return to work, and that people can freely exercise and spend time outdoors.

But by September, an uncharacteristically somber Mr. Johnson announced new restrictions to try to keep the second wave of infections now hitting the country from getting far worse through the fall and winter.

Across Britain, gatherings of more than six people are banned, with some exceptions. Pubs and restaurants must close at 10 p.m., people are encouraged to work from home and fines of 200 pounds ($255) are imposed on first-time offenders who break the rules on the size of gatherings or wearing face masks in public shops.

In England, Mr. Johnson announced a three-tier system to standardize restrictions across the country. Areas in the first tier uphold the current national restrictions. The second tier tightens measures and does not allow people to mix indoors with other households. In tier three, the "very high" alert areas or localities where transmission levels continue to rise, the government said it will assist local councils to establish additional measures, such as closing pubs, gyms and other nonessential businesses. Residents in tier three would also be advised against travel in and out of the area.

Scotland took an even more cautious approach in responding to the recent spike in cases: all pubs and restaurants in central Scotland will close, and across the rest of the country, hospitality services are only permitted to serve alcohol outdoors until 10 p.m. In Northern Ireland, the government has also made mask-wearing compulsory in taxis, banks, and for those working in retail shops.

How Cases Are Growing

During this video interview, IBF lightweight champion Teofimo Lopez explains why he doesn’t like comparisons to his big upcoming unification fight against Vasiliy Lomachenko to Floyd Mayweather vs Canelo Alvarez. Check out what he had to say below...

Lopez on his fight against Lomachenko being compared to Mayweather-Canelo:

“Lomachenko’s not Floyd. Two, I’m not Canelo...I know a lot of people want to [compare] to that...I think that’s everyone’s game plan and I think that’s the best thing I always love — that deep waters, right. People always wanna take me to deep waters. And the fact they don’t understand is that I live in deep waters. I’m a shark.

“Try to take me to deep waters and it just ends up becoming their downfall. And that’s why if this fight goes to the 12th round — I understand that Lomachenko may be a slow starter and he picks up as the rounds continue, but so do I. And I think this is definitely gonna be a chess match, a great fight, and I don’t look at it as Mayweather-Canelo, and if it is, I’m Mayweather.”

  Callout Collection: Who UFC on ESPN+ 38 winners want next – and how likely they'll get them 
description: > 
  Wants to fight: Khamzat ChimaevThe callout: “Does he want to fight me?We’ll fight there!”The reality: From being the hunter, it seems Khamzat Chimaev is becoming the hunted, with people now beginning to call him out.However, Jun Yong Park’s grinning call to scrap with “The Wolf” will only pay off if the UFC opts to take a slow-play approach to Chimaev’s career.However, if the UFC fancies repeating the trick and running two Chimaev fights in relatively quick succession, they may see Park as a potential option.It’s a nice callout, and one that will get him a few column inches during this weekend’s recaps, but the Chimaev ship has likely already sailed.

<p><strong>The callout: </strong>&#8220;Does he want to fight me? Where is he? I saw him around here somewhere. Yeah, we&#8217;ll go find a nightclub somewhere. We&#8217;ll fight there!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The reality:&#160;</strong>From being the hunter, it seems Khamzat Chimaev is becoming the hunted, with people now beginning to call him out. However, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/jun-yong-park">Jun Yong Park</a>&#8217;s grinning call to scrap with &#8220;The Wolf&#8221; will only pay off if the UFC opts to take a slow-play approach to Chimaev&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>The general view following Chimaev&#8217;s three octagon wins so far is that he&#8217;s ready to move up and face some of the established names, at either 170 or 185 pounds, so on the face of it a fight with a largely unheralded prospect like Park doesn&#8217;t seem like the fight to make. However, if the UFC fancies repeating the trick and running two Chimaev fights in relatively quick succession, they may see Park as a potential option.</p>
<p>More likely, though, is the UFC will put Chimaev against someone with more cache to his name, and a fight with someone like Neil Magny or Stephen Thompson would seem more realistic at this point.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice callout, and one that will get him a few column inches during this weekend&#8217;s recaps, but the Chimaev ship has likely already sailed.</p>

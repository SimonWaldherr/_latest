  Angle Calls John Cena WWE's GOAT; Undertaker Thanks Fans; Kross Injury Update 
description: > 
  Angle Refers to Cena as WWE's GOATWWE Hall of Famer Kurt Angle had some great battles with John Cena during his career, and there is no question that Cena earned the Olympic gold medalist's respect.Angle and Cena had many more battles after that in both tag team and singles matches, and they always seemed to have great in-ring chemistry.The respect between Angle and Cena was so great, in fact, that Cena presented Angle for induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017.Cena and WWE will always be synonymous with each other, which is likely a big reason why Angle puts Cena on such a high pedestal.An Undertaker match or appearance at Survivor Series 2020 next month would be fitting since Survivor Series is where it all began for The Deadman.

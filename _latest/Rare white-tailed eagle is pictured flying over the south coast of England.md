(Haliaeetus albicilla) disappeared from the UK during the early 20th century but has been brought back from the brink.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The species is the largest bird of prey in the UK with a wingspan pushing eight feet (2.4 metres) and a body length of up to three feet (90cm).&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It suffered huge declines in Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries and it is still persecuted by gamekeepers because it feeds on birds, rabbits and hares.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, numbers are now growing after the legally-protected

the 1970s and is&#160;now mostly found in Scotland and Ireland, but scarcely over English land.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The present population, including the new sightings over

where there are now over 130 breeding pairs &#8211; Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation was granted licences by Natural England and Scottish Natural Heritage to begin an English reintroduction.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the UK white tailed eagles are strictly protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is an offence to intentionally take, injure or kill a white-tailed eagle or to take, damage or destroy its nest, eggs or young.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also an offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb the birds close to their nest during the breeding season.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Violation can result in a fine of up to &#163;5000 and/or a prison sentence of up to six months.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite this, threats still exist. The main current threat in the UK is persecution, predominantly through poisoning, something which has overshadowed the otherwise successful reintroduction programmes.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Illegal egg collection remains an additional threat.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Re-establishing a population of the species on the south coast helps to restore 'a lost species',&#160;Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The project will help to link populations in Scotland and Ireland with those in the Netherlands and France.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Scotland the best places to see white-tailed eagles are Mull, Skye and parts of the northwest Highlands.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many parts of southern England are capable of supporting breeding and wintering White-tailed Eagles, but the Isle of Wight was considered the most suitable location for the reintroduction.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is the last known breeding site of the species in southern England and is located close to highly suitable foraging areas in the Solent and surrounding estuaries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also has numerous potential nesting sites in woods and cliffs and quiet areas for immature birds.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it is well positioned to facilitate the dispersal of eagles both west and east along the coast to sites such as Poole Harbour in Dorset and Pagham Harbour in West Sussex.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#160;Source:&#160;Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation/RSPB</p> <p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_1"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

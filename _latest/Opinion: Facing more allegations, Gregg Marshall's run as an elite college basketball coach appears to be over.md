<div><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If you were Gregg Marshall, hunkered down in the metaphorical castle he&#8217;s built at Wichita State while the entire narrative of his career collapses around him, you would almost certainly be asking: Why now?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Why are former players at not just one but two schools publicly accusing him of abusive behavior, <a href="https://theathletic.com/news/wichita-state-gregg-marshall-behavior-winthrop/sywEo0Ght0pr" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">as outlined in new reporting Tuesday in The Athletic</a> about Marshall&#8217;s time at Winthrop? Why is the coaching style that brought him from obscurity to a Final Four and was rewarded with wealth beyond belief suddenly inappropriate and over the line? Why is the mob only coming for him now after 22 years as a college head coach?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It must be stunning and confusing to Marshall to see his treatment of players exposed now, after dragging Winthrop to the NCAA Tournament seven times in nine years and then turning Wichita State into a national brand, churning out a lot of good basketball players and good citizens along the way.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But even if Marshall hasn&#8217;t changed, the rest of us have. And if there&#8217;s corroboration to the growing pile of allegations, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/aac/2020/10/09/gregg-marshall-investigation-wichita-state-misconduct/5934820002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">including a damning account initially published Oct. 9</a> by Stadium, Wichita State would be foolish to keep him &#8212; if only because he can no longer credibly run a program in 2020.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Forget for a moment that his alleged behavior is just wrong &#8212; choking an assistant, racially-charged taunts toward players, language so demeaning that former players still resent him years later &#8212; having it exposed to the public will cripple his ability to recruit, to relate, to lead. And no amount of university-level enablement, support from billionaire booster Charles Koch or ambiguity resulting from an investigation can make that stain go away.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In that sense, calling for Marshall to be fired is either too obvious or too redundant. Even if he keeps his job &#8212; and the fact Wichita State hasn&#8217;t even suspended him yet suggests he&#8217;ll get the kid-glove treatment to the bitter end &#8212; his ability to do it effectively is already done.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Wichita State head coach Gregg Marshall yells during a February game against Tulsa."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Who would knowingly send their son to play for a coach who, according to former Winthrop players who spoke with The Athletic, asked a player if he was &#8220;stupid or just retarded?&#8221; Who would knowingly send their son to play for a coach who told a player he&#8217;d &#8220;send him back to Africa&#8221; or frequently used a derogatory term for female anatomy to address players?&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That&#8217;s not what anyone should want their children to endure, and it&#8217;s certainly not coaching.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But maybe to Marshall, it was. Try to look at it through his eyes. You&#8217;re talking about somebody who started as an under-talented, undersized player at Randolph-Macon College in the early 1980s who only stood out because of his tenacity &#8212; and his temper.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In fact, a 2012 profile of Marshall in the Wichita Eagle detailed his ability to get under the skin of his teammates to the point where they sometimes came to blows and a childhood where he always seemed like he had something to prove.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">More Marshall:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/aac/2020/10/13/gregg-marshall-wichita-state-hoops-coach-denies-abuse-allegations/3646509001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Wichita State coach denies abuse allegations levied by ex-player</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">NCAA executive:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2020/10/16/ncaa-executive-sports-covid-related-woes-could-linger-into-2023/3682211001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">College sports' financial woes could last into 2023</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For Marshall, those traits never failed to advance his career. Maybe the proverbial chip on the shoulder that helped him realize every bit of his own basketball ability and separated him from the scores of anonymous coaches who never made it big was intentionally woven into his own coaching philosophy.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Or maybe he&#8217;s just a dude with anger management problems that no administrator ever had the guts to address with him. Colleges in particular tend to conveniently ignore those kinds of problems when the wins are coming, and they can get away with it for the most part because the line between accountability and abuse is often thin or vague enough to ignore.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But little by little, that line has moved over the years. Not just because it&#8217;s a better, healthier way to treat people (and college athletes in particular) but because coaching through fear is not as effective as it once was.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Just look at the last three coaches in college basketball to win national titles: Tony Bennett, Jay Wright, Roy Williams. These are not your stereotypical raving lunatics on the sidelines. Even in college football, the model has moved away from the Bear Bryant wannabes and toward someone like Clemson&#8217;s Dabo Swinney, who works tirelessly to create a positive culture that elite players want to be part of.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If Bobby Knight were coming up in coaching today, he would have either figured out how to control his worst impulses or he would have never made it. But at least Knight, for all his faults, had a lot of former players willing to stand up for him.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Where&#8217;s that support been for Marshall over the last 11 days since the numerous accusations of bullying behavior came to light? Though Marshall has denied being demeaning or abusive and some former players have said his coaching style helped them, there hasn&#8217;t been a peep from Fred VanVleet, Ron Baker or Landry Shamet &#8212; the three biggest names from his Wichita State tenure.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Maybe Marshall is such a towering figure at Wichita State that he will be allowed to ride this out, pledge to do better and try to hit the reset button on a program that has been spinning out of control since seven players left via transfer after last season. In college sports, no amount of cravenness can really surprise us anymore.&#160; &#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But for all intents and purposes, Marshall&#8217;s run as one of college basketball&#8217;s most fascinating figures is over. Why now? Because the sad reality in college sports is you can get away with exactly the amount of trouble you&#8217;re worth. Until his former players started speaking up, Marshall was worth it. Just like that, he&#8217;s not.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Even if Wichita State doesn&#8217;t realize it over the next few days, they will soon enough.&#160;</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/nba/2020/03/22/nba-draft-college-basketball-underclassmen-declare-early/2893544001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

  Orionid Meteor Shower set to dazzle stargazers this week with up to 25 shooting stars an hour 
description: > 
  This week stargazers will be able to see up to 25 shooting stars per hour fly across the night sky as the Orionid Meteor Shower puts on its annual show.This cosmic event happens when Earth passes through stream of debris left behind Comet Halley â€“ the parent comet of the Orionid shower.You should be able to see the shooting stars from whatever direction you look, but they will appear to come from the constellation of Orion in the south east.Stargazers are in for a treat this month when hundreds of shooting stars light up the sky during an Orionid meteor shower.They're not the strongest of the annual meteor showers, but you should see up to 25 per hour during the peak on October 21.

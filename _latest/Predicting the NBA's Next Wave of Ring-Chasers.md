A rich collection of points, rebounds, assists and other trackable success measures can grant one's stead in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, but nothing quite cements one's legacy like a championship.

A championship can be an elusive and desperate icon to an athlete reaching his or her latter years. When we trace the history of some of the greats who fell short, we can also track strategic attempts to achieve it. Karl Malone and Gary Payton joined Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles. Clyde Drexler linked up with Hakeem Olajuwon in Houston. Charles Barkley (who was traded) followed suit in Houston.

From Steve Nash to Dwight Howard to David West to Kevin Durant, there are countless examples of Hall of Fame-caliber players who chased the ring. They aren't alone. A ring can do more than just cement one's legacy for long-tenured journeymen who have fallen off NBA teams' radar. The spotlight can bring with it the opportunity to resurrect one's standing following regression or a return from a catastrophic injury.

Here are the five journeymen most likely to chase a ring in 2020-21.

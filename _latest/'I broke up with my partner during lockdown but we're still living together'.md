We asked readers to tell us how coronavirus has changed their lives, for better or for worse. One reader shared how the pandemic caused her relationship to break down and why it's been impossible for her to move on.

I met my partner in 2013 when we worked in an office together in London. Two years into our relationship, we decided to take the leap and move in together. We bought our own flat just as he started his own business.

We both had very busy lives, so it was easy to ignore the issues in our relationship before lockdown. I worked long hours, had a very long commute and a very active social life. When all of that was taken away in March it really put our relationship under a magnifying glass.

We've always differed in what we wanted or expected from living together. I'm very social and would want to be together as much as possible, while he values his own space and would want time alone away from everyone. I filled this void by keeping busy and seeing friends, but I knew I was running away from the issue rather than facing up to it.

But I couldn’t escape the differences during lockdown. I would want to do activities together, such as playing a board game and he wouldn’t, preferring to pass the time on his own. We realised that ultimately we have nothing in common, and when everything was stripped away, neither of us were happy – or truly wanted to be with each other. We had stayed together through habit and weren't actually in love at all and the more time that passed, the more it was obvious that we were wrong for each other.

Ultimately, the desire to end our relationship came from him. He was tired of fighting for the relationship and in April we sat down one day and he let me speak freely about how I really felt. As I spoke, he didn’t interrupt me to point out why we should continue with the relationship. I didn't think I would have had the courage to be so honest with myself and him, but lockdown pushed me to be brave about admitting how I felt.

After breaking up we continued to live together, albeit in separate bedrooms, as my partner was put on furlough and couldn’t afford to move out. Initially it was all very amicable. We decided to remain friends and make the best of the situation. But things have deteriorated over the past five months.

It’s not been like a normal breakup at all. I usually like to give myself space from a stressful situation, but it feels like there’s nowhere anyone can run to during a pandemic. The usual rituals of a separation to make it final in my mind never happened – dividing up belongings and allowing myself to grieve; these were on hold whilst we were stuck in our limbo.

Even though we are in different rooms, I’m sure we can both “feel” when we’re in the house together, and it’s not emotionally healthy.

Our finances have entirely complicated the situation. We cannot sell the house we have together and he is not prepared to sign over the deeds to me. We remortgaged last year to pay off debt and do renovations, so the property is in negative equity – which means selling isn't an option for us. The flat is in my hometown, so he has agreed that I can stay here and he will move out, but we can't agree on a time frame.

He wants to remain living together until he has saved up enough money to put a deposit on another property, which could take several years, whereas I don't feel I can start to heal emotionally until we are completely separated. Both of us want to meet other people, get married, and have children, so to imagine this situation continuing is unbearable.

I’d love to meet somebody and fall in love properly, to get married and have children – I just can’t see myself being able to heal until we are not living together.

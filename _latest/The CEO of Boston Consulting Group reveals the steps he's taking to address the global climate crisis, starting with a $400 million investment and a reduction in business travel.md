Boston Consulting Group is taking steps to address climate change.

Rich Lesser, the firm's global CEO and chairman, told Business Insider that the company planned to reduce its climate impact from business travel, which represents more than 80% of its total footprint, by at least 30% per full-time employee by 2025.

Lesser shared why the firm announced its climate agenda during a pandemic, what it means for the company's business-travel budget, and the leadership lessons he learned along the way.

Rich Lesser, the global CEO and chairman of Boston Consulting Group, has worked on some big projects during his 32 years at the firm.

Lesser joined BCG in 1988 as a consultant. He advised organizations on leadership, strategy, operations, and large transformation projects. He spearheaded operations for the firm's New York metropolitan, North America, and South America divisions for 12 years before he was appointed CEO in 2013.

Under Lesser's leadership, the consulting firm worked on 700 social-impact projects with over 450 organizations in 2019. In fact, BCG works with 50% of its largest clients on social-impact topics such as global health issues and humanitarian response.

Lesser's next project as CEO is tackling climate change. In an interview with Business Insider, Lesser said BCG has a goal to have net-zero climate impact by 2030. The firm recently announced a $400 million investment over the next decade to address the effects of climate change. As part of this investment, the company is partnering with organizations like the World Economic Forum, the World Wildlife Fund, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

The firm plans to reduce direct energy and electricity emissions by 90% per full-time employee by 2025. BCG started using renewable electricity in 2019, he said.

He added that the consultancy would cut back on business travel, which represents more than 80% of its total carbon footprint, by at least 30% per full-time employee by 2025, with more changes to follow. Discussions around how the firm can reduce its carbon footprint has been a hotly debated topic among BCG's partners and leaders for a number of years now, Lesser said.

"We all agreed that we needed to do something about this, but we just didn't know how to, especially with travel," he added.

The pandemic added more urgency for the firm to address its climate agenda. Business Insider caught up with Lesser to discuss the firm's climate agenda, what it means for the company's business-travel budget, and leadership lessons during the pandemic.

Taking a stand on climate change

When did BCG start having conversations on climate change and sustainability?

We started talking about helping the climate probably four or five years ago, and we decided that we need to make commitments about BCG's carbon footprint in late 2018. At that point, we announced to be carbon-neutral, and we have been since 2018. This means that in addition to reducing our climate impact, we have compensated for the remaining impact.

That was a good holding place to be at the end of 2018, given where the world was and given that we were early in the journey. But soon after, we recognized it wasn't a sufficient step. There are ways we quickly and dramatically affected our scope. One example is that we fully transitioned to buying renewable electricity in 2019.

What was trickier is figuring out how we could impact our travel footprint because our commitments are to our clients, and a part of that is to be there with them. We were sorting that out in 2019. And by the last quarter, we aligned to a substantial reduction in our own travel footprint per employee. It would take some years, but we're confident that 2025 would be doable.

You delayed the announcement for BCG's climate agenda for five months. Were you concerned that you wouldn't be able to deliver this commitment, given the fact that your company is in cost-cutting mode and we're going through a global health crisis?

We hesitated at two points in time.

We hesitated in January because we weren't as confident to commit to the world. We felt kind of uncertain because it's such a big challenge to figure out.

We hesitated in April, which was our original target announcement date because we thought it'd just seem out of place to focus on a climate agenda in the middle of a crisis and a global shutdown. The pandemic hit, and we shut down all our office operations and travel.

Very quickly though, we discovered that our ability to work remotely with clients go far beyond our expectations.

Is permanently cutting travel part of your climate goal?

There are two major components of our travel.

The main one is client travel. Before the pandemic, our teams were spending a lot of time together, and a lot of the time it's wherever the client is. That contributes to a big chunk of our emissions. But another component to this is our internal company travel, too, because we're just so global. We used to do global meetings together, and people are constantly flying back and forth.

We announced a 30% reduction, not a 90% reduction because we still think our teams will need to spend time with clients. We think there's no need to be there every single week with the whole team, and it'll be possible to have part of the team there and the other half on Zoom. We will still have global partner meetings where everyone comes together, but we may not do it as frequently.

Leading from home

Now seven months into the pandemic, how has leading the company remotely been for you?

I would've never guessed in January that I could do my job without living on an airplane. I was traveling probably 70% of the time. I was flying for at least three weeks each month to different countries, and I was fine with that.

And yet, I spend more time talking to CEOs around the world now than I ever did before because everyone is happy to do a 30-minute Zoom. Our meetings use to always depend on flying or when we're going to be in town to meet in person.

But now I can "visit" the Middle East team in the morning, the Asia team last at night, and the Europe and US team in between. I feel like I can travel around the world from my dining-room table.

This technology collapses hierarchy. BCG is not so hierarchical. But even in a place that tries to be nonhierarchical, it's now enhanced and you can meet with everybody at once.

During online meetings, I'm also seeing people who are closer to me in proximity, which is so much better than trying to connect with people in a giant conference room. Meetings have become so much more inclusive because we can invite more people to meetings regardless of who anyone's direct report is, and we don't have to worry about stuffing 20 people into a room or flying people who don't really have to be there physically.

I don't think I would ever reopen everything again. I don't think I'd ever go back to the way I did the job because it was so inefficient. And I knew it was inefficient. I just thought there was no other way to do it.

How are your employees feeling? How are they adjusting to remote work?

It's mixed. I think they're appreciative of the company's focus in keeping everyone safe, and I think their pride in the company is high. But the mixed part is how it feels day to day in their lives.

We hire a lot of young people, and they're early on in their careers. Part of what they want is to work on great problems, be in the room with other talented people who are more senior, and learn from clients by traveling the world. This idea of just being alone often in a cramped apartment and not getting some of the richer experiences that go beyond the work that you do â€” that part is hard.

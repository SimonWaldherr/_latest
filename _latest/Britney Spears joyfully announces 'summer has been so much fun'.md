Britney continued, 'I learned so much, I laughed so much, I swam so much.'

'But the most important thing that I did learn is that life has so many spontaneous gifts at each moment.'

'Sometimes we need to learn how to slow down and how to embrace them all."

The Baby... One More Time songstress concluded, 'Anyways, I hope your Summer was as good as mine, and God bless you all.'

Baby steps: Britney's joyful posts come after some ugly statements made by her own legal team

Britney's joyful post comes after some ugly statements made by her own legal team.

Attorney Sam Ingham said last Wednesday in a hearing that the Stronger singer's current mental state is that of a patient in a coma.

Ingham said the ...Baby One More Time hitmaker was unable to sign a sworn declaration in the case surrounding her conservatorship after the judge probed the singer's request to have a co-conservator join her father Jamie Spears in the arrangement, TMZ reported.

Fan love: The situation around her conservatorship has prompted Spears fans to rally around the #FreeBritney movement, which supports the singer's independence from the strict rules around the legal agreement. Fans are seen outside of a September 16 hearing above

Ingham said the Grammy-winning singer was not able to sign a declaration that would state her side of the issue. He clarified that while she is not literally in a coma, she is not able at this time to consent to a legal arrangement.

Ingham noted that attorneys can speak on behalf of comatose patients, according to the outlet. The judge in the case set a later date to address the issue.

Spears doesn't want to perform again, her lawyer said, leading to talk that the singer herself has not yet stated to the court what her career plans are moving forward. Ingham told the court that Jaime is pushing for Britney to continue recording and performing music.

Objections: Last month, Britney told the court she objected to her father Jamie's attempt to rehire estate manager Andrew Wallet, who she said was 'uniquely unsuited' and overpaid in his previous stint working for the family. Mr. Spears is seen in 2008 above

Last month, Britney told the court she objected to her father Jamie's attempt to rehire estate manager Andrew Wallet, who she said was 'uniquely unsuited' and overpaid in his previous stint working for the family, TMZ reported.

Wallet had worked for the family from 2008 to 2019 in a co-conservator capacity, Britney said, adding she had 'difficult budgetary choices going forward' and could not afford his services. She noted that he made millions in the past off of his work with the family.

Jamie later told the court that Britney had not portrayed the situation accurately in her complaint to the court.

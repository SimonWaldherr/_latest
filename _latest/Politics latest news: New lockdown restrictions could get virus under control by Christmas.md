Local leaders are still scratching their heads over how the latest lockdown will affect hospitality firms, despite "intensive" discussions with ministers and officials this weekend.

Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said they still had not received confirmation of the difference between a restaurant and gastropub is in terms of where will have to close.

He told BBC Breakfast: "That's something that the Government are still working the details of. I think you'd have to ask them for the details of what they believe the difference is because it did confuse some of us."

Asked about the closure of gyms, he said: "It would appear to me that some of these things - we asked for the evidence of course - some of these things are a judgment call.

"Our directors of public health have looked at this and they didn't push back greatly against the list (of places to close) and all we need to do now is if the Government can provide us with that scientific evidence that says that there are some outbreaks in gyms and other things that are on the list then we have to accept that.

"If not of course we'll be asking for them to release those restrictions as soon as they possibly can."

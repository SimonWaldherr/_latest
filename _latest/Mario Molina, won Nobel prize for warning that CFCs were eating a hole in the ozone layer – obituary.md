Mario Molina, who has died aged 77, was a Mexican-born chemist who shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with Paul Crutzen of the Max Planck Institute and Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine, for their discovery that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer.

In the early 1970s CFCs, used as refrigeration fluids and propellants for aerosol-spray products, were seen as an industrial success story. Engineered to be chemically inert, these synthetic chemicals were thought to be safe.

In 1972, however, Rowland attended a lecture by the British scientist James Lovelock, the inventor of an instrument with which he had detected CFCs in air over the Atlantic. Lovelock was convinced the chemicals were harmless, but Rowland suspected they might not be at high altitudes. He and Molina set out to investigate.

They theorised that solar radiation causes CFCs to decompose in the stratosphere (from about eight to 50 km above the Earth’s surface), releasing atoms of fluorine, chlorine and chlorine monoxide. These, they argued, could destroy large numbers of molecules in the ozone layer which protects the earth from solar radiation that causes skin cancer, crop damage and other problems.

Building on work by the atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen, they calculated that if CFC use continued unchanged, the ozone layer would be depleted within decades.

In 1974, when they published their research in the journal Nature, it was dismissed by leading figures in the chemical industry, the president of one company even suggesting that the research had been “orchestrated by the Ministry of Disinformation of the KGB’’.

However, the strength of their case was confirmed by the US National Academy of Sciences in 1976, and in 1978 aerosols containing CFCs were banned in the US, followed by a handful of other countries.

But doubts remained, and a Nasa satellite measuring ozone levels provided no evidence of depletion – due to the fact, discovered years later, that its computers had been programmed to discard very low figures as being spurious.

In 1985, however, scientists working for the British Antarctic Survey announced the discovery of a significant thinning in the ozone layer above the South Pole, proving that the danger identified by Rowland and Molina was real. Their measurements showed 40 per cent less ozone than had been detected 20 years earlier.

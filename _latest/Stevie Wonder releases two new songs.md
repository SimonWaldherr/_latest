(CNN) Stevie Wonder released two new songs Tuesday with the launch of his new label, So What the Fuss Records.

The legendary recording artist held a virtual press conference Tuesday to announce his new music, marketed and distributed by Republic Records, which is part of Universal Music Group. The move marks a break from Wonder's nearly 60-year career with Motown.

"Even though I have left Motown, I never leave Motown," Wonder said. "That's Detroit. So I'm sure that we can figure out how we can do some things at Motown."

Wonder was just 11 years old when Motown first signed him to a contract in 1961.

"Where Is Our Love Song" features Gary Clark Jr. and "Can't Put It in The Hands of Fate" features Rapsody, Cordae, Chika and Busta Rhymes.

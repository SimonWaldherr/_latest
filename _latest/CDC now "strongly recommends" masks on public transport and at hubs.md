<p>The Trump administration has thus far declined to issue any national mandate on face coverings, opting to leave such rules to state and local leaders to determine.

Wide use of masks especially helps protect those at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 as well as workers who frequently come into close contact with other people (e.g., in airports, seaports or other docks, bus terminals, and train stations)."</p>

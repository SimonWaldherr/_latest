France is to enforce 9pm to 6am curfews on a string of cities including Paris for up to six weeks, President Emmanuel Macron announced on Wednesday night, as Europe struggles to stem spiralling Covid infection rates.

Mr Macron said: "We are stuck with (the virus) until summer 2021." Those who fail to respect the closures face €135 fines.

The French local lockdowns came as EU countries ratcheted up restrictions in the hope of avoiding all-out lockdown and the risk of economic devastation.

In a primetime TV interview, Mr Macron said that with 20,000 new cases per day and 200 admissions to intensive care per day, “We are in what people call the second wave…We must take stricter measures”.

“It would be disproportionate to place the entire country back into lockdown but yes, what they call a curfew is a pertinent measure,” he said.

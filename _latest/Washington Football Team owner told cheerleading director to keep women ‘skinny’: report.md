The owner of the Washington Football Team threatened to kill the organization’s cheerleading coach if he didn’t keep the women “skinny with big tits,” a new report alleges.

Donald Wells, who served as coach from 1997 to 2009, told The Washington Post that team owner Dan Snyder made the nasty remark at a 2004 charity event where the squad performed.

“You better keep them skinny with big tits or I’ll f—ing kill you,” Wells alleged Snyder threatened him.

The revelation comes three months after the newspaper alleged that R-rated outtakes from swimsuit calendar shoots featuring the cheerleaders had been turned into lewd video compilations for Snyder’s enjoyment.

Snyder has denied any knowledge of the videos.

The videos showed some of the cheerleaders’ exposed nipples as they shifted positioning and included footage of two women whose pubic areas were covered only by body paint, The Washington Post reported.

Each video was set to classic-rock hits by the Rolling Stones and U2 — bands Snyder said were his favorite in a 2011 interview.

“I don’t think they viewed us as people. They viewed us as replaceable objects,” Chastity Evans, who was on the team’s squad for five seasons and who appeared in the unofficial 2008 video, is quoted in The Washington Post’s most recent story.

Contracts for the cheerleaders from 2008 to 2010, meanwhile, include a strict code-of-conduct, stipulating the women could be canned for posting “inappropriate” online content or appearing nude or seminude in “tasteless” films, videos or photographs, the report said.

“I would have hoped the team, because they held us to these high standards, would treat us with respect and uphold the same standards,” Evans told the paper.,

“Instead, they violated our trust with what sounds like a soft porn video.”

Some of the ex-cheerleaders also told the paper they feared that the unauthorized outtakes videos were still out there.

“I’m going to have two grown sons at some point, and what are they going to find on the internet — some mom porn?” said Lee-Ann Campbell.

Last month, attorneys Lisa Banks and Debra Katz — who are representing 12 of the cheerleaders — notified Snyder of their intent to sue him and the team over the lewd videos.

This week, the team agreed to a request from the attorneys for an “independent forensic investigation” to secure any copies of the videos that might still exist on its internal computer systems.

Wells, the former cheerleading director, said he wished he could have done more to protect the women.

He said he recently told Banks about the alleged threatening encounter with Snyder.

“I would never have told anyone about that if it weren’t for the revelation that the videos were created of my cheerleaders without their knowledge,” he told the Washington Post. “I was embarrassed and scared if I said anything I might be fired.”

Snyder didn’t respond to a request from the Post about Wells’ claim.

In a statement to the Washington Post, the team said that it is “examining its historical practices and behaviors.”

“We take the criticisms of our cheerleading program seriously and we remain committed to reviewing all programs thoroughly.”

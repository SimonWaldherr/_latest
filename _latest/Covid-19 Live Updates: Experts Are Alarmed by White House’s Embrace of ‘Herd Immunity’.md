Cases have been detected in nearly every country around the world, and at least 1.1 million people have died.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Officials are desperate to avoid a second economically damaging blanket lockdown, and are instead seeking to tighten restrictions in a more precise fashion. Here&#8217;s the latest.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Ireland</strong> will be imposing its highest level of restrictions starting on Wednesday night, Prime Minister Michael Martin announced on Monday. Nonessential businesses will be mandated to close, restaurants and pubs will be limited to takeout, and people will not be allowed to travel more than five kilometers (three miles) from their homes. Schools and construction sites will remain open, however, the public broadcaster <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rte.ie/news/coronavirus/2020/1019/1172397-coronavirus-ireland/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RTE reported</a>. The restrictions, which will remain in effect for six weeks, come after the country set new daily case records four times in the past week. &#8220;If we pull together over the next six weeks we will be able to celebrate Christmas in a meaningful way,&#8221; Mr. Martin said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Spain</strong>, the region of Navarre announced on Monday the country&#8217;s most drastic regional measures yet to contain the second wave. As of Thursday, Navarre will stop its residents from leaving their region except for work or emergency reasons. It will also close for 15 days its bars and restaurants, and force all shops, sports venues and other establishments to close by 9 p.m. The measures come after Navarre reported an average of 945 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past 14 days, three times the national average.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Austria</strong>, which reported 1,121 daily cases of the virus on Monday, announced new limits on the number of people who could meet privately starting Friday: six indoors and 12 outdoors. The country has reported nearly 10,000 cases in the past week, more than at any time in March, when the government imposed a nationwide lockdown. The restrictions were lifted over the summer as numbers dropped and the country sought to attract tourists, an important source of income for the alpine nation.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Italy</strong>, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that mayors will have the power to close streets or squares where people tend to gather after 9 p.m., while restaurants, bars and pubs will be allowed to serve seated customers &#8212; up to six per table &#8212; until midnight. Drinking outside of restaurants or bars will be permitted only until 6 p.m., and gaming and betting halls will close at 9 p.m. Italy has so far fared better than its European counterparts, but infections have been rising in recent weeks, with a record 11,705 new cases reported on Sunday. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">France</strong> imposed a nightly curfew in nine cities, including Paris, over the weekend, and asked people throughout the country to limit gatherings to six people to halt an alarming spike in cases. On Monday, the office of President Emmanuel Macron announced that the first lady, Brigitte Macron, was in quarantine after being exposed to someone who had tested positive. Ms. Macron has not shown any symptoms, the office said in a statement.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Slovenia&#8217;s</strong> government declared a 30-day state of emergency after cases of the virus more than doubled in the past week, Reuters reported. The government will ban movement between regions that have been most affected by the pandemic and introduce a nightly curfew beginning at 9 p.m. starting Monday, Interior Minister Ales Hojs said at a news conference. Mr. Hojs said that all public and religious events would be banned, and that the number of people allowed to gather would be reduced to six from 10. Slovenia has reported 4,845 coronavirus cases in the past week, a spike from 2,255 cases the week before.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Britain</strong> has reported an average of nearly 17,000 new cases a day over the past week, according to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">New York Times database</a>, with almost a thousand new daily cases in Wales.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Wales</strong> will enter a national lockdown starting Friday night, the country&#8217;s first minister, Mark Drakeford, announced on Monday. The &#8220;firebreak&#8221; lockdown, which will last until Nov. 9, will require residents to remain at home and force pubs, restaurants and nonessential shops to close. Mr. Drakeford said &#8220;there are no easy choices in front of us&#8221; and called the lockdown &#8220;our best chance of regaining control of the virus&#8221; and avoiding strain on the National Health Service.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">About 2.3 million of the 3.1 million people in Wales were already living under local lockdowns. and the country has effectively shut its borders to travel from other parts of Britain.</p><p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And officials in <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Bucharest</strong>, the Romanian capital, announced that schools, theaters and indoor dining will be closed for at least two weeks, and that masks will become mandatory in all public spaces. The city reported on Sunday that the virus rate over the previous 14 days had exceeded three cases per 1,000 residents, a red line for imposing stricter rules. After keeping the virus largely in check during the initial months of the pandemic, Romania has seen cases triple over the past month. While the schools will switch to online learning, there is deep concern that many students lack tablets and other necessary materials.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Melissa Eddy</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gaia-pianigiani" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Gaia Pianigiani</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anna-schaverien" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Anna Schaverien</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karen-zraick" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Karen Zraick</a> and </p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="get-vaccinated-right-away-polls-find-growing-hesitation-in-the-us"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#get-vaccinated-right-away-polls-find-growing-hesitation-in-the-us">Get vaccinated right away?

Gavin Newsom said on Monday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Of course we won&#8217;t take anyone&#8217;s word for it,&#8221; he said in a news briefing. He emphasized that the &#8220;second set of eyes&#8221; on potential vaccines is part of California&#8217;s broader efforts to make sure that vaccines get equitably distributed to communities that are most vulnerable.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While Mr. Newsom acknowledged that the vaccine approval process has been politicized, he said, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter who the next president is, we&#8217;re going to maintain our vigilance.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The announcement came <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-vaccine.html" title="">after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York</a> said that his state would also review vaccines approved by the federal government &#8212; although Mr. Cuomo tied the move to doubts raised when President Trump suggested that he would reject tougher F.D.A. guidelines. &#8220;Frankly, I&#8217;m not going to trust the federal government&#8217;s opinion,&#8221; Mr. Cuomo said in late September.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Sunday, Mr. Cuomo, as head of the bipartisan National Governors Association, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/18/world/covid-coronavirus/once-theres-a-vaccine-how-will-it-be-doled-out-governors-have-questions" title="">posed additional questions</a> about how the Trump administration will ensure that states are able to get and distribute vaccines.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Newsom said that his state is working with the federal government on its vaccination plans, but that experts from California&#8217;s prestigious academic and health care institutions are helping to figure out expected logistical challenges. They include where to store vaccines that must be kept cold, how to notify people about when to get their second shots and how to guarantee that rural communities have access to vaccines.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Newsom cautioned against being &#8220;overly exuberant&#8221; about the prospect of widespread vaccination; he said that won&#8217;t happen until next year. &#8220;This vaccine will move at the speed of trust,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">California&#8217;s new case rates have stayed relatively low, even as the state has expanded testing and gradually lifted restrictions on businesses. Still, the governor implored residents <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/california-gatherings-coronavirus.html" title="">not to let their guard down as the holidays approach</a>.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jill-cowan" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="in-a-bright-spot-for-nyc-schools-10676-tests-yield-just-18-positives"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#in-a-bright-spot-for-nyc-schools-10676-tests-yield-just-18-positives">In a bright spot for N.Y.C. schools, 10,676 tests yield just 18 positives.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A public school in Brooklyn this month. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York planned to reimpose restrictions on schools in neighborhoods where coronavirus cases were on the rise.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse &#8212; Getty Images</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For months, as New York City struggled to start part-time, in-person classes, fear grew that its 1,800 public schools would become vectors of coronavirus infection.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But nearly three weeks into the in-person school year, early data from the city&#8217;s first effort at targeted testing has shown the opposite: <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/nyregion/coronavirus-testing-schools-nyc.html" title="">a surprisingly small number of positive test results</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Out of 15,111 staff members and students tested randomly by the school system in the first week of its testing regimen, the city has gotten back results for 10,676. There were only 18 positives: 13 staff members and five students.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And when officials put mobile testing units at schools near Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods that have had new outbreaks, only four positive cases turned up &#8212; out of more than 3,300 tests conducted since the last week of September.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">New York City is facing fears of a second wave of the virus brought on by localized spikes in Brooklyn and Queens, which have required new <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/nyregion/cuomo-shutdown-coronavirus.html" title="">shutdown restrictions</a> that included the closure of more than 120 public schools as a precaution.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that city continued to see a &#8220;leveling off&#8221; in those areas and officials had seen &#8220;particular progress&#8221; in central Queens, the mayor said. But he did not provide data for those areas.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Across the city, the seven-day average positivity rate was at 1.62 percent, the mayor said. When he first announced an uptick in cases about three weeks ago, the positivity rate was 1.38 percent.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Shortly afterward on Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that data in different hot spot areas across the state where he had imposed restrictions by zones would continue to be reviewed, and that the state would &#8220;announce changes to the zones&#8221; on Wednesday. Zone sizes could be made larger or smaller, he said, adding that &#8220;we have total flexibility in these zones.&#8221; </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Statewide, the daily positivity rate was 1.21 percent, he said, while the &#8220;red zones,&#8221; which have the most severe restrictions in place, had a positivity rate of 3.31 percent. Hospitalizations statewide, which have been steadily increasing in recent weeks, are 934.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But for now, at least, New York City&#8217;s sprawling system of public schools, the nation&#8217;s largest, is an unexpected bright spot as the city tries to recover from a pandemic that has killed more than 20,000 people and severely weakened its economy.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In September, New York became the first big urban district to reopen schools for in-person learning.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Roughly half of the city&#8217;s students have opted for hybrid learning, where they are in the building some days, but not others. The approach has enabled the city to keep class sizes small.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dana-rubinstein" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Dana Rubinstein</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/j-david-goodman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">J.

But after it reopened all its schools for in-person instruction in early September, case counts started climbing, and the country is now battling a major surge of infections and hospitalizations. Poland has reported <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html" title="">49,950 new cases in the last seven days, according to a New York Times database</a>, and 175,766 in all, with more than 3,500 Covid-19-related deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With hospital beds filling up, there is particular concern about the damage that the virus could sow in Poland, which has a relatively weak health care system and one of the lowest ratios of doctors and nurses to residents in the European Union.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">To deal with the surge, the government is transforming the national stadium in Warsaw into a field hospital. The health minister, Adam Niedzielski, said on Monday that temporary Covid-19 hospitals would also be set up in other major cities, and that he was in discussions with private hospitals about making more beds available. Mr. Niedzielski warned that if the virus continued to spread at its current pace, the country could soon be facing as many as 20,000 new cases a day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In other developments around the world:</p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/travel/american-travelers-restrictions-coronavirus.html" title="">Restrictions on nonessential travel</a> between the <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">United States, Canada</strong> and <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Mexico</strong> will be extended until Nov. 21, Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, announced on Monday. &#8220;We are working closely with Mexico &amp; Canada to identify safe criteria to ease the restrictions in the future &amp; support our border communities,&#8221; Mr. Wolf <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/DHS_Wolf/status/1318191786783813634" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Twitter.</a> In the past seven days, Canada has reported 16,284 cases, which works out to 44 per 100,000 people; Mexico, 33,724 cases, or 27 per 100,000; and the U.S., 396,305 cases, or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">119 per 100,000</a>.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Officials in <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Melbourne, Australia</strong>, announced some easing of one of the world&#8217;s strictest lockdowns, allowing residents to travel up to 25 kilometers from their homes and up to 10 people from two households to socialize outdoors.

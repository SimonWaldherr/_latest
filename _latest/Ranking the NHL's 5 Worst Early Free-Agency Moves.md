The NHL free-agent market opened Friday. While the flattened salary cap and the absence of the interview period seem to have affected the market, a number of players signed with new clubs.

In the past, the early days of free agency usually resulted in a blizzard of expensive, long-term contracts. The stagnant cap, however, means many teams have limited cap space to invest this year. That's resulted in frugal, sensible signings rather than bidding wars and overpaid free agents.

Nevertheless, there were a handful of questionable moves, such as the Washington Capitals' signing of defenseman Justin Schultz and the Edmonton Oilers bringing back goaltender Mike Smith. While the contracts weren't onerous, the teams gave valuable salary-cap dollars to players whose best years are well behind them.

Here's a look at the five worst early moves in 2020 free agency. Player performances and contract terms factored in to this ranking.

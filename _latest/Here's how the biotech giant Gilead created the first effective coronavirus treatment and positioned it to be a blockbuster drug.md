Remdesivir is an experimental drug that became the first effective coronavirus treatment option, after previously failing as an Ebola therapy.

President Donald Trump received the antiviral as part of his COVID-19 care, as have thousands of hospitalized coronavirus patients.

While supply was limited when US regulators first issued an emergency approval in May, remdesivir's developer Gilead Sciences has ramped up production and expects to meet demand in the US and Europe going forward.

The drug has also become an overnight blockbuster for the California biotech giant, with Wall Street analysts projecting billions in sales in 2020 and 2021.

Here's how remdesivir, also marketed by Gilead as Veklury, became an early, effective tool against the coronavirus pandemic.

A failed Ebola drug has become one of the most effective tools we have to fight the novel coronavirus.

The therapy is an antiviral drug called remdesivir, which was developed by Gilead Sciences, a giant biotechnology company.

Final study results published in October showed the drug helped hospitalized patients with COVID-19 recover faster than those receiving a placebo. On average, the typical recovery time was 10 days for those getting remdesivir compared to 15 days among the placebo group.

President Donald Trump is among the thousands who have received remdesivir. The Food and Drug Administration has given an emergency ok for the drug's use in any hospitalized patient with the coronavirus, but the treatment still isn't officially approved. Remdesivir is given as a five-day or 10-day infusion, and costs at least $2,340 for the five-day treatment course.

While initial supply was constrained, Gilead has since expanded its production and expects to fully meet demand in the US and Europe for the drug. The company projects to produce more than 2 milllion treatment courses by the end of 2020. That will translate into a sizable revenue stream for the biotech giant, with Wall Street analysts projecting the drug will bring in $2.4 billion in sales in 2020.

Remdesivir, also called Veklury, had a head start in proving effective in treating COVID-19 because Gilead has been working on the drug since 2009 and had already shown it's safe for people to take.

Gilead is also working to see how well remdesivir works in combination with other medications, including the anti-inflammatory drugs baricitinib and tocilizumab. In September, a combination of baricitinib and remdesivir proved to reduce hospitalization times for COVID-19 patients.

Some other existing drugs that have been tested against the virus have disappointed in human trials, including an HIV drug called Kaletra, the antimalarial pills chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the arthritis drug Kevzara.

Remdesivir isn't alone in showing some success in COVID-19 patients. A common steroid, dexamethasone, drastically reduced coronavirus deaths in a study.

Treatments specifically made to fight the novel coronavirus, called monoclonal antibodies, have shown some promise as well. The leading antibody drugmakers have applied for emergency use.

How remdesivir became the best prospect against COVID-19

Gilead, which has a market value of just around $80 billion, has been in the infectious disease business for decades. The company makes treatments for the hepatitis C virus and has a wide variety of drugs to fight HIV, including the prevention pill Truvada. The company registered more than $16 billion in revenue last year from its HIV portfolio.

Remdesivir, in fact, was developed as part of an effort to find treatments for hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus, a Gilead spokesperson told Business Insider in April.

Laboratory results published in 2017 showed remdesivir's activity in test tubes against the two other major coronavirus outbreaks of the 21st century, SARS and MERS.

It had also been used in studies during the West African Ebola virus epidemic between 2013 and 2016 and was later given emergency-use authorization to treat Ebola as part of the epidemic in Congo.

The drug was one of four studied for Ebola as part of a randomized trial published in 2019, but two other drugs outperformed remdesivir.

But because it had already been tested in patients, the drug had been proven safe for humans to take when it came to treating people with COVID-19.

When the first case of COVID-19 in the US showed up in Washington state in January, the medical professionals caring for the patient decided to administer remdesivir on the man's seventh day in the hospital, according to a case report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient ultimately recovered.

In February, an official with the World Health Organization said remdesivir was "one drug right now that we think may have efficacy" in treating COVID-19. Gilead's stock hit a 16-month high that day. By the end of February, Gilead had launched trials of the drug across Asian countries where the virus was spreading and in the US.

On June 1, Gilead said that remdesivir helped hospitalized patients with more moderate forms of COVID-19 recover more quickly when receiving the treatment intravenously for 5 days. The results were mixed, however, in moderately ill patients who got the treatment for 10 days. In that case, results weren't statistically significant, the company said.

In August, Gilead started testing an inhaled version of the drug, with the hopes of making it available to use earlier, potentially before people with COVID-19 are hospitalized.

While supplies of remdesivir were limited in the early months of the pandemic, Gilead has massively ramped up its production. The company now expects to produce more than 2 million treatment courses by the end of 2020, enough to meet the demand of the US and Europe, the biotech said.

Gilead has also licensed out rights to make the drug to a variety of international manufacturers to supply remdesivir to low- and middle-income countries.

Why remdesivir is 'not the panacea' for the coronavirus

Even with data showing remdesivir can help some hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is unlikely to be a cure-all for the virus, experts said.

Vaccines are our best tools to counteract infectious diseases, and late-stage trials are underway to see if they're effective in preventing the disease.

A step down from vaccines is preventive treatments â€” drugs given to those at high risk of becoming infected, such as the families of those who are sick and healthcare workers. A number of studies are underway to find treatments that do just that. Remdesivir isn't tested to prevent infections.

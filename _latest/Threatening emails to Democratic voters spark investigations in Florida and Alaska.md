Democrats in Alachua County, in north-central Florida, reported receiving the messages. So, too, did voters in southeast and southwest Alaska, according to <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/10/20/alaskans-report-emails-warning-to-vote-for-trump-or-else/">Alaska Public Media</a>, prompting voting rights organizations to <a href="https://twitter.com/KristenClarkeJD/status/1318654206744592387?s=20">put out a call</a> on social media to voters in both states, asking them to report any threatening correspondence.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Federal authorities, elections officials and experts in disinformation have issued dire warnings not just about voter intimidation but also about deceptive online campaigns playing up fears of intimidation tactics.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Tarrio said he had already spoken to an FBI agent about the episode. Amanda Videll, a spokeswoman for the bureau in Jacksonville, Fla., declined to comment.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">A spokesman for the Alachua County Sheriff&#8217;s Office said local authorities were coordinating with elections officials and had also sought the assistance of the FBI.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;We believe them to be fraudulent,&#8221; the spokesman, Art Forgey, said of the emails.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The domain, <a href="http://officialproudboys.com/" target="_blank">officialproudboys.com</a>, was left unsecured because of unpaid hosting fees, meaning anyone on the Internet could have taken control of it and used the site to send out the menacing messages, said Trevor Davis, CEO of Counteraction, a Washington-based digital intelligence firm.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;It appears they allowed their domain to lapse since Oct. 8, which likely made them vulnerable to this kind of hijacking,&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;Bad actors are constantly scanning the Internet for opportunities. Given the public profile of the Proud Boys and the likelihood that whoever&#8217;s sending these emails has access to a voter file, this appears to be opportunism.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The Proud Boys rose to national prominence last month during the first presidential debate between Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, when the president passed up an invitation by moderator Chris Wallace, of Fox News, to denounce white supremacists. When Biden suggested that Trump denounce the Proud Boys, he said, &#8220;stand back and stand by&#8221; &#8212; a comment that was widely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/30/trump-debate-rightwing-celebration/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21">celebrated on social media</a> by the group as a call to action.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Memes circulated online with the words integrated into the Proud Boys logo. One doctored image showed Trump wearing one of the Proud Boys&#8217; signature polo shirts. Another online poster used the moment to advertise t-shirts and hoodies bearing the group&#8217;s logo and the words, &#8220;PROUD BOYS STANDING BY.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The group&#8217;s leaders say they do not support white supremacy, but they had a contingent at 2017&#8217;s notorious Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. The Proud Boys also have been frequent participants in the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-expresses-support-for-angry-anti-shutdown-protesters-as-more-states-lift-coronavirus-lockdowns/2020/05/01/25570dbe-8b9f-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_48&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_24"> reopen protests demonstrating against</a> coronavirus lockdowns and, more recently, the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/portland-proud-boys-rally/2020/09/26/9e4ca5a0-0046-11eb-830c-a160b331ca62_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_48&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_24"> protests in Portland</a>, Ore. Facebook has banned the group as a hate group, and the Southern Poverty Law Center classifies them as a hate group and says its leaders &#8220;regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Online analysts traced the pathway of at least one of the emails through a server in Saudi Arabia. The Internet Protocol address associated with metadata in the email had previously been reported, pointing to its likely use in scam or phishing operations, said Cindy Otis, a former CIA analyst and vice president of analysis for Alethea Group, an organization combating online threats and misinformation. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88a43b/proud-boys-emails-threatening-florida-voters-appear-to-use-spoofed-email-address">Vice</a>, citing a similar email purportedly from the Proud Boys and threatening Florida voters, found another possible path through a server in Estonia.</p></div>

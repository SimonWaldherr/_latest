   <p>"The temperatures drop, we are all indoors more often, we have the other infections that come this time of year."</p> <p>However, he said there is "light at the end of the tunnel" as he believes a Covid-19 vaccine and effective treatment will be ready in early 2021.</p> <p>Of today's increase in hospital deaths, England reported 61 fatalities, Northern Ireland had five, Wales recorded three and Scotland experienced none.</p> <p>It is the largest increase on a Sunday since 77 deaths were announced on June 7.</p>

<p>Dr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine in London, said that although treatment is improving, social distancing is also having an impact on transmission and viral load.</p> <p>She said: "It is still a very deadly virus, although the majority of people who still become infected will have a very, very minor illness or may not even know that they are ill at all.</p> <p>"For those people that require hospital admission, for those that come to intensive care it's still a very severe disease."</p> <p>She added: "If you end up in critical care with Covid pneumonia you are almost twice as likely to die than somebody who's admitted with a pneumonia not due to Covid - so it is still something to be worried about."</p></div>

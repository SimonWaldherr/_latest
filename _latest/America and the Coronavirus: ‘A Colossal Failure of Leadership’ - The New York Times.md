<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But the C.D.C. devised a faulty test, and turf wars in the federal government prevented the use of other tests. South Korea, Germany and other countries quickly developed tests that did work, and these were distributed around the world. Sierra Leone in West Africa had effective tests before the United States did.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Trump supporters note, correctly, that within the United States, the states with the highest mortality rates have been Democrat-led: New Jersey has had the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most deaths per capita</a>, followed by New York. It&#8217;s true that local politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, made disastrous decisions, as when Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/BilldeBlasio/status/1234648718714036229" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged</a> people in March to &#8220;get out on the town despite coronavirus.&#8221; But local officials erred in part because of the failure of testing: Without tests, they didn&#8217;t know what they faced.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">It&#8217;s unfair to blame the testing catastrophe entirely on Trump, for the failures unfolded several paygrades below him. Partly that&#8217;s because Trump appointees, like Robert Redfield, director of the C.D.C., simply aren&#8217;t the A team.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In any case, presidents set priorities for lower officials. If Trump had pushed aides as hard to get accurate tests as he pushed to repel refugees and migrants, then America almost certainly would have had an effective test by the beginning of February and tens of thousands of lives would have been saved.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Still, testing isn&#8217;t essential if a country gets backup steps right. Japan is a densely populated country that did not test much and yet has only <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;country=USA~ITA~Europe~EuropeanUnion~JPN&amp;region=World&amp;deathsMetric=true&amp;interval=total&amp;perCapita=true&amp;smoothing=0&amp;pickerMetric=total_deaths&amp;pickerSort=desc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2 percent</a> as many deaths per capita as the United States. One reason is that Japanese have long embraced face masks, which Dr. Redfield has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200916/cdc-chief-walks-back-masks-v-vaccine-comments" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> can be at least as effective as a vaccine in fighting the pandemic. A country doesn&#8217;t have to do everything, if it does some things right.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Yet in retrospect, Trump did almost everything wrong. He discouraged mask wearing. The administration never rolled out contact tracing, missed opportunities to isolate the infected and exposed, didn&#8217;t adequately protect nursing homes, issued advice that confused the issues more than clarified them, and handed responsibilities to states and localities that were unprepared to act. Trump did do a good job of accelerating <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-operation-warp-speed.html" title="">a vaccine</a>, but that won&#8217;t help significantly until next year.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Trump&#8217;s missteps arose in part because he channeled an anti-intellectual current that runs deep in the United States, as he sidelined scientific experts and responded to the virus with a sunny optimism apparently meant to bolster the financial markets.</p></div>

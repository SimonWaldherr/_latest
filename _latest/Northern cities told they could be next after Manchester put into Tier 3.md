  Northern cities told they could be next after Manchester put into Tier 3

  Mr Johnson warned that the country was on a "narrow path" and said he could not "rule out" further measures.He stressed that he did not want to reimpose a national lockdown and believed regional measures were best "given the way the virus is dispersed".A deal with Manchester collapsed when the region's Mayor, Andy Burnham, rejected an offer of £60 million to help local businesses, insisting £65 million was the least he would accept.Meanwhile, the leader of Hartlepool Council, one of the areas under discussion for top tier measures, said ministers would be told to "sod off" if they suggested putting the town into Tier 3.Although the vote will be symbolic, it is designed to put pressure on Northern Tories to rebel against the Government and undermine its three-tier policy.

<div><p>Mr Johnson warned that the country was on a "narrow path" and said he could not "rule out" further measures. He stressed that he did not want to reimpose a national lockdown and believed regional measures were best "given the way the virus is dispersed".&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/boris-johnson-manchester-tier-3-lockdown-brexit-news-latest/">A deal with Manchester collapsed</a> when the region's Mayor, Andy Burnham, rejected an offer of &#163;60 million to help local businesses, insisting &#163;65 million was the least he would accept.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said it was "unfortunate" that he was having to act unilaterally, but added: "Given the public health situation... not to act would put Manchester's NHS, and the lives of many of Manchester's residents, at risk."</p>
<p>Mr Burnham accused the Prime Minister of "playing poker with people's lives" but had to deny that he had wanted to walk away in order to score a propaganda coup.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson also faced a fierce backlash from some of his own MPs <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/19/blue-blue-tory-row-old-against-newthan-south-versus-north/">in former "Red Wall" seats</a>, one of whom said the Government was guilty of an "overwhelming" failure of negotiation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the leader of Hartlepool Council, one of the areas under discussion for top tier measures, said ministers <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/boris-johnson-manchester-tier-3-lockdown-brexit-news-latest/">would be told to "sod off"</a> if they suggested putting the town into Tier 3.</p>
<p>Labour will on Wednesday try to drive a wedge between the Government and its Northern MPs by forcing a vote on whether Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, should extend the furlough scheme to areas in Tier 3, paying 80 per cent of the wages of those who cannot work rather than <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/09/24/job-support-scheme-key-elements-rishi-sunaks-plan-will-work/">the current two-thirds</a>.</p>
<p>Although the vote will be symbolic, it is designed to put pressure on Northern Tories to rebel against the Government and undermine its three-tier policy.</p>
<p>Up to 12 million people could be living under tier three measures &#8211; meaning the closure of pubs and some other businesses and a ban on household mixing &#8211; after Manchester <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/lockdown-wales-manchester-york-ireland-liverpool-lancashire-local-rules-covid/">joined Merseyside and Lancashire</a> in the harshest category of restrictions.</p>

Chrissy Teigen revealed she’s “finally giggled” as she made a quiet return to social media two weeks after the tragic death of her baby son.

The model, 34, commented on a funny upload from the Betches Instagram account, which pulls in hilarious content from across social media.

The little bit of light relief was originally posted by Kara Morehart and read: “Just booked an eyebrow waxing appointment and I’m excited I’ll be wearing a mask so I don’t have to hear “mustache too?”

The Betches team then added: “It’s the little things…”

It tickled Chrissy, who commented: “Finally, a giggle. Thank you.”

Fans of Chrissy’s then sent her their love and condolences, while the Betches account wrote: “it is an honor and a privilege.”

The Sports Illustrated star shared the tragic news of her pregnancy loss in a heartbreaking Instagram post, saying she had suffered “excessive bleeding” and that the pair were in “deep pain.”

Accompanied by a series of heart-rending black and white photos of her grieving in hospital, Chrissy wrote: “We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before.

“We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn’t enough.”

Chrissy shared that she and husband John Legend, who have two children, Luna, four, and Miles, two, had already named the son that they lost.

She continued: “We never decide on our babies’ names until the last possible moment after they’re born, just before we leave the hospital.

“But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack. So he will always be Jack to us.

“Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever.”

Chrissy then addressed Jack, writing: “To our Jack – I’m so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn’t give you the home you needed to survive.

“We will always love you.”

The emotional post continued with Chrissy – who revealed in August that she and John were expecting – thanking her followers for their support after she was hospitalized on Sunday.

Chrissy wrote: “Thank you to everyone who has been sending us positive energy, thoughts and prayers.

“We feel all of your love and truly appreciate you.”

The post concluded with Chrissy acknowledging what she is thankful for.

She wrote: “We are so grateful for the life we have, for our wonderful babies Luna and Miles, for all the amazing things we’ve been able to experience.

“But everyday can’t be full of sunshine.

“On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it.”

Chrissy later tweeted: “Driving home from the hospital with no baby. How can this be real.”

A number of stars commented on Chrissy’s Instagram post to react to the sad news.

Kim Kardashian wrote: “We’re always here for you and love you guys so much.”

Channing Tatum commented: “Sending so much love to you right now,” while Kyle Richards added: “Chrissy & John, I am so sorry to hear this news. Sending you all love. Will say a prayer for Jack tonight. Your guardian angel.”

Gabrielle Union added: “We love you guys so much and we will be here for whatever yall need. Always.”

Chrissy had been keeping her fans up to date throughout her pregnancy and previously told her Instagram followers: “I was always, always bleeding.

“I’m about halfway through pregnancy and the blood has been going on for a little less than a month.

“More than a period, girls, and definitely not spotting.”

On September 24, Chrissy announced that her latest cook book would be postponed indefinitely due to her “high-risk” pregnancy.

She added that her third pregnancy was unexpected and she “didn’t think” she was able to get pregnant naturally, as her two other children were conceived through IVF treatments.

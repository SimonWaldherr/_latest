Goldman Sachs has begun offering its US-based bankers free coronavirus tests and antibody tests in a bid to encourage staff back into the office.

In a memo sent on Friday the bank told employees that it had "engaged vendor partners to offer off-site Covid-19 tests to eligible people in the US at no cost". These included tests to diagnose active infection as well as antibody ones that could make some staff more comfortable about commuting.

The programme, which is only free to those who plan to go into the office, is also being considered for employees in other offices including London.

Ashok Varadhan, Goldman's trading co-head, said earlier this year that the bank was considering mass testing as a way to get City workers back to the office.

Goldman's decision to test workers in America comes just a month after it sought to bring its 38,000 staff worldwide back to the office part time on a rota system, although its chief executive David Solomon noted that not all countries were at the same stage in controlling the virus.

It is not alone in using testing as a way to get people back to work. Sources said that Spanish lender Santander mass-tested staff in its Madrid hub after many people returned to the office from long summer holidays in September, while JP Morgan and Credit Suisse also have different testing programmes.

However, many have put their back to work plans on hold as coronavirus cases rise again. In the last few weeks some of Britain's biggest banks, law firms and accountants have panned plans to bring thousands of workers back to the office following new advice from ministers, triggering fears of bankruptcies for the businesses that depend on City trade.

Many also believe that coronavirus has ushered in a new age of remote working, with office use still far below normal across Britain and many major City institutions already making permanent changes to the way their staff work.

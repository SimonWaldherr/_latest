Live Updated Oct. 14, 2020, 5:43 a.m. ET Oct. 14, 2020, 5:43 a.m. ET Covid-19 Live Updates: Reinfections Are Real but Very, Very Rare A case in Nevada has prompted concerns that people who have recovered from the coronavirus may still be vulnerable. That’s unlikely, experts say. RIGHT NOW England’s three-tier system gets off to a chaotic start in Liverpool.

Yes, you can be reinfected with the coronavirus. But it’s extremely unlikely. There have been fewer than five confirmed cases of coronavirus reinfections. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times More than 38 million people worldwide have been infected with the coronavirus, and as of Monday, fewer than five of those cases have been confirmed by scientists to be reinfections. Nevertheless, fears of repeat bouts of illness, impotent vaccines and unrelenting lockdowns were raised anew when a case study about a 25-year-old man in Nevada was published on Monday. The man, who was not named, became sicker the second time that he was infected with the virus, a pattern the immune system is supposed to prevent. And rare as these cases may be, they do indicate that reinfection is possible, said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, who wrote a commentary accompanying the Nevada case study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The New York Times asked more experts what is known about reinfections with the coronavirus. It’s impossible to know how widespread the phenomenon is, they told us. To confirm a case, scientists must look for significant differences in the genes of the two coronaviruses causing both illnesses. In the U.S., many people were not tested unless they were sick enough to be hospitalized. Even then, their samples were usually not preserved for genetic analysis, making it impossible to confirm suspected reinfections. Plus, a resurgence of symptoms doesn’t prove reinfection. More likely, these are people experiencing symptoms connected to the original infection. But people with a second bout may pass the virus to others. An infection in a patient in Hong Kong was discovered only because of routine screening at the airport, and the man was isolated in a hospital even though he had no symptoms. But his viral load was high enough that he could have passed the virus to others. —

Pret A Manger will try anything to survive. A Pret A Manger in London. The chain’s new coffee subscription plan is also a way to gather data on the preferences of its customers. Credit... Tom Jamieson for The New York Times For some companies, the only response to the pandemic has been to hunker down and try to avoid running out of cash before their customers can return. Pret, the 37-year-old British sandwich and coffee chain that’s ubiquitous in central London, is now clearly willing to try anything: Pret wants to sell its food in supermarkets, and has already begun selling coffee beans on Amazon.

It has signed up to all the major food delivery platforms to bring its sandwiches, soups and salads to its work-from-home customers.

It opened a so-called dark kitchen in North London to prepare its food strictly for delivery, modeled on the success of Sweetgreen and Shake Shack, and hopes to open another dark kitchen in either New York or New Jersey soon.

It is devising a special menu of hot evening meals for delivery, such as a Chipotle Chicken Burrito Bowl​.

And then there is the coffee subscription, an effort to drive people back to the stores: Five drinks a day made by a barista (coffees, teas and smoothies) for 20 pounds ($26) a month. On the face of it, it could be an extraordinarily good deal. With two lattes a week, a subscriber will break even. And the first month is free. (Small print: You can’t order five drinks at once — there must be 30 minutes between each drink order.) —

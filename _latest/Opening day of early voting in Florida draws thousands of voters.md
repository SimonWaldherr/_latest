  Opening day of early voting in Florida draws thousands of voters

  “So the first chance I got, I was going to take it.”Woodard said President Trump’s constant attacks on mail voting, including unsubstantiated claims that it would result in widespread fraud, are a blatant attempt at voter suppression.ADBut it is too early to say whether the first round of in-person voting in Florida would favor Democrats or Republicans.In other states where such data is available, enthusiasm is far higher among registered Democrats among both mail and in-person voting.In Pinellas County, home of Clearwater and St. Petersburg, more voters had cast ballots by midday than voted early overall in 2016, according to county data.In mail ballots, the Democratic advantage in Pinellas, which narrowly supported Trump in 2016, was even starker: 77,847 to 52,430.

That represents more than a fifth of total turnout in 2016.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In downtown Sarasota, a major Republican stronghold in Florida since the 1970s, people began lining up to cast their ballots 90 minutes before Supervisor of Elections Ron Turner opened his doors at 8:30 a.m. The line stretched out of the building, constructed as a hotel in 1925 by circus magnate John Ringling&#8217;s brother, Charles, and into a tree-shaded courtyard where a steady breeze cooled the crowd. A partisan breakdown of turnout so far was not immediately available.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In Pinellas County, home of Clearwater and St. Petersburg, more voters had cast ballots by midday than voted early overall in 2016, according to county data. By midday, Democrats had outvoted Republicans 2,606 to 2,348. In mail ballots, the Democratic advantage in Pinellas, which narrowly supported Trump in 2016, was even starker: 77,847 to 52,430.</p><p></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In Lee County, home of Fort Myers, Republicans were outvoting Democrats both by mail and in person.

I&#8217;m super scared if Biden wins what&#8217;s going to happen to my career, my parents, my family and my friends with health care.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The coronavirus is doing more in Florida than increasing mail balloting; it also shuttered an elections office in Okaloosa County, in the state&#8217;s Panhandle, after Elections Supervisor Paul Lux and several other employees tested positive for the virus, <a href="https://www.thedestinlog.com/story/news/2020/10/19/okaloosa-county-supervisor-elections-tests-positive-coronavirus/3709662001/">according to the Destin Log</a>.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In-person voting also kicked off in Colorado Monday, but voting centers were largely quiet in a state where the majority of voters have cast ballots by mail or drop box for many years.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Yet mail ballot returns show historic enthusiasm in Colorado, too, with Secretary of State Jena Griswold reporting that 24 times more voters have returned their ballots than by this time in 2016. She also said a historic number of people applied to be election judges.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;I was really motivated to get here and get my ballot in,&#8221; said Robbie Martinez, 46, a journeyman electrician, after dropping his ballot into a drop box in downtown Denver. &#8220;I have never liked Trump. I couldn&#8217;t even believe he became president. It&#8217;s been a circus.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md bold">

Biden Jr., who for weeks has declined to clarify his position on expanding the Supreme Court, said in a new interview that if elected, he would establish a bipartisan commission of scholars to study possible court overhaul more broadly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I will ask them to, over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it&#8217;s getting out of whack,&#8221; he told CBS News&#8217;s Norah O&#8217;Donnell, according to an interview excerpt that is expected to be broadcast Sunday on CBS&#8217;s &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The way in which it&#8217;s being handled, and it&#8217;s not about court packing, there&#8217;s a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I&#8217;ve looked to see what recommendations that commission might make.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has previously opposed expanding the Supreme Court, but amid the current battle over Judge Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s nomination by President Trump just before the election, he has declined to take a clear position on the issue. However, he promised last week that he would make his position known to voters before Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The topic is likely to surface at tonight&#8217;s presidential debate.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want,&#8221; Mr. Biden said. &#8220;Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He called the issue a &#8220;live ball&#8221; and said there were &#8220;a number of alternatives&#8221; that &#8220;go well beyond packing.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-glueck" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="when-a-pandemic-makes-the-rules-campaigns-are-bent-into-entirely-new-shapes-one-will-succeed"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#when-a-pandemic-makes-the-rules-campaigns-are-bent-into-entirely-new-shapes-one-will-succeed">When a pandemic makes the rules, campaigns are bent into new shapes.

Biden Jr. is entering its final chapter. And once again voters are being reminded just how completely the pandemic has upended this race for the White House.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a normal election year, both candidates would leave Nashville for a nonstop swing through battleground states, packing their days with big rallies, appeals to both supporters and thecurious who are trying to decide who to support. Mr. Trump has pledged to keep on making live appearances in front of big crowds, in defiance of the counsel of medical experts. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Mr. Biden will defer to the advice of health professionals, largely limiting his campaigning to smaller and more controlled events that respect the rules of social distancing and that have been his staple during this odd campaign.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Will that matter?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">This is the time of election season when candidates make their closing arguments and implore supporters to turn out. Mr. Trump, in pushing ahead with his rallies, is well aware of how effective they can be at generating excitement among supporters, as he saw at his huge rallies in 2016. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">George W. Bush demonstrated the power of showing up in 2004 when he arrived on Election Day for a rally in Ohio having made the correct calculation that the excitement and attention generated by a last-minute visit might pull him over the finish line. He defeated his Democratic rival, John F. Kerry, with just under 51 percent of the vote in Ohio.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But that does not necessarily mean that Mr. Biden is at a disadvantage in these final days. From the beginning of the coronavirus, he ran a constrained campaign in deference to the virus, with significantly less travel, fewer public events and even fewer news conferences. He drew some criticism, but it appears to be working to his benefit, if the polls are to be believed. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And one reason he has so much <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/trump-money-biden.html" title="">more money on hand than Mr. Trump does in these final weeks</a>, is that he had far fewer expenses. Those planes, motorcades, hotel rooms and catered meals add up.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Should Mr. Biden win, future presidential candidates might compare the Trump and Biden campaigns in the age of Covid as a case study in how to campaign in the digital age. All those trappings of the modern-day campaign &#8212; the blur of rallies, the fully catered chartered airplanes, the nights at Motel 7 (OK, at the Westin) &#8212; might not be needed to win the White House.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-nagourney" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="republicans-are-set-to-advance-barretts-nomination-this-morning-as-democrats-boycott"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#republicans-are-set-to-advance-barretts-nomination-this-morning-as-democrats-boycott">Republicans are set to advance Barrett&#8217;s nomination this morning as Democrats boycott.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump&#8217;s nominee for the&#160; Supreme Court, is expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but Democrats might not be there." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/21election-briefing-barrett/merlin_178837371_40f8ff48-bf1a-4531-93cf-1b7e9a44b8f3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump&#8217;s nominee for the&#160; Supreme Court, is expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but Democrats might not be there.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Republicans who control the Senate Judiciary Committee were prepared on Thursday to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/politics/barrett-nomination-republicans.html" title="">advance the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court</a>, planning to skirt the panel&#8217;s rules and vote to recommend her confirmation as Democrats boycott the session.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Though the panel was not scheduled to convene until 9 a.m., all 12 Republicans had already signaled that Judge Barrett had their enthusiastic backing. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Their action would set up a vote by the full Senate on Monday to confirm Judge Barrett, delivering President Trump and Republicans a coveted achievement just eight days before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Democrats who hold 10 of the 22 seats on the committee are livid over the extraordinarily speedy process and plan to spurn the committee vote altogether. By doing so, they&#8217;re effectively daring Republicans to break their own rules to muscle the nomination through. Without the votes to block the judge in either the committee or the full Senate, though, their action is purely symbolic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats have sharply opposed Judge Barrett, a conservative <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/amy-coney-barrett-conservatives.html" title="">in the mold of former Justice Antonin Scalia</a>, on policy grounds. But their goal on Thursday was to tarnish the legitimacy of her confirmation, arguing that Republicans had no right to fill the seat vacated just over a month ago by the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html" title="">death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, when millions of Americans were already voting.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats were particularly angry that Republicans had reversed themselves since 2016, when they refused to consider President Barack Obama&#8217;s Supreme Court nominee nine months before the election that year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Republicans have moved at breakneck speed to jam through this nominee, ignoring her troubling record and unprecedented evasions, and breaking longstanding committee rules to set tomorrow&#8217;s vote,&#8221; Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement on Wednesday. &#8220;We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just 12 days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats planned to hold a news conference on the steps of the Capitol galvanizing opposition to the process. Left in their places in the hearing room will be large posters of Americans whose health care coverage they argue could evaporate if Judge Barrett were to side with a conservative majority on the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act when it hears a Republican <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/supreme-court-obamacare-appeal.html" title="">challenge to the law</a> next month.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="the-local-authorities-in-florida-investigate-a-report-of-possible-armed-voter-intimidation"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#the-local-authorities-in-florida-investigate-a-report-of-possible-armed-voter-intimidation">The local authorities in Florida investigate a report of possible armed voter intimidation.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A early voter receiving an &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker at the St. Petersburg College polling site in Pinellas County, Fla., on Wednesday" class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/us/22elections-briefing-florida-voter-intimidation/merlin_178863648_f508567d-4c3d-4592-8e90-f9549f4dc87e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A early voter receiving an &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker at the St. Petersburg College polling site in Pinellas County, Fla., on Wednesday</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Octavio Jones/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Pinellas County Sheriff&#8217;s office is investigating possible voter intimidation after two people dressed as security guards &#8212; one possibly armed &#8212; set up a tent outside a polling station open for early voting in St. Petersburg, Fla., on Wednesday, according to local officials.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;These persons claimed or said that they were hired by the Trump campaign,&#8221; Julie Marcus, the Pinellas County supervisor of elections, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-pinellas/sheriffs-office-investigates-report-of-possible-voter-intimidation-at-st-pete-voting-location-pinellas-soe-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the local ABC affiliate WFTS</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to speculate to that.

Ms. Marcus said law enforcement would be there to ensure the integrity of the voting process.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Trump campaign issued a statement saying it did not hire the men.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The campaign did not hire these individuals nor did the campaign direct them to go to the voting location,&#8221; the Trump campaign&#8217;s deputy national press secretary said in a statement to the station.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I and the sheriff take voter intimidation very seriously,&#8221; Ms. Marcus said. &#8220;This is unacceptable. I have been here for 17 years and I have never seen this happen before.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump has made challenging the legitimacy of the vote a cornerstone of his re-election campaign, spreading <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/trump-vote-by-mail.html" title="">falsehoods about voting by mail</a> and declaring the election &#8220;rigged&#8221; even before any votes had been cast.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He used the first nationally televised debate with former Vice President Joseph R.

Biden Jr. at the race&#8217;s most crucial juncture.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">To close the budget gap, Mr. Trump has slashed millions of dollars in previously reserved television ads and detoured from the battleground states that will decide the election for a stop in California last weekend to refill his campaign coffers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He has also tried to jump-start his online fund-raising with increasingly aggressive tactics, sending out as many as 14 email solicitations in a day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Mr. Biden still entered October with nearly triple the campaign money Mr. Trump has &#8212; $177 million to $63.1 million &#8212; and is leveraging that edge to expand the battleground map just as Mr. Trump is forced to retrench.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Despite raising more than $1.5 billion in tandem with the Republican Party since 2019, Mr. Trump is now in the same financial straits as he was four years ago, when Hillary Clinton had roughly double the money he did.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump has been quick to point out that Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s financial advantage did not win her the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the financial pinch has engulfed his advisers and party officials in an internal blame game after years of bragging about their fund-raising prowess, according to current and former campaign and administration officials.

Wray, the F.B.I. director, in an evening announcement from the bureau&#8217;s headquarters. Intelligence agencies had collected information that Iran planned to take more steps to influence the vote in coming days, prompting the unusual timing of the briefing as an effort to deter further action.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There was no indication that any election result tallies were changed or that information about who is registered to vote was altered, either of which could affect the outcome of voting that has already begun across the country. Nor do the officials claim that either nation had hacked into voter registration systems, leaving open the possibility that it was available to anyone who knew where to look.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The voter data obtained by Iran and Russia was mostly public, according to one intelligence official, and Iran was exploiting it as a political campaign might. Voters&#8217; names and party registrations are publicly available. That information may have been merged with other identifying material, like email addresses, obtained from other databases, according to intelligence officials, including some sold by criminal hacking networks on the &#8220;dark web.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,&#8221; Mr. Ratcliffe said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The administration&#8217;s announcement that a foreign adversary, Iran, had tried to influence the election by sending intimidating emails was both a stark warning and a reminder of how other powers can exploit the vulnerabilities exposed by the Russian interference in 2016. But it may also play into Mr. Trump&#8217;s hands. For weeks he has argued, without evidence, that the Nov. 3 vote will be &#8220;rigged,&#8221; that mail-in ballots will lead to widespread fraud and that the only way he can be defeated is if his opponents cheat.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Now, on the eve of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/trump-biden-presidential-debate.html" title="">the second debate</a>, he has evidence of foreign influence campaigns designed to hurt his re-election chances, even if they do not affect the voting infrastructure.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Some of the fake emails, sent to Democratic voters, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/florida-alaska-trump-emails.html" title="">purported to be</a> from pro-Trump far-right groups, including the Proud Boys. Iranian hackers tried to cover their tracks, intelligence and security officials said, first routing the emails first through a compromised Saudi insurance company network. Later they sent more than 1,500 emails using the website of an Estonian textbook company, according to an analysis by researchers at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity firm.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Until now, some officials had insisted that Russia remains the primary threat to the election. But the new information, both Republican and Democratic officials said, demonstrates that Iran is building upon Russian techniques and trying to make clear that it, too, is capable of being a force in the election.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julian-barnes" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Julian Barnes</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-e-sanger" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="many-white-suburban-georgia-voters-hold-firm-with-trump"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#many-white-suburban-georgia-voters-hold-firm-with-trump">Many white suburban Georgia voters hold firm with Trump.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Supporters of President Donald Trump at a restaurant in Cummings, Ga., in September." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/politics/21elections-brief-atlanta/merlin_176673081_8ba37f12-f4d9-4169-b7c0-3fc51c3d2abc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Supporters of President Donald Trump at a restaurant in Cummings, Ga., in September.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">National polling has consistently shown that white college-educated voters are supporting Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president. But in Georgia, even as major demographic and population shifts<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>have pulled the state leftward in recent years, a majority of such voters <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_ga_072920.pdf/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remain firmly in Mr. Trump&#8217;s camp</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/ga-ia-tx-crosstabs/ca61e64eaef883ac/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Recent polling</a> shows that these voters have helped Trump maintain his razor-thin lead over Mr. Biden for Georgia&#8217;s suburban vote. Their continued support is critical to the president&#8217;s chances in the state, whose 16 electoral votes are essential for his path to re-election and where polling shows the two candidates neck-and-neck overall.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Georgia may be in the Deep South, but a steady, decades-long influx of young, educated and nonwhite voters, coupled with a shrinking population of white voters without degrees &#8212; whose support helped fuel Mr. Trump&#8217;s victory in 2016 &#8212; have put the state increasingly in play for Democrats. From historic turnout rates among infrequent and first-time voters in support of Stacey Abrams in the 2018 gubernatorial race, to Lucy McBath&#8217;s triumph over Karen Handel in Newt Gingrich&#8217;s former congressional district that same year, down-ballot Democrats have proven the party&#8217;s viability in the Trump era.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For the president, that has made maintaining the loyalty of white, Republican-leaning degree holders all the more important. In a New York Times/Siena College survey on Tuesday, Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden were tied at 45 percent among likely voters in Georgia, but Mr. Trump led Mr. Biden <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/upshot/poll-georgia-biden-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">among college-educated white voters</a> by 12 percentage points (though that is a significant contraction from 2016, when Mr. Trump won the same group by 20 percentage points).</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">According to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/atlanta-trump-voters-women.html" title="">more than a dozen such voters in and around Atlanta</a>, what&#8217;s currently keeping them from jumping ship is not so much a deep affinity for Mr. Trump, but a fear of &#8220;lawlessness&#8221; taking root should Democrats take the White House. Trump has spent much of the past few months stoking those fears, his campaign sending texts with such warnings as &#8220;ANTIFA THUGS WILL RUIN THE SUBURBS!&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Polling suggests that in many battleground states where protests turned violent this summer, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/us/politics/biden-trump-poll-wisconsin-minnesota.html" title="">that message hasn&#8217;t broken through</a>. But in Georgia, many voters said Mr. Trump&#8217;s &#8220;law-and-order&#8221; appeals had struck a nerve, and almost all cited a fear that the call among some progressives to &#8220;defund the police&#8221; would materialize during a Biden presidency.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The riots, the push to defund the police &#8212; that&#8217;s not the direction our country needs to go,&#8221; said Natalie Pontius, a 48-year-old interior decorator and University of Georgia alumna. &#8220;I feel like the Democratic Party is continually trying to come up with ways to divide us.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/elaina-plott" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="obama-mocks-trumps-chinese-bank-account-they-wouldve-called-me-beijing-barry"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#obama-mocks-trumps-chinese-bank-account-they-wouldve-called-me-beijing-barry">Obama mocks Trump&#8217;s Chinese bank account: &#8216;They would&#8217;ve called me Beijing Barry.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Former President Barack Obama spoke at a drive-in rally in Philadelphia on Wednesday" class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/21election-briefing-obama2/merlin_178864065_1cc8dd88-a574-441b-9f41-1c1ff46d02dd-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Former President Barack Obama spoke at a drive-in rally in Philadelphia on Wednesday</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Former President <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/obama-trump.html" title="">Barack Obama made a fiery first in-person campaign appearance</a> on behalf of Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Philadelphia on Wednesday, ridiculing President Trump for complaining about campaigning in Pennsylvania, contracting the coronavirus and hiding business dealings with China.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We know that he continues to do business with China because he has a secret Chinese bank account. How is that possible?&#8221; Mr. Obama asked a crowd of supporters invited to hear him speak in the parking lot of South Philadelphia Sports Complex.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He was referring to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/trump-taxes-china.html?smid=tw-share" title="">New York Times report</a> that revealed previously unknown financial holdings in China &#8212; at a time when the president is criticizing Mr. Biden for ties to that country.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Can you imagine if I had a secret Chinese bank account?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Can you imagine if I had secret Chinese bank account when I was running for re-election?&#8221; His voice straining, he added, &#8220;They would&#8217;ve called me Beijing Barry.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is &#8220;not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, adding that he had probably paid more in taxes working a high school job at an ice-cream parlor than Mr. Trump paid during each of his first two years as president &#8212; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/trump-750-taxes.html" title="">$750</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama&#8217;s long-anticipated speech, the first of several he intends to deliver on behalf of the Biden-Harris ticket over the next two weeks, marked a reversal of his initial reluctance to engage Mr. Trump directly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And even though his remarks, interrupted from time to time by the honking of horns at the drive-in rally, had moments of his signature soaring rhetoric, he seemed to divert somewhat from the kindler-gentler 2016 mantra inspired by his wife, &#8220;When they go low, we go high.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;By the way, his TV ratings are down,&#8221; the former president said. &#8220;So you know that upsets him. But the thing is, this is not a reality show. This is reality. And the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama, who has helped raise millions for his former vice president online but has not appeared in person at campaign events during the coronavirus pandemic, slammed Mr. Trump&#8217;s failure to contain the outbreak in more personal terms than he has used before.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Eight months into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Donald Trump isn&#8217;t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can&#8217;t even take the basic steps to protect himself.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama, who set aside his lofty campaign style in a go-for-the-jugular moment, seized on a misstep, recalling that Mr. Trump told supporters on Tuesday at a rally in western Pennsylvania that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/us/trump-biden-election/trump-says-before-coronavirus-he-never-planned-on-campaigning-in-erie-pa-we-had-this-thing-won" title="">he would not have visited them</a> if his campaign had not been struggling.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The president spent some time in Erie last night and apparently he complained about having to travel here,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, laughing. &#8220;Then he cut the event short. Poor guy. I don&#8217;t feel that way. I love coming to Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Philadelphia in August, for the virtual Democratic National Convention, Mr. Obama delivered a televised speech that cast the election as an existential battle for the future of American democracy. He struck those same themes in his return visit on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He said that Mr. Trump&#8217;s antics were unacceptable and wouldn&#8217;t be tolerated if the person were a school principal, coach or even a family member.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Why would we expect and accept this from the president of the United States?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He warned Democrats not to let up because of the polling advantage Mr. Biden is now seeing and said that some had become &#8220;lazy&#8221; in 2016. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care about the poll,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, referring to Hillary Clinton&#8217;s polling lead. &#8220;There were a whole bunch of polls last time. It didn&#8217;t work out.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to out hustle the other side,&#8221; he added, as the Democratic horns began to honk in unison.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama is scheduled to hold his next event on Saturday in Miami, followed by another rally in Orlando next week, according to a Democratic official with knowledge of his plans.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Neil Vigdor</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-in-north-carolina-all-you-hear-is-covid-covid-covid-covid-covid"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-in-north-carolina-all-you-hear-is-covid-covid-covid-covid-covid">Trump in North Carolina: &#8216;All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="President Trump during a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/world/22elections-briefing-trump1/merlin_178864989_16ea5ba0-a261-41c3-ab3d-9f84dcfc712e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">President Trump during a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Doug Mills/The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump complained about the news media&#8217;s intensive coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday evening, describing the disease as an annoying inconvenience even as the country&#8217;s case count and death toll continue to soar.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Attacking two television networks, CNN and MSNBC, with barbed epithets, Mr. Trump insisted for the second night in a row, &#8220;That pandemic is rounding the corner.

It is not a perspective shared by most voters: A <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/biden-trump-times-poll.html" title="">national poll published Monday by The Times</a> found that 51 percent of likely voters believed the worst of the pandemic was yet to come, compared with 37 percent who said the worst was over.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And that was not the full extent of Mr. Trump&#8217;s dissembling on the pandemic. He repeated a familiar &#8212; and false &#8212; line claiming that the country only appears to have so many cases because there is so much testing, and telling supporters that his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was seeking to &#8220;prolong the pandemic&#8221; and &#8220;shut down your country,&#8221; even though the former vice president has presented a public-health agenda aimed at doing the opposite.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president also continued taunting Democratic governors who have imposed restrictions on gatherings and commercial activity to counter the spread of the virus, including North Carolina&#8217;s Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat seeking re-election whose popularity has risen in response to his handling of the pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You got to get your governor to open up your state here,&#8221; Mr. Trump said, prodding Mr. Cooper. &#8220;Open up your state, governor.

If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I called the police,&#8221; he said in a brief text exchange on Wednesday. &#8220;He and all his crew ran away leaving their equipment behind.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still photos and descriptions of the scene from those who have screened the movie say the heavily edited clip, in line with the actor&#8217;s signature mockumentary format, begins with Mr. Giuliani, seated on a couch answering questions. Soon after, the actress, who speaks with a heavy Eastern European accent, asks the former mayor if they can continue their discussion in the bedroom. Mr. Giuliani agrees, and is then shown sitting on a bed, as she appears to take his microphone off and he appears to pat her.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The segment then cuts to the image of Mr. Giuliani, reclining on the bed, placing his hands down the front of his pants.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I had to take off the electronic equipment,&#8221; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMGqi76ihb4&amp;feature=emb_logo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Giuliani told the hosts of the &#8220;Curtis &amp; Juliet Show.</a>&#8221; &#8220;And when the electronic equipment came off, some of it was in the back and my shirt came a little out, although my clothes were entirely on. I leaned back, and I tucked my shirt in, and at that point, at that point, they have this picture they take which looks doctored, but in any event, I&#8217;m tucking my shirt in. I assure you that&#8217;s all I was doing.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The scene ends with Mr. Cohen, dressed in an outlandish pink costume, bursting in to the room and shouting that the woman, played by the actor <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7210025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Bakalova</a>, was 15 years old (the actor is 24, according to the IMDb).</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Cohen was frightened by his call to the police, bolted away and left him talking with the filmmaker&#8217;s lawyer.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The former mayor is not the first Republican politician to be ensnared in one of Mr. Cohen&#8217;s cringe-inducing pranks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In 2018, Mr. Cohen tricked the former G.O.P. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama into giving him an interview for the Showtime satire show &#8220;Who Is America?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Later in 2018, a Republican lawmaker in Georgia <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/arts/television/jason-spencer-sacha-baron-cohen.html" title="">resigned after he was fooled into repeatedly yelling a racial epithet on Mr. Cohen&#8217;s Showtime series</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, accused Mr. Cohen of pretending to be a disabled veteran to land an interview with her, which she said was part of his repeated attempts to humiliate and &#8220;devalue&#8221; middle-class Americans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;He&#8217;s got a lot of people &#8212; Newt Gingrich,&#8221; added Mr. Giuliani, who insisted he was not taken in by Mr. Cohen. &#8220;He got Donald Trump before he was president.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Cohen&#8217;s new movie, &#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,&#8221; is scheduled to be released on Friday on Amazon Prime.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Glenn Thrush</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid4-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="democrats-have-a-contingency-plan-if-trump-prematurely-declares-victory-senator-says"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#democrats-have-a-contingency-plan-if-trump-prematurely-declares-victory-senator-says">Democrats have a contingency plan if Trump prematurely declares victory, senator says.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Senator Richard Blumenthal and&#160;Senator Kirsten Gillibrand " class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/21elections-blumenthal-Gillibrand/21elections-blumenthal-Gillibrand-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Senator Richard Blumenthal and&#160;Senator Kirsten Gillibrand </p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said that Democrats, anticipating that President Trump could declare victory before all the votes are counted in the election, have prepared for that exact scenario.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;There&#8217;s a plan to deal with it,&#8221; Mr. Blumenthal said on Wednesday night.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Blumenthal did not give any details of the plan, but told members of two grass-roots Democratic women&#8217;s groups during a Zoom call with his colleague, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, that there <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/us/politics/trump-power-transfer-2020-election.html" title="">could be a prolonged fight over the results</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The groups, Suburban Women Against Trump, which goes by the acronym S.W.A.T., and Joe Mamas, invited the two senators to speak about the election, the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You know that the right-wing echo chamber is going to be filled with disinformation about how they stole the election, how they stuffed ballot boxes, &#8216;we need to rebel,&#8217; &#8221; Mr. Blumenthal said. &#8220;That right wing is not America. It&#8217;s certainly not the America we know.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Both senators sharply criticized <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/amy-coney-barrett-what-we-learned.html" title="">Judge Barrett&#8217;s nomination</a> and said her all-but-certain confirmation to the conservative-leaning court threatened women&#8217;s reproductive rights and protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions who are covered under the Affordable Care Act.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Gillibrand, who ran unsuccessfully for president, said the landscape looked favorable for Democrats to take control of the White House and the Senate. The party should focus on voting rights and ethics if it is in the majority, she said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Weighing in on whether Democrats supported statehood for Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, Ms. Gillibrand said she would support it if they did.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;They have to decide what they want for themselves,&#8221; she said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Blumenthal, a frequent target of Mr. Trump&#8217;s Twitter barbs, said that his Republican colleagues had enabled the president.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;They are guilt-ridden because they know what they have done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have failed to stand up and speak out.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-struggling-bar-owner-in-a-biden-ad-also-happened-to-be-an-angel-investor-the-ad-disappeared"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-struggling-bar-owner-in-a-biden-ad-also-happened-to-be-an-angel-investor-the-ad-disappeared">A struggling bar owner in a Biden ad also happened to be an &#8216;angel investor.&#8217; The ad disappeared.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Joe Malcoun, who owns the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor, Mich., appeared in an ad for Joseph R.

It is shameful.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was not immediately clear if the Biden campaign knew of the bar owner&#8217;s background or not. A Trump campaign spokesman seized on the oversight.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;In their desperation to pin something else on the president, they fabricated a story in a last-ditch effort to lie to voters because nothing else has worked &#8212; and they got caught,&#8221; the spokesman, Ken Farnaso, said in an email on Wednesday night.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Malcoun, owns the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor, Mich., a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.blindpigmusic.com/history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">magnet for musicians for 50 years</a>, attracting acts from Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon to Pearl Jam and Nirvana.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There were cutaways in the ad to an idle microphone, bar stools turned upside down and beer taps gone dry.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Right now, it&#8217;s an empty room,&#8221; Mr. Malcoun said in the ad. &#8220;This is the reality of Trump&#8217;s Covid response.

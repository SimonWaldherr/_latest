Oklahoma City Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson and his brother raped a woman in 2018 after she refused the player’s repeated requests for a threesome, a new lawsuit claims.

The lawsuit, filed last month in Oklahoma County District Court, alleges an Oklahoma City woman was in a consensual relationship with Ferguson, 22, two years ago when he began pressuring her to have a threesome with his brother, Brandon Willis, The Oklahoman reported.

The woman “unequivocally rejected each and every one” of Ferguson’s offers to join him in bed with his brother, who lives in Dallas, according to the lawsuit.

She then turned down the invitation in September 2018 while at Ferguson’s home, where the NBA player made the request again, the lawsuit states.

That same day, Willis allegedly entered Ferguson’s bedroom as the pair were having consensual sex, frightening her as she withdrew consent from future sexual contact with Ferguson, according to the filing.

Ferguson ignored the woman’s wishes and told her to “shut up and get on [her] knees” before the 2017 first-round pick forced her to perform oral sex on him as his brother vaginally penetrated her, the lawsuit claims.

The woman claims Ferguson also filmed the sexual assault without her consent and shared the footage with others on Snapchat, leaving her with “physical, emotional and psychological” injuries, according to the filing.

Oklahoma County prosecutors in April declined to charge Ferguson after he was accused in the same apparent incident, The Oklahoman reported.

“Evidence to support the reporting person’s allegations that the sexual conduct was not consensual was absent,” District Attorney David Prater announced earlier this year.

An attorney who previously represented Ferguson did not return a message seeking comment Monday, The Oklahoman reported.

Attorney Billy Bock dismissed the allegations against Ferguson as “false” in April after prosecutors chose not to file charges in the alleged attack.

“He cooperated fully with the investigation and appreciates the professionalism of the investigators with the Oklahoma City Police Department and Mr. Prater’s office, which has declined to file charges,” Bock told the newspaper.

Willis is also being sued in the civil lawsuit, which seeks in excess of $500,000. It’s unclear if Willis or Ferguson have hired attorneys to represent them in the matter, The Oklahoman reported.

Ferguson just finished his third season with the Thunder after being selected in the 2017 NBA Draft.

Media critic: Journos for Censorship

“In a barely literate tweet that not once, but twice misspelled the word ‘its’ as ‘it’s,’ ” snarks The Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald, the New York Times Guild “denounced” one of its own colleagues, Bret Stephens, for his column criticizing the paper’s 1619 Project. In the short tweet, the union “impressively managed” to fit in “multiple ironies, fallacies and decrees typical of the petty tyrant.” “What kind of journalists plead with management for greater restrictions on journalistic expression rather than fewer?” After all, “journalism can have value only if it fosters divergent views and seeks to expand rather than reduce” freedom of expression. The Times guild previously called for “sensitivity readers” to vet pieces before publication, proving “a belief in free expression is being rapidly eclipsed.”

Pandemic journal: Sweden’s Critics Melt Down

“The better Sweden does” during the pandemic, “the angrier” critics become, marvels Dan Hannan at the Washington Examiner. “Lockdown enthusiasts” have now switched their argument from accusing Sweden of “genocide” for its laissez-faire approach to claiming “we couldn’t do that here because we’re nothing like Sweden.” Yet that’s “retrospective” justification. Yes, Sweden, as a whole, has a low population density, but 85 percent of its people live in 2 percent of its land. Yes, it’s had more deaths that other Nordic states, but it doesn’t “stick out like a sore thumb.” As for its slow economy despite its relaxed approach? “Nonsense”: Any “medium-sized country will be affected by a global downturn,” and “Sweden got off more lightly than most.” Truth is, Sweden is “rebuking” doubters by its success. “No wonder they get so angry.”

Religion desk: Kamala’s Anti-Catholic Hate

Kamala Harris’ record of bigotry makes her the “polemicist heir” of Paul Blanchard, the anti-Catholic scourge of John F. Kennedy’s election in the 1950s, asserts Kenneth Craycraft at First Things. The difference ­between the two is that Harris possesses the real power “and is campaigning for more to institutionalize her bigotry.” As the California attorney general, she championed a law that would have forced pro-life pregnancy centers to promote abortion and put six Catholic hospitals out of business. And as a US senator, she has repeatedly proved that she is “perfectly willing to impose unconstitutional religious tests to nominees to the federal bench.” Craycraft fears that based on Harris’ history “together with Joe Biden” — who defies church teaching on fundamental points — “never have two people with such open hostility to Catholic faith and practice been so close to the two highest offices in America.”

Centrist: DC Is Now ‘The Truman Show’

Washington increasingly seems like a remake of “The Truman Show,” snarks Jonathan Turley at The Hill, except “in this remake, the viewers are the voters in the dark.” Joe Biden’s refusal to answer questions about court packing “is a truly alarming position for a candidate to take.” Meanwhile, Democrats insist the report on “serious and possibly criminal conduct in the Russia investigation” be withheld until after Election Day — even though the “subjects of scrutiny are not candidates on this ballot, but rather federal officials involved in the investigation of potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016.” And in the Mike Flynn case, “Judge Emmet Sullivan appears to be waiting out on the election before issuing a final ruling.” Americans must wait for answers on all fronts — because DC insiders are behaving like “the master architect of the artificial world of the film.”

Conservative: The Flight 93 Election, Redux

At The American Mind, Michael Anton, the writer behind the infamous “Flight 93 Election” of 2016, warns that 2020 is equally an existential choice for conservatives. If President Trump loses, expect “more of all the trends, policies and practices that . . . enrich the ruling class and its foot soldiers at middle America’s expense, erode our natural and constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties, degrade our culture and its people and dishonor our heritage and history.”

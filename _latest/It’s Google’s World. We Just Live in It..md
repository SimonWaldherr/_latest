<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">About 20 years ago, I typed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000301105534/http://google.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google.com</a> into my web browser for the first time. It loaded a search bar and buttons. I punched in &#8220;D.M.V. sample test,&#8221; scrolled through the results and clicked on a site.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Wow, I thought to myself. Google&#8217;s minimalist design was a refreshing alternative to other search engines at the time &#8212; remember AltaVista, Yahoo! and Lycos? &#8212; which greeted us with a jumble of ads and links to news articles. Even better, Google seemed to show more up-to-date, relevant results.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">And the entire experience took just a few seconds. Once I found the link I needed, I was done with Google.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Two decades later, my experience with Google is considerably different. When I do a Google search in 2020, I spend far more time in the internet company&#8217;s universe. If I look for chocolate chips, for example, I <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/google-parent-company-alphabet-advertising.html" title="">see Google ads</a> for chocolate chips pop up at the top of my screen, followed by recipes that Google has scraped from across the web, followed by Google Maps and Google Reviews of nearby bakeries, followed by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html" title="">YouTube videos</a> for how to bake chocolate chip cookies.

Jason Derulo might be most synonymous with the sound of him singing his own name at the beginning of his songs.

And the Florida-born artist recently revived his vocal signature, after going without it for a few years.

He recently revealed the reasoning behind the little detail and why he brought it back, as he made a virtual appearance Friday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

Say my name: Jason Derulo recently revealed why he started singing his name at the beginning of his songs and why he brought it back, as he made a virtual appearance Friday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show

The 31-year-old told the host: 'Well, it’s a bigger hit if I sing my name at the front, you know, obviously. So, yeah, I had to bring that back.

'And I was actually wondering why other people didn’t sing my name at the front of their songs as well, because it worked so well for me. They should sing Jason Derulo at the front of their songs.'

He previously kept up the one-man trend in his single Take You Dancing, which dropped back in July.

'Will you sing my name right now?' Ellen asked, as he obliged: 'Ooh, yeah. By the way, people ask me to do this all the time, and I always tell them, "hell no." But you know, it's Ellen, so I'm gonna do it.'

Bigger hit: The 31-year-old told the host: 'Well, it’s a bigger hit if I sing my name at the front, you know, obviously. So, yeah, I had to bring that back'

Starting a trend: He added: 'And I was actually wondering why other people didn’t sing my name at the front of their songs as well, because it worked so well for me. They should sing Jason Derulo at the front of their songs'

She was pleased with the musical gift, adding: 'I love it... I'm gonna start my show like that every single day, because that's gonna help.'

Jason also opened up about his whirlwind romance with girlfriend Jena Frumes, 27, which has heated up during quarantine.

He said: 'I always say quarantine can either speed up a relationship, or it can speed up a breakup. You're spending so much time together, it's either great or it's not. So, it was the contrary for us, it's been going amazing.'

Make or break: He said: 'I always say quarantine can either speed up a relationship, or it can speed up a breakup. You're spending so much time together, it's either great or it's not. So, it was the contrary for us, it's been going amazing' (pictured in October, 2020)

The Talk Dirty artist began dating the YouTuber in March, when they started putting out TikTok videos together, and they've since been isolating together.

He's also been churning out some wildly popular clips with Will Smith, with whom he connected over the social media phenomenon.

Jason told Ellen: 'Will's team hit me up and was like, "Will is a fan of what you've been doing with all your content." And I was like, "Well, I'm a big fan too. Let's get together."

'And so, we started off with one video, and that went super crazy. And then we just kinda kept it going. It's been incredible, because he's always been somebody that I looked up to, growing up. So, to be doing all these crazy videos that people are loving is pretty awesome.'

Joe Biden continued his strong streak of fundraising on Wednesday, pulling in $12 million over the course of the day around the debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris.

The former vice president's big haul was first reported by Politico . ActBlue, the liberal fundraising platform, reported about $5 million in donations for Democratic candidates between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. Wednesday, according to CNBC . Capitalizing on a viral moment during the debate when a fly appeared on Pence's head, Biden used Twitter to urge supporters to "pitch in $5 to help this campaign fly."

The big day of donations comes just over a week after the Biden campaign announced that it broke its single-hour fundraising record during the first presidential debate – pulling in $3.8 million, Reuters reported . The campaign raised about $10 million total during the debate, according to Politico .

Biden has gained an overall fundraising edge over President Donald Trump in recent months. While neither campaign has announced its September figures yet, The Associated Press has reported that Biden broke his own record – set the month prior – for monthly fundraising. The campaign previously shattered the monthly fundraising record by pulling in about $364 million in August and also gaining a cash-on-hand advantage over Trump. The campaign is showing no signs of slowing down its push for cash either, with plans to host 53 fundraisers over 14 days, ABC News reported on Wednesday .

Trump raised about $210 million in August, falling well short of his opponent. His sinking fundraising numbers are seemingly not affecting the Republican Party as a whole, however. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that backs House Republicans, raised more than $77 million last quarter, which was more than double what it raised during the same quarter in 2018, according to Politico . America First Action, a super PAC that supports Trump, on Friday announced a $10 million advertising buy in Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

With a growing polling lead and cash advantage, Biden is making an aggressive play for Texas – normally a Republican stronghold – with his own ad buy worth approximately $6 million that will run until Election Day, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics. In contrast, the Trump campaign has been pulling back on television ads recently but is outspending the former vice president on Facebook with ads targeting some states the president won in 2016, according to CNBC .

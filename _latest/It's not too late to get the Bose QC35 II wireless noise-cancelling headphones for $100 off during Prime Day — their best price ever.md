Here's the short of it: If you've been looking for an affordable pair of premium wireless noise-cancelling headphones, you need to stop reading this and buy the Bose QuietComfort 35 II with the $200 deal on Amazon Prime Day 2020, now before it ends.

The popular and iconic Bose QC35 II noise-cancelling wireless headphones are still $100 off as deals wind down for Amazon Prime Day 2020, bringing the price tag down from the usual $300 to $200. That's the best price we've seen for the QC35 II, so this is an exceptional opportunity to snag one of the best sets of wireless noise-cancelling headphones on the market.

Indeed, we've only seen these go for as low as $280, maybe $270, in the past.

The QC35 II were first released in September 2017, which makes them slightly more than three years old. That's not old in headphone years, but nonetheless, Bose has released a newer set of wireless noise-cancelling headphones called the Bose 700, which cost $400.

Bose didn't discontinue the QC35 II, which means they're not considered the "old" model. Rather, the Bose 700 are in a newly minted "ultra-premium" category, while the QC35 II exist alongside them as the standard premium option. It was around the release of the Bose 700 in 2019 that the company reduced the retail price of the QC35 II from $350 to $300, and now they are even cheaper thanks to Prime Day.

Bose's QC35 IIs are still excellent headphones — especially for this deal price

The Bose QC series has been mostly unrivalled since it was first released, and it's usually the first set of headphones people think of when they're looking for noise-cancelling tech and great audio quality.

With the QC35 II headphones, you're getting deep, rich sound with a healthy dose of bass and balance of mids and highs. They're also incredibly comfortable headphones with plush and soft ear pads and plenty of room for your ears. Their noise cancelling is top-notch and only bested by Bose's own 700 headphones, and perhaps Sony's most recent $350 WH-1000XM4 headphones. And as for battery life, Bose's 20-hour claim seems pretty spot-on.

While the QC35 II are excellent, they're not entirely perfect. For one, I expected better build quality for a pair of headphones that used to cost $350. It's not bad, but they're made of light and hollow plastic that can easily scuff over time. But that's inconsequential to their primary function of being comfortable wireless noise-cancelling headphones.

Something else to note is that the QC35 II use the old microUSB standard for charging. It's only an issue if you've been ditching microUSB by upgrading your devices and accessories to those that use the newer USB-C standard. It might simply mean that you have to bring along a microUSB cable alongside USB-C cables.

There's no such thing as the perfect device, and this discount more than makes up for any complaints.

<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A Ukrainian fitness influencer with 1.1 million followers on Instagram has died of the coronavirus &#8211; after previously doubting the existence of the deadly bug, according to reports.</p>
<p>Dmitriy Stuzhuk, a buff 33-year-old who promoted healthy living, notified his fans of his diagnosis from his hospital bed, saying he woke up with breathing difficulties during a trip to Turkey and developed a cough the following day, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12954262/influencer-covid-dies-virus-turkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun reported</a>.</p>
<p>He was tested after returning to Ukraine and was diagnosed with the illness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was one who thought that COVID does not exist&#8230; until I got sick,&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGVXb6mHmEZ/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stuzhuk wrote on Instagram</a>. &#8220;COVID-19 IS NOT A SHORT-LIVED DISEASE! And it is heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that his condition was &#8220;stable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The hospital is completely filled with people, some of them being treated in corridors,&#8221; wrote Stuzhuk, who was allowed to leave the hospital after eight days but was rushed back soon after.</p>
<p>His ex-wife Sofia Stuzhuk, 25, the mother of his three kids, later announced that he was in &#8220;grave condition&#8221; and unconscious, according to the news outlet.</p>

 
	<p>&#8220;Dima (Dmitriy) had problems with his cardiovascular system&#8230; His heart is not coping,&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGcw8N5Agrc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote on Instagram</a>, where she has 5 million followers.</p>
<p>&#8220;His state is extremely grave. No one can do anything with this. I did everything I could so the father of my three children lives. But nothing depends on me now,&#8221; she added before announcing his death.</p>
<p>The couple &#8212; whose youngest child is just 9 months old &#8212; broke up six months ago amid &#8220;constant betrayal, cursing, showdown and stress&#8221; but recently said they were back on good terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only warm memories remain, three beautiful kids and valuable experience,&#8221; Sofia wrote. &#8220;God, it is so terrible to realize that he is not with us anymore&#8230;&#8221;</p>

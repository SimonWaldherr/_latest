<div><p>If anyone knows where Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s proverbial bodies are buried, it&#8217;s Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>But some of those old secrets could see the light of day Thursday, when <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/judge-wants-quick-unsealing-of-ghislaine-maxwell-sex-life-deposition/">a seven-hour deposition</a> given by Maxwell in 2016 is to be made public &#8212; offering new glimpses into Epstein&#8217;s years as a sexual predator.</p>
<p>The move comes as the globe-trotting 58-year-old British socialite cools her heels <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/07/ghislaine-maxwell-leaves-luxe-life-for-10-by-12-foot-jail-cell/">in a Brooklyn jail</a> awaiting trial for allegedly recruiting girls as young as 13 to feed her pedophile pal&#8217;s sexual appetite.</p>
<p>Here is a look at her life, her alleged exploits, and her potential fate as the case plays out.</p>
<h2>Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?</h2>
<p>Maxwell spent nearly 30 years as Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s lover, friend and accused accomplice in a wide-ranging sex-trafficking scheme that spanned years and allegedly ensnared scores of underage girls.</p>
<p>She became the primary target of federal investigators after Epstein&#8217;s suicide at the age of 66 inside Manhattan&#8217;s Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.</p>
 
<p>Maxwell is due to stand trial on two counts of perjury and four other counts related to the sex-trafficking scheme.</p>
<p>In addition, Maxwell is named in a number of civil lawsuits filed by alleged sex abuse victims.</p>
<p>While Maxwell&#8217;s net worth is uncertain, federal prosecutors identified as many as 15 bank accounts associated with her in July, worth anywhere from several hundred thousand dollars to more than $20 million each, <a href="https://time.com/5868402/ghislaine-maxwell-net-worth-mystery-epstein-trial/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time magazine reported</a>.</p>
<p>Just months before her arrest, she purchased a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/02/bradford-nh-facts-about-where-ghislaine-maxwell-was-arrested/">secluded New Hampshire property</a> for more than $1 million.</p>
<h2>Childhood and family</h2>

 
	<p>Maxwell, the youngest of nine siblings, was born in December 1961 in the shadow of her famous father, media mogul-turned-fraudster Robert Maxwell.</p>
<p>Raised in a lush, 53-room mansion in Oxfordshire, Maxwell was her dad&#8217;s favorite child, Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2020/02/28/long-before-ghislaine-maxwell-disappeared-came-her-mogul-fathers-mysterious-death/#6e3eee158694" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported in February.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;He was a monstrous father,&#8221; Roy Greenslade, who worked for the elder Maxwell as editor of the Daily Mirror in the 1990s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/02/europe/ghislaine-maxwell-profile-epstein-intl-gbr/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CNN in July</a>. &#8220;He treated his whole family very badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, Greenslade added, he &#8220;treated her more leniently than any of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, that lifestyle came to a screeching halt on Nov. 5, 1991, when her father, facing financial ruin, disappeared off the Canary Islands while on a luxury yacht christened &#8220;Lady Ghislaine&#8221; &#8212; named for his favorite child.</p>
<p>He reportedly left his daughter with a $100,000-a-year stipend. She relocated to the Upper East Side and was soon dating Epstein.</p>
<h2>Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
<p>According to one report, Robert had <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/03/ghislaine-maxwell-set-up-with-jeffrey-epstein-by-her-own-father/">introduced his daughter</a> to the disgraced financier several years earlier at a 1988 function in London, believing he would take care of his daughter&#8217;s &#8220;emotional&#8221; needs.</p>
<p>Robert may have <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/13/jeffrey-epstein-bankrolled-by-ghislaine-maxwells-conman-dad-report/">even been bankrolling</a> Epstein at the time, another report claimed.</p>
<p>Regardless, Maxwell and Epstein began dating shortly after she arrived in the Big Apple in 1991 &#8212; and thereafter remained close friends who were frequent guests at high-society gatherings that routinely had them hobknobbing with the rich and famous.</p>
<p>Epstein&#8217;s wealth allowed Maxwell to immerse herself in the luxurious lifestyle she grew up with in England.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Epstein benefited from rubbing elbows with Maxwell&#8217;s socialite connections, calling her his &#8220;best friend&#8221; in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2003 Vanity Fair article</a>, and adding that &#8220;she seems to organize much of his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several of Epstein&#8217;s victims have described Maxwell <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/18/ghislaine-maxwell-was-a-sexual-predator-alleged-victim-says/">as a &#8220;sexual predator&#8221;</a> who recruited young girls to please the wealthy pedophile and even schooled them on how to perform to his liking.</p>
<p>According to the Manhattan six-count federal indictment, the two developed a sordid, years-long partnership targeting young girls, who were sexually abused at various Epstein properties, including his Manhattan mansion and a private Caribbean island nicknamed &#8220;pedophile island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maxwell assisted, facilitated, and contributed to Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to Maxwell and Epstein to be under the age of 18,&#8221; the indictment said.</p>
<h2>Manhunt and arrest</h2>
 
<p>Maxwell&#8217;s longstanding friendship with Epstein continued following his 2008 sex trafficking conviction in Florida.</p>
<p>But when the disgraced financier was arrested again in July 2019 in Manhattan, she&#160;fell off the grid.</p>
<p>Her absence led to wild <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/02/where-in-the-world-was-ghislaine-maxwell/">speculation of her whereabouts</a>, with rumors circulating that she was hiding out in a submarine off the coast of the Virgin Islands, in a three-bedroom home in Teaneck, NJ, or shacking up in Brazil with modeling mogul Jean-Luc Brunel.</p>
<p>One report suggested Maxwell was hiding out in Israel under the protection of the Mossad, the infamous intelligence agency with whom her late father was once affiliated, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/07/inside-ghislaine-maxwells-life-on-the-lam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vanity Fair said in a report</a> in July.</p>
<p>In fact, federal investigators said she had spent months holed up in a secluded, 156-acre estate in New Hampshire she bought in December for just over $1 million &#8212; and where she was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/02/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-associate-arrested/">arrested on July 2</a>.</p>
<h2>Ghislaine&#8217;s rumored &#8216;list&#8217;</h2>

 
	<p>Since her arrest, speculation has run rampant over what Maxwell knows about Epstein&#8217;s escapades &#8212; and <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/04/whos-afraid-of-ghislaine-maxwell-everyone-on-this-list/">who else partook in them,</a> leading to rumors she has kept a &#8220;list&#8221; of people who took part in Epstein&#8217;s misdeeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure she has access to the videos,&#8221; TV host Christopher Mason, a Maxwell friend, said after her arrest in July. &#8220;A lot of powerful people will be more than a little worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of high-profile personalities have been linked to Epstein, with the pedophile&#8217;s accusers charging they were preyed on by Britain&#8217;s Prince Andrew and prominent attorney Alan Dershowitz &#8212; both of whom deny the allegations.</p>
<p>Photographs and flight logs from Epstein&#8217;s private jet &#8212; dubbed the &#8220;Lolita Express&#8221; &#8212; have linked former <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/09/photos-show-bill-clinton-ghislaine-maxwell-on-epsteins-lolita-express-jet/">President Bill Clinton</a>, Kevin Spacey, Naomi Campbell and President Trump to the plane. Though many have distanced themselves from Epstein and Maxwell, and none have been charged with any related crimes.</p>
<p>Maxwell, for her part, has remained mum &#8212; so far.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<p>While awaiting trial, Ghislaine Maxwell is being held under close watch at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she&#8217;s complained of &#8220;uniquely onerous conditions&#8221; through her lawyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day b security cameras and is under constant observation by multiple prison guards,&#8221; her attorney, Christian Everdell, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/18/maxwell-under-constant-surveillance-by-prison-psychologists-lawyer/">said in a letter in August</a>.</p>
<p>On Monday, a three-judge panel <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/ghislaine-maxwell-deposition-about-sex-life-will-be-made-public/">OK&#8217;d the release</a> of a 418-page, seven-hour deposition given by Maxwell in April 2016 as part of a since-settled civil defamation suit filed by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/judge-wants-quick-unsealing-of-ghislaine-maxwell-sex-life-deposition/">Manhattan judge on Tuesday</a> ordered that the deposition be unsealed &#8220;as soon as is practicable,&#8221; and set 9 a.m. Thursday as the deadline.</p>

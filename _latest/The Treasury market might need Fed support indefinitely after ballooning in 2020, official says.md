Purchases of roughly $80 billion of Treasurys a month have kept yields low even as unprecedented relief spending spikes the US budget deficit and brings a flood of new debt to market.</p><p>Yet economists fear what may happen when the central bank slows its pace of buying. With the government set to maintain hefty issuance for years, the Fed's support could be necessary to avoid a complete Treasury market collapse, Quarles said.</p><p>"It may be that there is a simple macro fact that the Treasury market, being so much larger than it was even a few years ago, much larger than it was a decade ago, and now really much larger than it was even a few years ago, that the sheer volume there may have outpaced the ability of the private-market infrastructure to kind of support stress of any sort there," he said in a virtual appearance on Wednesday. &#13;

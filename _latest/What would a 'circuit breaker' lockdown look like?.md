A national "circuit-breaker" lockdown was first proposed by the Government's Sage panel of scientific advisers in a list of "non-pharmaceutical interventions" last month.

At its meeting on September 21, Sage recommended a "circuit-breaker (short period of lockdown) to return incidence to low levels", falling short of the national lockdown imposed in March.

Although there was little further detail, the scientists said: "The more rapidly interventions are put in place, and the more stringent they are, the faster the reduction in incidence and prevalence and the greater the reduction in Covid-related deaths."

Personal freedoms

According to the minutes of Sage's meeting, the scientists recommended "banning all contact within the home with members of other households (except members of a support bubble)".

Some of these measures were implemented in England by the Government's three-tier strategy of local restrictions, which came into force on Wednesday.

<li>Her secret to success is against traditional rules of marketing &#8212; her photos are basic and her captions are spunky.</li>
<li>But it's her unique personality, passion for fashion, and dedication to customer service that's helped her make so much at only 21 years of age.</li>
<li>"The word 'Trust' is in my username," said Kol. "It's important that my customers can trust me."</li>

<p>Mika Kol, a.k.a., <a href="https://www.depop.com/trustfundgoth/">@TrustFundGoth</a>, has 17,000 followers on the popular clothing resale app <a href="https://www.depop.com/">Depop</a>. The 21-year-old business major is an enigma on the Instagram-look-alike platform, breaking nearly every rule of ecommerce.&#160;</p><p>"I'm not great at taking pictures," she shared. Rather than waste time trying to master photography, styling, and modelling, Kol took her shop in a different direction: low-quality images coupled with provocative, poetic captions.&#160;</p><p>Kol knows her Depop presence is confusing &#8212; are we meant to take "TrustFundGoth" seriously, or is it performance art? Either way, Kol's made more than $50,000 in profits since joining the app in December 2018, through listings that pull in 30% to 60% in profits.&#160;</p><p>Kol keeps her personal life a mystery, despite sharing blips of it in her captions on Depop. <a href="https://twitter.com/MeanMug_Mamii">On Twitter</a>, thousands of strangers gape at her outrageous antics, like <a href="https://www.depop.com/products/trustfundgoth-its-harder-than-it-looks">modelling a $350 vinyl vest brimming with her own cash</a>. Some criticize Kol for her ostensible wealth and privilege, while others call her "Queen."</p><p>

</p><p>It's an odd time for resale platforms, as some may pause buying and selling due to fears of coronavirus. On the other hand, many people left unemployed will be looking for new streams of income. When the time comes, here are Kol's secrets to a unique brand and listings that sell like hotcakes.</p><h2>Mimick Instagram influencers with 'intimate consumerism'&#160;</h2><p>Kol decided to use Depop in an experimental way &#8212; to create a parasocial relationship with her customers, mimicking the way Instagram influencers create an intimate bond with thousands of strangers.&#160;</p><p>Kol calls this "intimate consumerism." She lets her <a href="https://www.depop.com/products/trustfundgoth-currently-im-wearing-an-exes/">life influence her captions</a>, but she isn't beholden to the concrete authenticity expected from Instagram stars.&#160;</p><p>@TrustFundGoth's followers find humor and escapism in Kol's writing. "Sometimes I'm having a bad day," wrote one commenter, "but then I remember your account exists!"&#160;</p>

<p>Kol wanted to make a comedic Depop account so she'd have something to offer everyone, even if they couldn't afford her prices. This mission seems particularly prescient now, as we're in the midst of a pandemic. Everybody is looking for new forms of entertainment, and free content is more valuable than ever.&#160;</p><p>"People are social distancing," said Kol, "And a parasocial relationship keeps people clicking on my page."</p><h2>Buck the overdone, curated look for a more authentic profile</h2><p>Kol's initial goal for @TrustFundGoth was to create a vision board, so to speak. When photographing her items, Kol took careless shots &#8212; throwing a silk blouse on her floor and capturing the image with her shadow in frame.&#160;</p><p>These photos inspired to do something different from the typical curated Depop feed of high-quality photographs of models wearing trendy outfits, styled perfectly in front of a white backdrop.</p><p>"I feel like I don't have as much fun taking pictures, so I naturally just rush through them so that I can get to writing the caption," said Kol. Though, sometimes she finds inspiration for a clever caption while taking the photo. When she lived in an apartment on Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, she took photos in her building's stairwell and wrote captions about how her neighbors thought she was "so weird."</p><p>In May, Kol revised 157 captions to add more personal detail, and her profit margins and sales skyrocketed. She <a href="https://www.depop.com/products/trustfundgoth-vintage-margret-jerold-hot-air/">updated a listing for Ferragamo heels</a> that had been sitting unsold for months to include a joke about texting her ex-boyfriend. Adding that small detail helped the shoes sell in less than an hour, she said.&#160;</p><h2>Invest in product knowledge before you invest in the product</h2><p>Kol started reselling clothes in a Houston consignment shop as a teenager. She realized her collection of couture was worth way more than what the local shops could offer. Three years later, she joined Depop.&#160;</p><p>Kol's substantial inventory of vintage clothing put her at an advantage to other sellers on Depop. More importantly, she'd acquired an extensive knowledge of the fashion industry through trading and working behind the scenes at consignment stores. Kol made over $3,600 in her first month on the app. As enticing as this sounds, Kol stressed the value of patience in the fast-paced world of ecommerce.&#160;</p>

<p>"You won't succeed if you jump straight into an endeavor," said Kol. "You need a lot of in-field knowledge."&#160;</p><p>

</p><p>Kol calculated the risk and reward in buying certain designers. She bought tons of Vivienne Westwood and Jean Paul Gaultier couture at price points of $35 to $80 before those brands garnered "hype" among trendy, fashion-forward Gen-Z shoppers. Now, Gaultier mesh tops sell for $250, while Westwood's graphic print jeans go for $1,000.&#160;</p><p>"Part of what makes people think I'm some billionaire heiress is that they don't understand how those prices are arbitrary," said Kol. "I bought most of my collection when the demand was low and the supply was high."</p><p>Kol advises budding entrepreneurs to apply market and product research to their hustle. Kol makes regular assessments of her clientele, noting their average purchase price, the types of items they buy from other sellers, and overall trends. Choosing a hustle based on something you're already passionate about is ideal, Kol explained, since you'll naturally anticipate what the market wants and needs.&#160;</p><h2>Quality customer service has the greatest return</h2><p>Kol has a 4.9 star rating on Depop. She communicates frequently with sellers, fielding questions about items they're interested in and responding immediately on the app's messaging tool.&#160;</p><p>"The word 'Trust' is in my username," said Kol. "It's important that my customers can trust me."&#160;</p><p>Kol meticulously inspects items once they're sold before she sends them out. Occasionally, she'll find a flaw that hadn't been addressed in the product description and contact her customer if this happens, offering a full or partial refund. She said she's refunded close to $1,000 since starting on Depop, but it's a worthy investment in her business.&#160;</p><p>Establishing a reputation as a trustworthy seller is paramount for success on Depop, as the app rewards profitable sellers who offer great customer service. As of May, Kol joined the ranks of Depop's "Top Sellers," who are featured prominently on the app's homepage, the ecommerce advertising equivalent to a billboard in Times Square. In return, Top Sellers must meet certain financial requirements and maintain an average rating of 4.5 stars, shipping products out within 10 days of purchase.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>Like many other business owners, Kol's had to delay orders due to the pandemic. She's been compensating by sending a bonus item to customers who've waited longer than usual.&#160;</p><p>"I don't feel fulfilled until my customers are satisfied," said Kol.</p><p>This story was originally published on Business Insider June 6, 2020.</p>

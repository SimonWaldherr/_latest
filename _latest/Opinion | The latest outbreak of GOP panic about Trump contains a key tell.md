For these Republicans, the very existence of Trump&#8217;s authorship of this catastrophe cannot be acknowledged. So public revulsion over this sick and dying elephant in the room &#8212; and the role that&#8217;s playing in Trump&#8217;s travails &#8212; also cannot be conceded.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;A lot of Republican consultants are frustrated because we want the president&#8217;s campaign to be laser-focused on the economy,&#8221; one GOP strategist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/us/politics/trump-2020-campaign.html">tells the Times</a>, adding that the message should be that &#8220;Trump built a great economy&#8221; that has since been damaged by coronavirus.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Similarly, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-aides-seek-to-set-aside-division-and-plan-for-final-sprint-to-election-day/2020/10/17/09f8cf22-0fbf-11eb-8a35-237ef1eb2ef7_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_10">The Post reports</a> that aides believe focusing on the spectacular Trump economy before the pandemic hit &#8212; and promising that Trump would rebuild it &#8212; is his winning message.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In other words, the basic analysis Republicans offer here is that Trump&#8217;s presidency had been a towering success before an incidental outside disaster slammed into it, like a meteor from outer space.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Putting aside the absurdity of claiming Trump built a great economy &#8212; in reality he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/data-show-trump-didn-t-build-great-economy-he-inherited-n1237793">inherited</a> many of its trends &#8212; what Republicans cannot speak aloud is that Trump is likely to lose largely because of <i>his</i> <i>actual</i> <i>mismanagement</i> of the greatest public health crisis in modern times.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The closest Republicans come to acknowledging this is in the Times piece, which suggests they want Trump to do more to change voter &#8220;perceptions&#8221; of his handling of the virus. In this telling, <i>perceptions</i> are the only problem here, and recasting Trump&#8217;s actual performance simply requires sufficiently artful and properly focused messaging.</p><p><h3 class="font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod">Trapped in an &#8216;echo chamber&#8217;</h3></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Meanwhile, Trump is now obsessed with his new attack on emails allegedly from Hunter Biden.

They say Trump must avoid interrupting Biden so he reveals his true &#8220;doddering&#8221; self.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;All Trump has to do is give people permission to vote for him," one GOP source tells Axios, as if the past four years never happened and the only problem is that Trump isn&#8217;t letting his opponent&#8217;s negatives sink him.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">It&#8217;s true that all this shows that Trump is both overly prone to having faith in the fearsome power of right wing disinformation and that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/13/trump-admits-it-intervention-he-desperately-needs-isnt-going-come/?itid=lk_inline_manual_26" target="_blank">he&#8217;s trapped in 2016, a blissful time</a> when he was the largely unknown outsider that undecided voters might take a chance on over an opponent who had been defined negatively in the public eye for decades.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">But what&#8217;s missing is an acknowledgment of the <i>real reason</i> it&#8217;s such a problem for him that this isn&#8217;t 2016 anymore. It isn&#8217;t just that Biden is proving far harder to define negatively than Hillary Clinton, though this is the case (which is another deeply dispiriting story in its own right).</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">It&#8217;s also that Trump is the incumbent this time, and he has a record to defend. It&#8217;s a record of extraordinary failure, and the coronavirus is at the center of it.</p><p><h3 class="font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod">A spectacular failure as president</h3></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Majorities <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/Fox_October-3-6-2020_Complete_National_Topline_October-7-Release-1.pdf">don&#8217;t believe</a> the virus is under control now and <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/Fox_October-3-6-2020_Complete_National_Topline_October-7-Release-1.pdf">want</a> more government action to rein it in even if that slows the recovery, rejecting Trump&#8217;s central story of the moment. Voters think Biden will better handle the virus <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/10/06/rel12b.-.2020.pdf">by large margins</a>. Approval of Trump&#8217;s handling of it <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/">is at a near-low</a>, rivaling where it stood amid the last coronavirus peak.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Indeed, this comes as we may be heading into a third peak.

With the markets near all-time highs, IPOs boom­ing and dealmaking such as Morgan Stanley’s purchase of Eaton Vance picking up, it would seem like layoffs would be the last thing that big banks and investment houses are weighing.

But those who run Wall Street never let a serious crisis go to waste. Cutting jobs is exactly what every major firm is looking at as the pandemic continues to ravage the US economy.

Of course, the big banks aren’t bragging about firing employees, many of whom live and work in New York City and the surrounding area. Overall, the financial sector employs around 500,000 people here, meaning these cuts, if and when they come, will make balancing the city’s pandemic-stricken budget even more difficult.

Good thing for our inept New York leadership that Wall Street has largely taken a pledge to delay any significant job cuts because of COVID-19 dis­locations. Goldman Sachs has been somewhat of an outlier, but the firm normally cuts underperformers toward the end of the year, as it announced a couple of weeks ago.

But for most of the banks, there’s simply no need to wield the ax just yet. While large swaths of American businesses have been decimated by the pandemic and the lockdowns that followed, Wall Street has been the prime beneficiary of the biggest stimulus plan ever enacted thanks to the Federal Reserve and its various methods of providing “liquidity” to the economy.

Liquidity is a fancy way of saying free money, so when the Fed prints it through its manifold monetary policy methods, the banks get first crack at the cash before it filters down to small businesses in the form of lower interest rates.

So while a mom-and-pop store on Main Street has to wait for liquidity to filter down in the form of cheap loans (or the so-called PPP COVID-loan program), the big banks remain open for business — and then some.

With interest rates at zero, they began borrowing cheaply, trading commodities, and providing advice on mergers, acquisitions and IPOs, which is exactly why bank profits are up while stores on Main Street remain shuttered.

But the good times won’t last forever, senior executives at the big banks tell me, and that’s why their bean-counters, as they slowly filter back to their Manhattan offices, are starting to look at what’s euphemistically known as “headcount.”

How much they will cut is open for debate. Veteran banking analyst Dick Bove told Lydia Moynihan at Fox Business that he expects the cuts to be significant. Bove says that Fed pandemic relief for Wall Street papered over trends that will eventually cause the firms to cut staffing because they simply don’t need as many bodies.

“I can see a 20 percent to 30 percent decrease in jobs over the next couple of years probably beginning” later this year, Bove said. “This is a long-term issue but the coronavirus didn’t help.”

He points to several trends, including how many companies are eschewing the public-offering process for “direct list­ings” that will lead to fewer IPOs and fewer bankers to complete deals.

Senior executives with whom I spoke at the big banks wouldn’t go as far as Bove’s estimate, but they also wouldn’t discount it either.

After taking earnings hits during the early days of the pandemic, firms like Goldman and JPMorgan are seeing a recent surge in revenue from trading and investment banking thanks to the Fed’s actions. But they concede Fed assistance will only last so long, and that without a complete reopening of the US economy, more businesses will close and loan volume will plummet, thus cutting into earnings and forcing layoffs.

Moreover, if Joe Biden is elected with a Congress controlled by Democrats, the regulatory environment will change, meaning possibly fewer deals and mergers because of height­ened antitrust scrutiny and, yes, fewer bankers completing those deals.

“Let’s just say when it comes to layoffs, we’re in a wait-and-see mode,” said one senior executive at a major bank, looking to put the best possible spin on a difficult job outlook.

In other words, Wall Street job cuts are coming — it’s just a matter of time and magnitude.

Cohen’s on the plate

The talk in baseball land is that billionaire hedge-fund trader Steve Cohen still needs to convince some MLB owners to approve his $2.4 billion purchase of the Mets.

But thanks to Ron Rosa, the owner of the swanky Polpo Restaurant in Greenwich, he appears to have secured at least one of those votes over dinner a couple of weeks ago.

Rosa was escorting Cohen to his table when he happened to notice investor and LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly sitting nearby. So he introduced the two, who hit it off. “Steve needs the owners to approve so I thought I would make the intro,” Rosa told me.

Cohen, of course has caused controversy in baseball circles with his Mets bid because some people at his firm have been charged with insider trading. (Cohen himself was never charged.) He needs 23 of the 29 baseball owners to approve his purchase, and as I have reported, he appears to have the votes.

His hedge fund, Point72 Asset Management, and Boehly’s Eldridge Industries investment firm are both located in Greenwich, and they are regular patrons of the popular eatery. Also in attendance was Judge Judy Sheindlin, who spoke with both men, though it’s unclear how much she helped Cohen’s cause.

Press officials for Boehly and Cohen declined to comment. A Sheindlin rep confirmed she was in attendance and said hello.

<div><p>Eat Just partners with Proterra to launch a new subsidiary in Asia</p><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ju.st/en-us">Eat Just</a>, the plant-based food startup, is launching a new Asian subsidiary through a partnership with <a href="https://www.proterrapartners.com/">Proterra Investment Partners Asia</a>. The agreement includes building Eat Just&#8217;s first factory in Asia, which will be based in Singapore.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Proterra, which focuses on agri-tech, will invest up to $100 million in the facility, while Eat Just will invest $20 million. The new subsidiary, called Eat Just Asia, will focus on creating a fully-integrated supply chain, working with manufacturers and distributers for Eat Just&#8217;s flagship product, vegan egg substitute Just Egg, which is made from mung beans.</p>
<p>In addition to Just Egg, Eat Just and Proterra said they are also in talks to expand their partnership to include the development of plant-based meat alternatives.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>Eat Just Asia also received support from the Singaporean government&#8217;s Economic Development Board.</p>
<p>Eat Just&#8217;s current distribution partners in Asia include SPC Samlip in South Korea, Betagro in Thailand and an as-of-yet undisclosed new partner in China, where Just Egg is already available on Alibaba&#8217;s Tmall and JD.com.</p>
<p>Based in San Francisco and formerly known as Hampton Creek, Eat Just has received total of about $220 million in funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/just-inc">according to Crunchbase</a>. Its investors include Khosla Ventures and Li Ka-Shing.</p>
<p>Eat Just announced in March that it <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200318005182/en/Expands-Partnerships-Globally-Raises-Capital-Adds-Coca-Cola">will focus on global expansion this year</a>, with partnerships in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Over the following months, it announced a succession of distribution deals for Just Egg, including ones with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200518005143/en/Announces-Groundbreaking-Partnership-Post-Holdings%E2%80%99-Michael-Foods">American food manufacturer and distributor Michael Foods</a>, a subsidiary of Post Holdings, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200513005764/en/European-Food-Manufacturer-Emsland-Group-Partner-Scale">European plant-based food manufacturer Emsland Group</a>.</p>
<p>In Asia, demand for plant-based protein foods grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, due in part to concerns about the safety of meat and other animal products. In <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-asia-food-idUSKCN224047">an April 2020 Reuters article</a>, Eat Just said sales of Just Egg on JD.com and Tmall had grown 30% since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak.</p>

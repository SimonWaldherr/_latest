  FBI investigates threatening emails sent to voters that claimed to be from Proud Boys 
description: > 
  Authorities are investigating emails sent to Democratic voters across the United States claiming to be from the Proud Boys and demanding that they 'vote for Trump' or else.Enrique Tarrio, chairman of the Proud Boys and the Florida state director of Latinos for Trump, placed distance between the group and the emails.He added that the Proud Boys use two sites and had been working to get away from the domain used in the email campaign.Given the public profile of the Proud Boys and the likelihood that whoever's sending these emails has access to a voter file, this appears to be opportunism.'Proud Boys is a far-right organization that admits only men as members and promotes and engages in political violence.

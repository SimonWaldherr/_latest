Margaret Nolan, iconic for her role as Dink in the James Bond film “Goldfinger,” has died at 76.

Her son, Oscar Deeks, confirmed the news that she had passed away on October 8, Variety reported. She is also survived by another son, Luke O’Sullivan

The former glamour model, who briefly posed under the name Vicky Kennedy, also gained fame for her role in the Beatles movie “Hard Day’s Night,” and in the family comedy “Carry On” film franchise.

After her sensual performance next to Sean Connery’s James Bond in “Goldfinger” in 1964, the blonde bombshell would later go on to pose for Playboy.

Director Edgar Wright also shared the news on Twitter.

“It’s my sad duty to report that actress and artist, the magnificent Margaret Nolan has passed away,” he wrote on Sunday.

“She was the middle of Venn diagram of everything cool in the ’60s; having appeared with The Beatles, been beyond iconic in Bond and been part of the Carry On cast too.”

In a thread, he continued, “She was the gold-painted model in the iconic Goldfinger title sequence and poster (she also played Dink in the movie), she appeared in the classic ‘A Hard Day’s Night,’ ‘Carry On Girls,’ ‘No Sex Please We’re British’ & many others, frequently sending up her own glamourpuss image.”

“I worked with her last year as she plays a small role in ‘Last Night In Soho.’ She was so funny, sharp and, as you might imagine, full of the most amazing stories. I’m so glad I got to know her,” said Wright, who cast Nolan in her final role in 2019.

“My heart goes out to her family and all that loved her. She will be much missed,” he added.

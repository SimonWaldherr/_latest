The Government must lift the secrecy surrounding the "opaque" body guiding the local lockdowns enforced on millions of people across the country, senior MPs and scientists have said.

Ministers have been urged to make public the advice given by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, a new body set up in May to lead the response to Covid-19.

Led by a senior spy, the JBC has never published details of its deliberations or any list of its key personnel.

Greg Clark, the chairman of the science and technology committee, said the public "deserve answers" on the JBC if the Government is to maintain trust in its decision-making.

"The transparency of the JBC is simply not good enough at the moment. Its role in the response to the pandemic is far too opaque, and that needs to change," he told The Telegraph. "These are important questions to which the public deserve answers."

Earlier this year, the Government was forced to publish the full membership of the Sage scientific committee and regular details of its advice to ministers after a row over transparency. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, later agreed it had been "an error" not to be more open with the public.

The JBC was formed to handle the surveillance of Covid-19 at a local level and consolidate the advice given to ministers.

It reports to Baroness Dido Harding, the chief of NHS Test and Trace, and holds responsibility for setting the national alert level as well as recommending action to contain outbreaks, including the closure of workplaces, pubs and restaurants.

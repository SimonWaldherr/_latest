President Donald Trump promised on Sunday that 'breathtaking' new documents would soon be made public, relating to the events leading up to the Mueller probe.

Trump has already vowed to declassify all information surrounding the investigation into the Trump campaign's relationship with Russia.

On Sunday the president told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that the documents proved the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton had tried to set him up.

Trump said on Sunday documents will be released relating to Clinton and the FBI investigation

Donald Trump spoke by photo to Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday morning

'Documents are being released at a level now that nobody's ever seen before,' he said.

'Things that nobody thought were going to get released have been released and you're seeing it all the time. You see what's going on.

'We caught them cold, we have them cold.'

Trump has in recent weeks grown increasingly vocal in his demands that Obama, Clinton and Obama-era intelligence chiefs should be prosecuted for their role in the investigation.

'And now they have to do something about it, but other documents are going to be released, Maria, which are breathtaking. Wait until you see what's coming out,' the president said.

Bartiromo asked if the new documents would be about the FBI's role or Clinton's.

'It's about everything,' he said.

'Hillary Clinton is "Crooked Hillary." I don't call her 'Crooked Hillary' for nothing.'

President Donald Trump promised on Sunday that 'breathtaking' new documents would soon be made public, relating to the events leading up to the Robert Mueller (pictured) probe

Trump on October 6 had tweeted that he authorized the declassification of all documentation relating to the 2016 operation, known as Crossfire Hurricane.

The intelligence authorities suspected that figures connected to Trump's campaign were soliciting help from Russia.

Trump said that he has 'fully authorized' the total declassification of any and all documents pertaining to Russia collusion, calling the investigation a 'hoax.'

'I have fully authorized the total Declassification of any & all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the Russia Hoax,' he said.

'Likewise, the Hillary Clinton Email Scandal. No redactions!'

He later added: 'All Russia Hoax Scandal information was Declassified by me long ago. Unfortunately for our Country, people have acted very slowly, especially since it is perhaps the biggest political crime in the history of our Country. Act!!!

Trump gave the green light to Attorney General Bill Bar to declassify any documents related to the surveillance of Trump's campaign in 2016.

John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence, declassified notes from former CIA Director John Brennan that showed that former Obama was briefed on a 'plan' to tie Trump to Russia as a 'means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server' ahead of the 2016 election.

Trump tweeted on October 6 that he had approved the declassification of the documents

Trump described it as 'perhaps the biggest political crime in the history of our Country'

'Today, at the direction of President Trump, I declassified additional documents relevant to ongoing Congressional oversight and investigative activities,' Ratcliffe said in a statement.

The notes were taken after Obama had been briefed on the matter, a source familiar with the matter shared.

Trump, during his October 6 Twitter frenzy, called for the prosecution of people connected to the investigation.

He was angry that not enough coverage was being given to the issue, saying: 'Media is in on it'.

He continued: 'So I had to constantly fight off all of this Scum, achieve more than any other President in First Term, and then they talk Chaos. They created crimes against me and this administration!'

He then said of the FBI investigators: 'Can't believe these con men are not yet being PROSECUTED. Pathetic!'

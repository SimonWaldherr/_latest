Add North Carolina to the list of states where a massive show of voter enthusiasm is marking the first days of early voting this year.

As early in-person voting got underway across the North Carolina on Thursday, voters stood in hours-long lines but said they were determined for their voices to be heard and votes to be counted at the first available chance.

By 11:30 a.m. more than 76,000 had cast ballots in person, according to State Board of Elections spokesman Patrick Gannon — setting a trajectory for a record-breaking first day of early voting.

Even before polls opened, the line to vote at a library on Charlotte’s Beatties Ford Road, in a predominantly Black neighborhood, had stretched around the parking lot and spilled onto a sidewalk.

Most said they’d come on the first morning simply because they like casting their ballots early and in person. But several also cited the crucial nature of this contest — “the most important election of my lifetime,” as retiree Eric Craig, 62, described it.

“I think a lot of it is not because they like Biden,” Craig said of those who braved the lines Thursday. “It’s just that we have to get [Trump] out.”

In most states, early voting gets busier in its final days, usually over the weekend before the election. That may still prove to be the case this year as Nov. 3 approaches, but the surge in voter interest at the front end shows the potential for historic turnout, officials said.

A survey of early and mail balloting so far in states that publish partisan affiliation shows a 2-to-1 Democratic advantage. Polls have shown that most Democrats plan to vote before Election Day, either by mail or in person, while most Republicans plan to vote in person Nov. 3.

Both Georgia and Texas began early in-person voting this week, with voters standing in long lines in multiple counties.

In Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the long lines were caused in part by slow check-in stations where electronic polling books were working sluggishly. Election officials said the system was overwhelmed by the turnout but that the issue should be resolved quickly.

All told, more than 17.3 million Americans had cast their votes by lunchtime Thursday, according to the Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who tracks early and mail balloting at his website, the United States Election Project.

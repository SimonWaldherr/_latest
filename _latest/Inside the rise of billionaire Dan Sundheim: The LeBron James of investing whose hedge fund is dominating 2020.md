The world has changed drastically in the two years since D1 Capital launched.

And Dan Sundheim has made money through it all, thanks to a string of bets that have emerged as winners in the new normal. The Wharton grad now has at least $1 billion in personal wealth between his assets in his firm, stake in the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, real-estate portfolio, and art collection.

The former Viking Global Investors chief investment officer started trading at D1 in July 2018 with more than $5 billion — including more than $500 million of his own money — and hasn't looked back.

Business Insider earlier this month took a look at the rise of Sundheim, based on conversations with a dozen of his college classmates, coworkers, and people who've invested with him. They revealed a whip-smart, mild-mannered colleague who had early flashes of investing brilliance.

"I think of Dan like LeBron James. Whatever team he is on is going to be a contender because he makes everyone else around him so much better," one of Sundheim's former Viking colleagues told Business Insider.

<p>The president spoke one day after CBS&#8217;s 60 Minutes aired an interview with Fauci, 79, in which he said he was &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; surprised Trump contracted the coronavirus himself, because he was holding crowded events with minimal social distancing and mask usage in the days before he developed symptoms.</p>
<p>Fauci also told CBS the White House had been controlling his media appearances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly have not been allowed to go on many, many, many shows that have asked for me,&#8221; he said, adding that restrictions had been inconsistent.</p>
<p>Trump said: &#8220;Every time he goes on television, there&#8217;s always a bomb, but there&#8217;s a bigger bomb if you fire him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president also acknowledged that reporters were listening in to the call. But he seemed unconcerned about his attacks on Fauci being made public.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a reporter on, you can have it just the way I said it, I couldn&#8217;t care less,&#8221; Trump said.</p>
<p>The president said Fauci was a &#8220;nice guy&#8221;, but said he had &#8220;been here for 500 years&#8221;. Fauci has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, serving six presidents.</p>
<p>More than 8m cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the US and nearly 220,000 people have died. Case numbers have risen to their highest levels since July, as a majority of states struggle to contain the virus. Fauci has said the US is not experiencing a second wave, because it never managed to contain the first.</p>

Donald Trump

</blockquote>

<p>Two weeks from election day, Trump trails Joe Biden in national and most battleground state polls and also in polls regarding public trust to handle the pandemic. He also trails Fauci: according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/upshot/coronavirus-americans-trust-experts.html" class="u-underline">a New York Times/Siena College survey</a> taken in June, 67% of American voters say they trust Fauci as a source of information on the pandemic while just 26% say the same of Trump.</p>
<p>On Monday, the president was in Arizona for two scheduled rallies. On the campaign call, he claimed without evidence that the death toll would have been as high as 800,000 if he had followed Fauci&#8217;s advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fauci is a disaster,&#8221; he insisted, adding: &#8220;People are tired of coronavirus. People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, the Trump campaign used comments from Fauci in an ad which praised Trump&#8217;s pandemic response. The doctor protested, saying the ad &#8220;clearly implies strongly that I&#8217;m endorsing a political candidate, and I have not given them my permission to do that&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;The quote that they took is completely out of context.&#8221;</p>
<p>News of Trump&#8217;s comments on the campaign call came as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/scott-atlas-twitter-removal-false-coronavirus-tweet" class="u-underline">the Washington Post</a> reported that White House coronavirus task force members led by Dr Deborah Birx had sought the firing of Dr Scott Atlas, a Stanford scientist and Fox News contributor who has gained the president&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>Atlas opposes accepted anti-Covid measures. At the weekend, Twitter removed a message from Atlas which said masks did not work to combat the virus. Trump has made similar claims.</p>

Trips to the grocery store. Late-night conversations on the phone. Tearful firsts with a newborn baby.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Staggering as the 220,00 number is, it may not fully capture the true toll of the pandemic, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.18.20214783v1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent analysis</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tabulating the ages of Americans known to have died of Covid-19, and tallying the number of years they might have lived had they reached a typical life expectancy, the report concluded that the virus had claimed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/health/coronavirus-statistics-deaths.html" title="">more than 2.5 million years of potential life in the United States</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Think of everything that a person does in a year,&#8221; said the author of the report, Stephen Elledge, a geneticist at Harvard. &#8220;Who among us would not give anything to have one more year with a parent, a spouse, a son or daughter, a close friend?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The report, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, comes as 37 states continue to see sustained increases in new infections, according to a New York Times database. Twelve have been roughly flat over the past couple of weeks. Only Hawaii is seeing consistent declines. On Wednesday, at least four states broke their single-day records for new cases reported.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Just last week, scientists published a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/world/white-house-embraces-a-declaration-from-scientists-that-opposes-lockdowns-and-relies-on-herd-immunity.html" title="">high-profile and discredited declaration</a> arguing that businesses and schools should be quickly opened and that people &#8220;who are not vulnerable&#8221; to the virus &#8212; presumably the young and healthy &#8212; should return to &#8220;life as normal&#8221; while older Americans remain cloistered from the coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Elledge&#8217;s analysis found that nearly half of the years lost were taken from people younger than 65.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;These are everyday people who are dying,&#8221; said Dr. Utibe Essien, a physician and health equity researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was not involved in the analysis. &#8220;They&#8217;re losing time with their kids, their grandkids, their opportunities to build their futures.&#8221; Dr. Essien was one of several experts who reviewed the study at the request of The New York Times.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-j--wu" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="forgotten-on-the-presidential-campaign-schools-in-crisis"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#forgotten-on-the-presidential-campaign-schools-in-crisis">Forgotten on the presidential campaign: Schools in crisis.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="An elementary school in the Bronx.

Superintendents are warning of drastic budget cuts on the horizon. Teachers&#8217; unions are calling for standardized tests to be canceled for a second straight year. And millions of children are learning remotely &#8212; with little known about the long-term effects on their intellectual growth.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Yet none of this has been a big campaign talking point for either President Trump or former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It should really be a pivotal topic,&#8221; said Kisha Hale, principal of the upper grades at Eagle Academy Public Charter School in Washington.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Just this week, parents in one major city school system &#8212; Boston&#8217;s &#8212; had hopes dashed that their pre-K and kindergarten children might soon find themselves back in the classroom. With cases rising, the city <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/21/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates/i-am-heartbroken-that-today-we-have-to-close-our-doors-bostons-schools-freeze-their-reopening-plans" title="">put a hold on its school reopening plans</a> and even ended what little in-person teaching there already was, for so-called high-needs students.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was a microcosm of the disarray across the country as school districts try to get back to normal, or something resembling it. Several recent polls have suggested that the issue is a leading concern for many voters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With the lives of schoolchildren upended across the country, the presidential campaign&#8217;s lack of focus on the issue has frustrated parents and educators alike.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The subject of school reopening is not a major theme of either candidate&#8217;s ad campaigns, and it got less than a minute of airtime at the first debate between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump last month. Nor is it among the topics that Kristen Welker of NBC News plans to question them on at Thursday&#8217;s debate, though &#8220;Fighting Covid-19&#8221; is.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">To the dismay of parents and educators, the discussion has been limited partly because states and local districts have a larger role than the federal government in running &#8212; and funding &#8212; schools.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">When Mr. Trump brings up schools at rallies, he can generally be counted on to say that he will fight for school choice and protect charter schools. And he has consistently called for schools to reopen, threatening at one point to withhold federal funds from districts that resist. But he has said little to nothing about the role of federal funding in helping districts reopen safely.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has presented ideas on how and when school districts should reopen. But he has not addressed the divisions that exist within his own party about what conditions need to be in place before sending students and teachers back to classrooms.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Nor has either campaign put forth ideas on improving remote learning, or on how colleges should handle the return to campuses &#8212; deeply relevant issues to huge slices of the electorate.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/abby-goodnough" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="osha-is-under-fire-over-its-regulation-of-meatpacking-plants-where-significant-covid-19-outbreaks-have-occurred"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#osha-is-under-fire-over-its-regulation-of-meatpacking-plants-where-significant-covid-19-outbreaks-have-occurred">OSHA is under fire over its regulation of meatpacking plants, where significant Covid-19 outbreaks have occurred.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Beatriz Rangel, center, at the grave of her father Saul Sanchez, a JBS employee who died of Covid-19 in April after an outbreak at the meat processing plant in Greeley, Colo.

JBS and the owner of the second plant, Smithfield Foods, combined to take in tens of billions of dollars worldwide last year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/business/economy/osha-coronavirus-meat.html" title="">The meat industry has gotten the relatively light touch</a> even as the virus has infected thousands of its workers &#8212; including more than 1,500 at the two facilities in question &#8212; and dozens have died.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The disparity in the way OSHA has treated health care and meatpacking is no accident. In April, the agency <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.osha.gov/memos/2020-04-13/interim-enforcement-response-plan-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would largely avoid inspecting workplaces in person outside a small number of industries deemed most susceptible to coronavirus outbreaks, like health care, nursing homes and emergency response.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/noam-scheiber" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-in-north-carolina-all-you-hear-is-covid-covid-covid-covid-covid"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-in-north-carolina-all-you-hear-is-covid-covid-covid-covid-covid">Trump in North Carolina: &#8216;All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="President Trump during a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/world/22elections-briefing-trump1/merlin_178864989_16ea5ba0-a261-41c3-ab3d-9f84dcfc712e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">President Trump during a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Doug Mills/The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump complained about the news media&#8217;s intensive coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday evening, describing the disease as an annoying inconvenience even as the country&#8217;s case count and death toll continue to soar.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Attacking two television networks, CNN and MSNBC, with barbed epithets, Mr. Trump insisted for the second night in a row, &#8220;That pandemic is rounding the corner. They hate it when I say it.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,&#8221; Mr. Trump said, repeating the word 11 times. &#8220;That&#8217;s all they put on, because they want to scare the hell out of everyone.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump&#8217;s lament about television news followed a familiar line in his recent speeches, insisting in defiance of all evidence that the coronavirus is rapidly disappearing as an issue. It is not a perspective shared by most voters: A national poll published Monday by The New York Times found that 51 percent of likely voters believed the worst of the pandemic was yet to come, compared with 37 percent who said the worst was over.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And that was not the full extent of Mr. Trump&#8217;s dissembling on the pandemic. He repeated a familiar &#8212; and false &#8212; line claiming that the country only appears to have so many cases because there is so much testing, and telling supporters that his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was seeking to &#8220;prolong the pandemic&#8221; and &#8220;shut down your country,&#8221; even though the former vice president has presented a public-health agenda aimed at doing the opposite.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president also continued taunting Democratic governors who have imposed restrictions on gatherings and commercial activity to counter the spread of the virus, including North Carolina&#8217;s Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat seeking re-election whose popularity has risen in response to his handling of the pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You got to get your governor to open up your state here,&#8221; Mr. Trump said, prodding Mr. Cooper. &#8220;Open up your state, governor.

The number is the largest jump in a 24-hour period since the country began publicly tracking cases in early March and the first time that Germany &#8212; widely lauded for its <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/europe/coronavirus-merkel-germany.html" title="">ability to manage the pandemic</a> &#8212; broke the 10,000 mark. The country&#8217;s seven-day case average is now above 7,200 cases, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">a New York Times database</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose health minister tested positive on Wednesday hours after a meeting with other members of her government, had urged Germans to &#8220;meet far fewer people&#8221; and &#8220;stay at home,&#8221; but did not announce any official nationwide restrictions.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Leading economists have warned that a nationwide lockdown, as took place in March and April, would be fatal to the country&#8217;s economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicted would fall by 6 percent this year because of the pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Most of the new cases can be traced to private meetings and celebrations, such as weddings or birthday parties, Dr. Lother Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany&#8217;s public health authority, said at a news conference on Thursday. Young people now account for most of the new cases, he said, but they are increasingly spreading it to those who are older than 60.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Those places where people are eager to come together and do so intensively,&#8221; are the places where the infection is currently spreading, Dr. Wieler said. &#8220;Where people sit closely together and laugh and are enjoying themselves, that is where the virus spreads intensively.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Several weeks ago, many Germans scoffed at Ms. Merkel&#8217;s warning that if they did not change their behavior, the country could see the number of daily new infections rise to as many as 19,000 per day. On Thursday, the head of the Federal Association of Physicians of German Public Health Departments, Ute Teichert, said she was one of them. &#8220;But the way that things are going, I now see that as a realistic estimate.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Germany has recorded 392,049 total cases and 9,905 deaths.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="no-mouthwash-will-not-save-you-from-the-coronavirus-despite-that-study-going-around"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#no-mouthwash-will-not-save-you-from-the-coronavirus-despite-that-study-going-around">No, mouthwash will not save you from the coronavirus, despite that study going around.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Scientists say that since the study didn&#8217;t recruit any human volunteers to gargle the products in question, the findings have limited value for the real world." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/science/22virus-briefing-mouthwash-1/merlin_178846320_22b060f7-2f69-4bbd-b297-08ffafbd3eb1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Scientists say that since the study didn&#8217;t recruit any human volunteers to gargle the products in question, the findings have limited value for the real world.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Kristoffer Tripplaar/Alamy</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/mouthwashes-could-inactivate-human-coronaviruses-that-cause-the-common-cold-232959144.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rash</a> of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/human-coronaviruses-inactivated-mouthwash-oral-rinses-study" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provocative</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.psu.edu/story/635101/2020/10/19/research/mouthwashes-oral-rinses-may-inactivate-human-coronaviruses" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">headlines</a> this week flooded social media platforms with a tantalizing idea: that mouthwash can &#8220;inactivate&#8221; coronaviruses and help curb their spread.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The idea came from a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26514" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study</a> that found that a coronavirus that causes common colds &#8212; not the one that causes Covid-19 &#8212; could be killed in a laboratory by dousing virus-infected cells with mouthwash. The study&#8217;s authors concluded that the products they tested &#8220;may provide an additional level of protection against&#8221; the new coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But outside experts <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/health/covid-mouthwash.html" title="">warned against overinterpreting the study&#8217;s results</a>, which might not have practical relevance to the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 220,000 Americans. Not only did the study not investigate this deadly new virus, but it also did not test whether mouthwash affects how viruses spread from person to person.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a problem with using Listerine,&#8221; said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not an antiviral.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The study, which was published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology, looked only at a coronavirus called 229E, which causes common colds &#8212; not the new coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The researchers flooded 229E coronaviruses grown in human liver cells in the lab with several types of mouthwash and nasal rinses for 30 seconds, one minute or two minutes &#8212; longer than the typical swig or spritz into a nose or mouth. Around 90 to 99 percent of the viruses could no longer infect cells after this exposure, the study found.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But because the study didn&#8217;t recruit any human volunteers to gargle the products in question, the findings have limited value for the real world, other experts said. The human mouth, full of nooks and crannies and a slurry of chemicals secreted by a diverse cadre of cells, is far more complicated than the inside of a laboratory dish.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Researchers warn people not to misuse mouthwash or nasal rinses or ingest large quantities of the liquids, because they can be dangerous.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-j--wu" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>

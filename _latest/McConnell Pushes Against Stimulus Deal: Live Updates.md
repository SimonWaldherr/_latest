It underscored the divisions within the party that have long hampered a compromise.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi had said earlier on Tuesday that she was &#8220;optimistic&#8221; a deal could be reached with the Trump administration in the coming days. But Republicans are growing increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump and his team are too eager to reach a multitrillion-dollar agreement and are conceding far too much to the Democrats. Republicans fear that scenario would force their colleagues up for re-election into a difficult choice of defying the president or alienating their fiscally conservative base by embracing the big-spending bill he has demanded.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Republicans in the Senate were also concerned that any vote on such a package could interfere with the Senate&#8217;s hasty timetable for confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court by early next week. Mr. McConnell said he told the White House he was particularly concerned a deal before then could inject unwanted unpredictability into the schedule, according to the Republicans, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a closed party luncheon.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell made it clear that he knew his counsel was likely to leak out, making reference to the possibility that his remarks could appear in the news media, two of the Republicans said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A short time later, outside the hearing room where Republicans met privately, Mr. McConnell told reporters the Senate would consider a broad bipartisan stimulus deal if the White House and Democrats struck one. But he would not say if it would hold a vote before Election Day, and members of his leadership team have warned that Republican votes could be hard to come by in the chamber.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If a presidentially supported bill clears the House, at some point we&#8217;ll bring it to the floor,&#8221; he said, without elaborating on the timetable.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, were scheduled to discuss the matter at 3 p.m. Tuesday. &#8220;Hopefully, by the end of the day today, we&#8217;ll know where we all are,&#8221; the speaker said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Sunday, Ms. Pelosi said that to pass a bill before the election, a deal would have to be reached within 48 hours. But in the interview on Tuesday, she softened that time limit, saying instead that legislation would have to be finished by the end of next week for aid to begin flowing by Nov. 3.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that this day was the day that we have a deal,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi said. &#8220;It was a day that we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell planned a test vote later Tuesday on a narrow measure that would revive the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular small-business loan program. While Democrats support the program, they are expected to oppose the narrow bill, contending that a far broader package is needed.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Nicholas Fandos</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="stocks-climb-in-turbulent-day-as-stimulus-talks-continue"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#stocks-climb-in-turbulent-day-as-stimulus-talks-continue">Stocks climb in turbulent day as stimulus talks continue.</a></h2><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Stocks on Wall Street rose on Tuesday, though trading was turbulent as investors reacted to developments between Democrats and Republicans over a new economic stimulus package.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">After rising nearly 1.5 percent the S&amp;P 500 gave back much of those gains late in the afternoon to end about half a percent higher. Speaker Nancy Pelosi had set Tuesday as a deadline for reaching an agreement on a package, but earlier in the day she suggested that she might be willing to extend that timeline.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Investors have watched the on-again, off-again talks closely in recent weeks, holding out hope for government spending that would support jobless Americans, small businesses, industries that have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, and state and local governments.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Stocks had received an early afternoon lift, following Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s appearance on Bloomberg Television, during which she sounded optimistic notes on the possibility of striking a deal on additional stimulus before the election.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">But it was later reported that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, advised the White House not to strike a deal before Election Day.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">The odds remained long that Democrats and the Trump administration could enact a plan before the Nov. 3 election. If differences over funding levels and policy issues could be resolved, there are still Senate Republicans to contend with, who are unlikely to approve a spending package as large as the one under discussion.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Shares of the big tech companies rose even as the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/business/us-economy-coronavirus/the-justice-department-filed-its-long-awaited-lawsuit-against-google" title="">Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit</a> against Google, accusing the company of maintaining an illegal monopoly over search and search advertising.

By using contracts to maintain its monopoly, the suit says, competition and innovation has suffered.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Google responded by describing the lawsuit as &#8220;deeply flawed.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This lawsuit would do nothing to help consumers,&#8221; the company <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement on its website. </a>&#8220;To the contrary, it would artificially prop up lower-quality search alternatives, raise phone prices, and make it harder for people to get the search services they want to use.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Attorney General William P. Barr, who was appointed by President Trump, has played an unusually active role in the investigation. He pushed career Justice Department attorneys to bring the case by the end of September, prompting pushback from lawyers who wanted more time and complained of political influence. Mr. Barr has spoken publicly about the inquiry for months and set tight deadlines for the prosecutors leading the effort.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The lawsuit may stretch on for years and could <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html" title="">set off a cascade of other antitrust lawsuits</a> from state attorneys general. About four dozen states and jurisdictions have conducted parallel investigations and are expected to bring separate complaints against the company&#8217;s grip on technology for online advertising.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A victory for the government could remake one of America&#8217;s most recognizable companies and the internet economy that it has helped define since it was founded by two Stanford University graduate students in 1998.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Google has long denied accusations of antitrust violations and is expected to fight the government&#8217;s efforts by using a global network of lawyers, economists and lobbyists. Alphabet, valued at $1.04 trillion and with cash reserves of $120 billion, has fought similar antitrust lawsuits in Europe.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-mccabe" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">David McCabe</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cecilia-kang" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Cecilia Kang</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/daisuke-wakabayashi" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="states-google-antitrust-suits"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#states-google-antitrust-suits">Seven states are considering filing their own antitrust suit against Google.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, said that if the seven states file a case, they would move to consolidate it with the Department of Justice&#8217;s." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/business/20Markets-brf-googleAG/merlin_177792702_d21b33f8-af75-41cd-9a1d-37a956451191-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, said that if the seven states file a case, they would move to consolidate it with the Department of Justice&#8217;s.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Kathy Willens/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Seven states may soon file a separate antitrust lawsuit against Google, the New York attorney general, Letitia James, announced on Tuesday.

While some analysts had predicted that Snap&#8217;s growth would tail off as people returned to school, its number of daily active users rose 18 percent to 249 million.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the company posted a net loss of nearly $200 million in the quarter, narrower than the loss of $227 million a year ago. The company&#8217;s stock jumped on the news.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic have continued, Snap has focused on introducing more shopping experiences in augmented reality, allowing people to try on clothes using filters in the app.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Our focus on delivering value for our community and advertising partners is yielding positive results during this challenging time,&#8221; Evan Spiegel, Snap's chief executive, said in a statement. &#8220;The adoption of augmented reality is happening faster than we had previously anticipated, and we are working together as a team to execute on the many opportunities in front of us.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-conger" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="heres-what-the-justice-department-had-to-say-about-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#heres-what-the-justice-department-had-to-say-about-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google">Here&#8217;s what the Justice Department had to say about its antitrust lawsuit against Google.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Deputy U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey A.

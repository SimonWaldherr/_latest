  Why some people are cruel to others 
description: > 
  Why are some humans cruel to people who don’t pose a threat to them – sometimes even their own children?Humans are the glory and the scum of the universe, concluded the French philosopher, Blaise Pascal, in 1658.But when someone harms the harmless, we ask: “How could you?”Humans typically do things to get pleasure or avoid pain.This suggests two reasons people may harm the harmless – either they don’t feel the others’ pain or they enjoy feeling the others’ pain.In the 21st Century, can we still conceive of being cruel to be kind?

<p>Why are some humans cruel to people who don&#8217;t pose a threat to them &#8211; sometimes even their own children? Where does this behaviour come from and what purpose does it serve? &#8211; Ruth, 45, London.</p>
<p>Humans are the glory and the scum of the universe, concluded the French philosopher,&#160;Blaise Pascal, in 1658. Little has changed. We love and we loathe. We help and we harm. We reach out a hand and we stick in the knife.</p>
<p>We understand if someone lashes out in retaliation or self-defence. But when someone harms the harmless, we ask: &#8220;How could you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Humans typically do things to get pleasure or avoid pain. For most of us, hurting others causes us to feel their pain. And we don&#8217;t like this feeling. This suggests two reasons people may harm the harmless &#8211; either they&#160;don&#8217;t&#160;feel the others&#8217; pain or they&#160;enjoy&#160;feeling the others&#8217; pain.</p>
<p>Another reason people harm the harmless is because they nonetheless see a threat. Someone who doesn&#8217;t imperil your body or wallet can still threaten your social status. This helps explain otherwise puzzling actions, such as when people harm others who help them financially.</p>
<p>Liberal societies assume causing others to suffer&#160;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jnietstud.48.3.0402">means we have harmed them</a>. Yet some philosophers&#160;<a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/179/179417/on-the-genealogy-of-morals/9780141195377.html">reject this idea</a>. In the 21st Century, can we still conceive of being cruel to be kind?</p>
<p><strong>Sadists and psychopaths</strong></p>
<p>Someone who gets pleasure from hurting or humiliating others is a sadist. Sadists&#160;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1107454">feel other people&#8217;s pain more</a>&#160;than is normal. And&#160;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1107454">they enjoy it</a>. At least, they do until it is over, when they may&#160;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167218816327">feel bad</a>.</p>
<p>The popular imagination associates sadism with torturers and murderers. Yet there is also the less extreme, but more widespread, phenomenon of&#160;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797613490749">everyday sadism</a>.</p></div>

  Protect the elderly with a £46k social care cap, say MPs 
description: > 
  A £46,000 cap on social care costs and an immediate £7billion injection of cash are needed to address a funding crisis, say MPs.The social care system is under close scrutiny after many care home residents died during the coronavirus pandemic, and the tragedy could deter many elderly people from using them in future.More than 17,000 pensioners were forced to sell homes to pay for social care last year, research by Money Mail recently revealed.The committee says a £46,000 cap on people's social care costs cap would cost around £3.1billion by 2023–24.The Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson says: 'We recognise the challenges facing social care and we are doing everything we can to support the sector during the pandemic including through regular testing of staff and residents, free PPE and over £1.1 billion through the Infection Control Fund.

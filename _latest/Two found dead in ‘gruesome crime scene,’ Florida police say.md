  Two found dead in ‘gruesome crime scene,’ Florida police say 
description: > 
  “This is probably the most gruesome crime scene I’ve ever worked – the worst in 37 years that I’ve ever seen,” the detective said.“It’s going to be really hard to put together what occurred, what the chronological events were that led up to the actual deaths.Going through the crime scene and photos, I’ll try to put something together, but it’s going to be speculation because there’s no witnesses and nobody saw anything.”

The Government has stated that, by 2035, no petrol- or diesel-engined cars – or even hybrids – will be allowed to be sold brand new in the UK. In early July the Prime Minister had been expected to boost the UK’s moribund automotive industry by announcing a new scrappage scheme to promote uptake of electric cars but that has yet to pass

In other words, in 15 years’ time, the UK’s new car sales market will probably be almost entirely electric. That means manufacturers have until then to get a range of electric models on sale and available to us to replace the vast array of petrol, diesel and hybrid cars currently on offer.

No small feat, frankly. And of course, an electric car won’t suit everyone; finding a solution that works for those whose annual mileage is too great, or who simply don’t have access to an electric car charger at home or nearby, will be imperative in the intervening years.

But if you can make the switch, electric cars offer plenty of benefits, even now. Not only are modern electric cars fast and quiet, but they’re also cheap to run and maintain and mechanically very simple.

And such is the pace of development that, with a couple of exceptions, this top 10 bears little relation to our pick of EVs on a couple of months ago.

Besides, switching to electric before we’re forced to could help you to get your head around the ins and outs of charging, as well as to work out whether range anxiety really will affect you. Fancy it? If so, we reckon these are the best EVs on sale today.

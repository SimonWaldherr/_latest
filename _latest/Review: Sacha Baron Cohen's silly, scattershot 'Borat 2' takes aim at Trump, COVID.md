  Review: Sacha Baron Cohen's silly, scattershot 'Borat 2' takes aim at Trump, COVID 
description: > 
  At least Cohen is aiming really high this time, right at folks who work in the White House.The sentence ends when he gets a new order from the Kazakhstan president, who wants to snuggle up to “McDonald” Trump.There is an intriguing meta aspect to “Subsequent Moviefilm”: People recognize Cohen-as-Borat and it’s hilarious seeing random folks yelling, “High five!” at him or him finding a “Stupid Foreign Reporter” costume at a Halloween store.It’s easy to wonder when watching Cohen, who garnered an Oscar screenplay nomination for the original “Borat,” what’s real and what’s not.Directed by Jason Woliner, "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” features an unexpectedly strong ending that at least pays off some of the sweeter aspects of the family dynamic, plus wraps up on an activist note (“Now vote or you will be execute”).

At least Cohen is aiming really high this time, right at folks who work in the White House.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">A new &#8216;Borat&#8217;:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/09/30/borat-sequel-released-amazon-before-election/3584898001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Sacha Baron Cohen's sequel to be released by Amazon before election</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Sacha Baron Cohen:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/06/28/sacha-baron-cohen-may-have-crashed-conservative-rally-racist-song/3274969001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">'Borat' star pranks a conservative rally with a racist singalong</a></p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt='Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) goes undercover as "Country Steve" when crashing a March for Our Rights rally in "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm."'><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">His high-profile targets reflect Borat's important new assignment.&#160;After his&#160;2006 mission to make a documentary about America turned his homeland&#160;into a global laughingstock, Borat&#160;was sentenced to a gulag. The sentence ends when he gets a new order from the Kazakhstan president, who wants to snuggle up to &#8220;McDonald&#8221; Trump.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">To earn Trump's respect, Borat is sent back to America to deliver a monkey (who's somehow the country's&#160;ministry of culture and also a porno star) to someone in&#160;Trump&#8217;s inner circle: Vice President Mike Pence. &#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-movies-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After Borat takes a boat to Galveston, Texas, he learns something bad happened to the monkey but&#160;discovers&#160;his daughter has stowed away, so he decides to gift Tatur to Pence.

COVID-19 plays a key role as well: Pence&#8217;s speech mentions the golden age of only having 15 cases of coronavirus, and Borat ends up quarantining with some Trump supporters.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-movies-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It&#8217;s easy to wonder when watching Cohen, who garnered an Oscar screenplay nomination for the original &#8220;Borat,&#8221; what&#8217;s real and what&#8217;s not. Cohen probably didn&#8217;t really go into lockdown with guys who insist Hillary Clinton drinks the blood of children (&#8220;It&#8217;s been said,&#8221; one of them says), especially with cameras running. (Honestly, after one of these movies you just want to know how they pulled off the entire thing.) Thanks to Google, however, we know of some actual incidents that occur in the movie, including Cohen (as Borat as &#8220;Country Steve&#8221;) crashing a March for Our Rights rally and getting portions of the conservative crowd whooping by singing offensive lyrics about Barack Obama, Anthony Fauci and others.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) dresses up as Donald Trump and interrupts Mike Pence's CPAC speech in &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.&quot;"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cohen has a clear focus for his crassness, deploying his satirical weaponry&#160;on red-state conspiracy theories and showing Trump supporters wielding machine guns, Confederate flags and Nazi salutes. (There&#8217;s also a running joke with the Trumps depicted as an animated Disney-esque king and queen, and one scene takes a jab at the president's, um, manhood.) Some of the partisan duping is rather ingenious, including one sequence where Tutar eats a plastic baby on a cupcake and to get it out of her stomach, she and her dad go to a pregnancy center and confuse a pro-life pastor.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Directed by Jason Woliner, "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&#8221; features an unexpectedly strong ending that at least pays off some of the sweeter aspects of the&#160;family dynamic, plus&#160;wraps up on an activist note (&#8220;Now vote or you will be execute&#8221;). And while Cohen can be a great &#8220;serious&#8221; actor when he wants (see: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/09/25/netflix-the-trial-chicago-7-review-aaron-sorkin-stellar-cast/3510171001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">&#8220;The Trial of the Chicago 7&#8221;</a>), the absolute commitment to the over-the-top Borat persona continues to be admirable.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If the mankini still fits, wear it.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/entertainment/movies/2020/07/07/ranked-best-movies-2020-so-far/5386005002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

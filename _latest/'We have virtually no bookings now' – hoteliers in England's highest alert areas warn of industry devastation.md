In his address to the Commons today, the Prime Minister set out plans for a new three-tier system (medium, high, very high) that works hand-in-hand with the NHS Test and Trace App, alerting users about locally placed lockdowns based on infection rates in the area (which will determine the tier).

Liverpool was the first to be placed on a "very high" alert level from Wednesday, with pubs and bars to close, followed by Nottingham on "high". The Prime Minister is expected to address the nation with more details on new restrictions at 7pm tonight.

Hoteliers who are constantly adjusting to new measures – such as curfews and the rule of six – are concerned that empty cities mean empty rooms, restaurants and bars, forcing them to shut; that jobs hanging by a thread will no longer be saved; and the knock-on effect for suppliers will be irreversible.

In Liverpool, Dave Brewitt, the owner of Hope Street Hotel, said the news on regional, blanket lockdowns presents an "extremely difficult and serious situation".

He said that with so many livelihoods at stake, three-tier restrictions are "hugely worrying" and damaging for the hospitality sector, and it is "vital that businesses are allowed – and helped – to survive" as the country battles to support essential services.

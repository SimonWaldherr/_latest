Khloé Kardashian revealed she was once employed as The Simple Life alum Nicole Richie's assistant briefly before her own E! series Keeping Up with the Kardashians premiered in 2007.

'I went to school with her,' the 36-year-old Good American co-founder said on Monday's episode of Emergency Contact podcast.

'She was one of my best friends growing up and we were just really, really close and then when she started doing Simple Life - I think it was after Simple Life - she just needed some help and I just needed a job.'

Poking fun of their respective plastic surgery, Khloé said to her best friend Malika Haqq: 'I was Nicole Richie's assistant and you were Jonathan Cheban's assistant and we met five faces ago.'

Kardashian's big sister Kim Kardashian West also has a direct connection to The Simple Life having worked as Paris Hilton's stylist/closet organizer in the early 2000s.

Paris and Nicole famously pranked their way through their irreverent fish-out-of-water reality show, which aired from 2003-2007 on E! and Fox.

The Calabasas socialite and the 37-year-old Sky High alum originally met at age 15 when Malika started dating Khloé's guy friend around 1999.

Khloé continued: 'Then when she started doing Simple Life - I think it was after Simple Life - she just needed some help and I just needed a job' (pictured in 2011)

'Malika and I are really good at knowing, like, okay we might hang out with a borrowed friend, but they're not like your ride or dies,' Kardashian explained.

'You have to know who you're doing a feature with and who you're doing a f***ing duet with. And Malika and I are doing a f***ing album.'

Haqq frequently calls the Revenge Body host for advice with raising her seven-month-old son Ace Flores from her two-year romance with babydaddy O.T. Genasis, whom she split from in June 2019.

And Khloé mothers two-year-old daughter True from her relationship with Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson, which ended in February 2019 following his three cheating scandals.

'I'm always on her line,' the former DASH sales clerk said.

'It's a lot of coaching, but I think us having babies together, which is something I always pictured, is amazing because our kids love each other.'

Kardashian added: 'And we get to have mommy wine nights!'

The half-Armenian beauty admitted she was 'devastated' that KUWTK is finally ending next year after 14 years and 20 seasons.

'It's hard because I'm not good with change, but that doesn't mean I don't need a break,' Khloé told hosts Simon Huck and Melissa Gray Washington.

'I'm also sometimes afraid to take the break. I know it's good. It hits me in waves - like today, I've been nauseous all day and I know I have anxiety.'

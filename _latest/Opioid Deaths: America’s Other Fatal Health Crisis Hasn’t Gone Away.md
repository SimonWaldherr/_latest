The U.S. coronavirus death toll surpassed 213,000 recently, and while several pharmaceutical companies are working swiftly to develop a vaccine, none is available yet.

Now in the shadow of COVID-19, opioid misuse is another long-term health crisis that has killed over 450,000 people in this country since 1999, and it continues to rage. Unlike with COVID-19, there are interventions available for opioid use disorder – but for too many, they simply are not available.

The problem is everywhere. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 115,000 deaths around the globe in 2017 were attributable to opioid drug use. In 2018, opioids killed almost 50,000 Americans – more than the number killed by firearms .

Compounding the problem is that illicitly manufactured fentanyl has become ubiquitous in drug markets, so non-opioid users are dying as fentanyl is mixed with other drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine.

Final data is likely to show that fatal overdoses have increased dramatical ly in many communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Cook County, Illinois , for example, opioid overdose fatalities were up 28% from January to mid-July compared with the same time last year, from 605 to 773 deaths.

In Maryland , drug and alcohol deaths were up 9.1 percent from January to June, with opioids tied to nearly all of the more than 1,300 deaths. Overall, more than 40 states have reported increases in opioid-related deaths in recent months, according to a brief from the American Medical Association.

There are several reasons for these jumps, including increased depression and anxiety tied to the pandemic, disruptions in drug supply, the end of in-person, face-to-face prevention and treatment services due to COVID-19 precautions and unplanned stops and starts in drug usage and isolation.

Since 2017, I have led the Statewide Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) in Illinois. Our team collects in-depth data on opioid overdoses that occur in 43 Illinois counties – around 2,200 fatal cases per year. Each week, I read tens of case reports on opioid-involved fatalities.

These cases are all unique in the despair they reflect, but they also share features that suggest they could have been prevented. A typical case involves someone who has struggled with substance abuse for an extended period of time. Then there is a shocking discovery by a loved one – often in a home they share – who will later recall secretive behavior, being unaware of what the victim was going through and a sense of missed opportunity.

Many may think that overdoses typically only claim the young or people on a wild path of self-destruction. But more often than not, the cases I read are of middle-aged parents with grown children, people who are married, people who have young children – even grandparents.

At first, I thought what many people think: "It's a shame, but they did this to themselves." Then I learned about addiction and studied the lives people led. They are people injured at work who became addicted to opioids, eventually losing their jobs, homes and family. They're adults who became addicted after being prescribed painkillers for injuries sustained in a car accident as a teen.

They are women with health conditions – perhaps they had a knee replacement, heart problems or joint pain – who became addicted in midlife. They are professionals who'd been to rehab and back more times than their loved ones could count. They are people living in daily, grinding physical and psychological pain.

To be sure, substance misuse overall is a pervasive problem in the U.S. More than 20 million Americans suffer from substance addiction . This is a problem of such magnitude that it requires research focused on root causes to better understand and prevent addiction from developing in the first place.

Still, for those trapped in opioid misuse, an array of effective interventions are available – yet people are still dying.

That's because although there are effective policies and programs to help lessen the danger for those who misuse opioids and other drugs, they are not available to all those in need. For example, medication-assisted treatment is the only evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, but not all have access to it. MAT combines medication counseling and behavioral therapy to treat addiction. While it improves patient survival, treatment retention and employment outcomes, it decreases illicit drug use and criminal activity.

One element contributing to the shortage of MAT is ideological opposition among some providers. Another element is the availability of detox beds, as in order to start MAT, a patient must be in withdrawal. Finally, though MAT is covered by Medicaid and most private insurance. funding is needed to provide it to the uninsured.

Safe consumption sites – medically supervised facilities in which those who misuse opioids and illicit drugs can use in safety – are another tool that can help curb opioid overdose deaths. A safe consumption site in Vancouver, British Columbia, that opened in 2003 reportedly has supervised more than 3.6 million injections and responded to some 6,000 overdoses. Not one person has died of an overdose while utilizing the site.

Multiple U.S. locations – including Denver, Illinois and Philadelphia – have explored opening safe consumption sites. Yet such efforts have run into hurdles such as law enforcement and community opposition . It may well be years before legal safe consumption sites are operational in the U.S.

As a leader of an overdose public health surveillance system, I have worked to leverage data to create a distribution model for the overdose-reversing drug naloxone that has strong lifesaving potential. "Block by Block" is a partnership-based distribution model in which communities with the highest fatal overdose burden are identified using data from SUDORS.

Our team collaborates with a local community organization to identify resources including outreach workers, naloxone suppliers, trainers and others. Next, neighbors, business owners, religious institutions and others on those blocks are recruited to undergo naloxone administration training.

We hold several full-length training sessions as well as abbreviated trainings. Sessions cover how to recognize an overdose, how to administer naloxone, how to deal with a person after reversal and how to provide information on local treatment resources.

After completing the training, participants receive naloxone administration kits and signs to put in their window or on their lawn to alert others that a trained naloxone administrator is on site. They also receive handouts to share on treatment services in the community, as well as a list of resources where they can refill their naloxone supply.

This approach allows burdened communities to develop local resources that can help curb the epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Yet it's just one of many tools that we must not lose sight of during the COVID-19 pandemic.

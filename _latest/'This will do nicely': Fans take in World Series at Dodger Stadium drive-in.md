  'This will do nicely': Fans take in World Series at Dodger Stadium drive-in 
description: > 
  LOS ANGELES — The sound of honking horns blasted through the air outside Dodger Stadium on Tuesday night.While the Los Angeles Dodgers were in Texas and on their way to an 8-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 1 of the World Series, more than 2,000 of their fans celebrated in unique fashion.About 850 cars were parked in two lots next to empty Dodger Stadium as fans watched the Fox telecast on 60-foot tall screens in what was billed as a “Dodgers postseason drive-in.’’Game 1 of the World Series would have been played at Dodger Stadium if not for the coronavirus pandemic, which led Major League Baseball to hold the World Series at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.Goodrich said she’s planning to come back for more World Series drive-ins.Like I wish my grandparents had been around just to see what they thought of it.

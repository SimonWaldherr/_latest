  Incredible photos reveal the moment NASA's OSIRIS-Rex made historic touchdown on asteroid Bennu 
description: > 
  AdvertisementStunning images taken from the historic OSIRIS-REx mission show the moment the spacecraft touched down on the asteroid Bennu more than 200 million miles away from Earth to collect a sample of dirt and dust Tuesday night.Stunning images taken from the historic OSIRIS-REx mission show the moment the spacecraft touched down on the asteroid Bennu more than 200 million miles away from Earth to collect a sample of dirt and dust Tuesday night.The van-sized OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft is in 'good health' after the Tuesday mission, NASA said.NASA's OSIRIS-Rex mission will land on Bennu on October 20 to collect samples of the space rock.Japan expects samples from its second asteroid mission — in the milligrams at most — to land in the Australian desert in December.

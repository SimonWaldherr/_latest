<div><p>Lockdown enthusiasts often cite China as an example of why it is first necessary to tame the virus before you can expect any lasting economic rebound. Economic success depends on success in first eradicating the virus, they argue.</p>
<p>Yet in truth, even China doesn&#8217;t entirely support this case. The initial stages of China&#8217;s rebound were <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/13/car-sales-boom-china-economic-recovery-continues/">almost wholly production-led in an economy</a> already highly reliant on production to support output.</p>
<p>It is only comparatively recently that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/19/chinas-economy-accelerates-ahead-rest-race-recovery/">consumption has started to come back</a>, and even now it accounts for a much smaller proportion of growth than has been typical in recent years.</p>
<p>It follows that the rebound in production had little to do with recovering domestic, household demand, but was almost entirely down to official stimulus and to exports.</p>
<p>Ironically, the latter have been booming, particularly in the case of Covid-related items such as PPE and medical equipment. I say ironically because Donald Trump&#8217;s trade war with China was meant to stem the tide of Chinese imports, yet Covid has made Western consumers <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/19/government-bought-ppe-firms-linked-chinese-state/">even more reliant on Chinese factories than before</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike in the West, where government stimulus has been substantially focused on income support, in China it was almost wholly directed towards investment, for which there is no obvious demand, further increasing the pre-existing imbalance between production and consumption.</p>
<p>As George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University&#8217;s China Centre, puts it:&#160;&#8220;The consumption side of the economy is still subdued, not just because of residual fear of the virus, but primarily because stimulus has not been supporting incomes. The gap between what they are producing and what they are consuming has further widened.&#8221;</p>

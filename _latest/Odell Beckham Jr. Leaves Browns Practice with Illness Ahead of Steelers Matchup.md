Cleveland Browns receiver Odell Beckham Jr. left practice Thursday with an undisclosed illness, head coach Kevin Stefanski told reporters.

The coach clarified that Beckham hasn't tested positive for COVID-19.

Cleveland plays the 4-0 Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.

Beckham appeared in all 16 games last season but was limited for much of the year by a core muscle injury. He underwent surgery to repair the problem in January.

Staying healthy continues to be an issue for the 27-year-old, who missed 16 games combined in 2017 and 2018 with the New York Giants because of a variety of issues. Last year was only his second 16-game season in six years in the NFL.

The 2019 season was also a disappointment on the field, whether it was due to injuries or a lack of chemistry with quarterback Baker Mayfield.

During his first season with Cleveland, Beckham finished with 74 catches for 1,035 yards and four touchdowns. Though it was his fifth 1,000-yard season, he posted the lowest catches-per-game and yards-per-game averages of his career.

He has been up and down in 2020 as well, totaling 21 receptions for 294 yards and three touchdowns.

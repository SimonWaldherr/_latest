<p>The country's system ranked 15th globally, below a swathe of European countries according to the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index.</p>
<p>This measures&#160;state funded and private components of 39 countries&#8217; pension systems based on how secure and sustainable they were&#160;and whether they provided&#160;enough for people to live on.</p>
<p>The best place in the world to retire was the Netherlands, followed by Denmark. Nordic countries such as Finland, Norway and Sweden also boasted&#160;better retirements than Britain, as did Israel, Singapore and Canada.</p>
<p>Britain scored 64.9 points in pension consultancy Mercer&#8217;s Pension Index, up from 64.4 in 2019 due to a slight <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/22/uk-pensioners-get-worse-deal-chile-colombia/">improvement </a>on its "sustainability". It scored highly on &#8220;integrity&#8221; as Mercer said there savers could trust&#160;the system&#160;to deliver what it is supposed to.</p>
<p>However, Benoit Hudon of Mercer said there was too much focus&#160;on security at the expense of providing adequate retirement income and ensuring the cost to both savers and taxpayers was sustainable.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;There are numerous levers the Government could pull to improve the system, though first a fundamental debate is needed to agree the optimal balance between security, adequacy and affordability."</p>

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Charissa Frangione, 34, a small-business owner and City Council member in Marcus, Iowa, voted for Mr. Trump four years ago but said she had soured on him since then. In 2016, &#8220;I just thought, who better to get the economy back in order than a businessman?&#8221; she said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Unfortunately, I just don&#8217;t feel like he&#8217;s lived up to my expectations as a president,&#8221; Ms. Frangione said. &#8220;Even the good things he does are washed out by his demeanor.&#8221; She has already voted by mail for Mr. Biden.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Unlike Hillary Clinton, who was as unpopular as Mr. Trump in surveys leading up to the 2016 election, Mr. Biden is not as polarizing a figure as the president: Fewer than half of the poll&#8217;s respondents viewed him unfavorably. And while 47 percent of independent voters had a very unfavorable view of Mr. Trump, just 27 percent of independents felt the same animus toward Mr. Biden.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">While Mr. Biden may not ultimately need Iowa&#8217;s six electoral votes to claim the presidency, the state could prove more pivotal in the battle for the Senate. Should Mr. Biden be elected, Democrats would need to gain three seats to win control of the chamber. And few Senate races appear as closely contested as the one in Iowa, where outside groups are saturating the state&#8217;s airwaves on behalf of both candidates.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Ms. Ernst was one of the breakout winners of the 2014 midterm elections, memorably airing an ad recalling her youthful days castrating hogs and promising to cut the pork in Washington. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/us/politics/joni-ernst-iowa-republican-senate.html" title="">But she has proved vulnerable this year.</a></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">She is plainly suffering from Mr. Trump&#8217;s divisiveness, as made clear by her deficits among women and college-educated white voters, but she does not enjoy the president&#8217;s intensity of support from Iowa Republicans. While 73 percent of them have a very favorable view of Mr. Trump, only 57 percent feel the same way about Ms. Ernst.</p></div>

  European Super League threat may lead to revised Project Big Picture, fear top-flight club chiefs 
description: > 
  Premier League chiefs are convinced Manchester United and Liverpool will use the threat of a breakaway European league as leverage to agree a revised version of Project Big Picture.And it is understood Premier League bosses fear United and Liverpool will use the notion of a new European league - and their potential involvement in it - as a pawn in the forthcoming top-flight strategy review.There is a general acknowledgement the Premier League would lose much of its appeal without a full strength United and Liverpool - who are historically recognised as two of the biggest clubs on the planet.The Premier League confirmed last week that the controversial Project Big Picture proposals - that were led by United and Liverpool - had been unanimously rejected by the Football Association and themselves.'The Premier League just in itself is the most-watched league, most-entertaining league in the world at the moment and everybody's a little bit envious of the plaudits it gets and the viewing figures it gets.

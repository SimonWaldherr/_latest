  My month in the garden: Meet the family behind Thyme, Cotswolds, and tips for sowing cauliflower 
description: > 
  I started working with Caryn Hibbert, founder of Thyme at Southrop, Gloucestershire, back in 2008.I helped Caryn with the design of her own garden and then the cookery school garden.Having acquired a stunning Cotswold manor house and a range of barns and outbuildings, Caryn decided to develop them into a “village within a village”.The ethos of the Ox Barn restaurant in the 19th-century former oxen house is local food using that day’s ingredients.Head chef Charlie Hibbert, Caryn’s son, helpfully tips me off to great veg varieties that he is using.

<div><p>I started working with Caryn Hibbert, founder of <a href="http://thyme.co.uk">Thyme </a>at Southrop, Gloucestershire, back in 2008. I helped Caryn with the design of her own garden and then the cookery school garden. I quickly realised Caryn was no ordinary person.</p>
<p>Previously she had worked as an obstetrician and gynaecologist then, with three children under three, she moved into philanthropic work and helped to raise funds to build a children&#8217;s&#8217; hospices. Her next move was to Southrop, where her creativity began to bloom.</p>
<p>Having acquired a stunning Cotswold manor house and a range of barns and outbuildings, Caryn decided to develop them into a &#8220;village within a village&#8221;. Creating this unique place, more lifestyle than hotel, has been her passion and focus for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>The beautifully converted buildings sit within 150 acres of farmland, including beautiful water meadows, acres of grazing Welsh black mountain sheep, bees, an extensive orchard and a large kitchen garden.</p>
<p>The ethos of the <a href="https://www.thyme.co.uk/ox-barn">Ox Barn restaurant</a> in the 19th-century former oxen house is local food using that day&#8217;s ingredients. Head chef Charlie Hibbert, Caryn&#8217;s son, helpfully tips me off to great veg varieties that he is using. Camilla, Caryn&#8217;s daughter, is helping to develop the retail and marketing.</p>

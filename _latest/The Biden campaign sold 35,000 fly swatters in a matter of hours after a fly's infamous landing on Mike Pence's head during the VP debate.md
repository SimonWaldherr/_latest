The Biden campaign sold 35,000 fly swatters within hours this week, after moving swiftly to capitalize on one of the most bizarre moments of the vice presidential debate, Bloomberg reported.

The swatters, which sold for $10 each, carried the slogan "Truth Over Flies" in a play on the Biden campaign's slogan, "Truth Over Lies."

The swatters' slogan was a reference to a fly that landed on Vice President Mike Pence's head for two minutes during the debate on Wednesday evening. The fly immediately became a social media sensation and was trending for hours after the debate.

Later that night, Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, tweeted a picture of himself holding a fly swatter that was originally posted on his Facebook page in October 2019.

Biden continues to maintain a lead in polls nationally just ahead of the November 3 election.

President Trump now finds himself trailing in several battleground states that helped him win the White House in 2016, including Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

(CNN) At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the nation witnessed firsthand the pressure and challenges that face our health care system when hospitals and health care providers deal with high patient volumes. At Northwell Health, we took care of far more patients outside the hospitals than inside the hospitals. Through all this we learned that Covid-19 patients required an unprecedented level of care.

But there is much more to this story.

The 2018-2019 flu season saw approximately 35.5 million influenza cases with over 490,000 hospitalizations. Our hope is that number will be far less for this flu season given the use of masks and social distancing. That said, as we enter the 2020-21 flu season, testing for influenza and Covid-19 will be critical, as it will not only help diagnose respiratory illnesses, but also determine the prevalence of influenza A, influenza B and Covid-19 in our communities. Through testing, we can better understand the need for home monitoring and the implementation of contact tracing.

A national primary care testing strategy should be implemented that will take into account the availability of testing materials and access to testing sites. Managing respiratory infections will be like planning a long rush hour commute in a mix of rain, ice, sleet and snow. We need to clear the roads and navigate as best we can to develop this testing strategy for symptomatic patients. Time is running out and we need to forge our path now.

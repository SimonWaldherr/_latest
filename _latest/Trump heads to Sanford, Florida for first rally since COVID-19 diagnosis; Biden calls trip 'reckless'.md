WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail Monday, traveling to northern Florida a week-and-a-half after testing positive for COVID-19 and facing a daunting new political environment.

Trump holds a rally at Orlando Sanford International Airport after a string of polls show him trailing Democrat Joe Biden both nationally and in key battleground states like Florida.

"Leaving now for Florida Rally," Trump tweeted shortly before boarding Air Force One (without a face mask). "Big crowds!"

The trip, which will be followed this week by rallies in Pennsylvania, Iowa, and North Carolina, also takes place amid continuing questions about the president's health.

In a statement released late Monday, presidential physician Sean Conley said Trump has tested negative for COVID-19 "on consecutive days" – he didn't say how many – and "the President is not infectious to others."

Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and several of her aides were among West Wing staff members who announced last week they had tested positive for the virus.

"Donald Trump is a walking public health risk," said Josh Schwerin of Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supports Democratic candidates.

"This trip is a reminder to voters that Trump doesn't care about their health, he doesn't care about getting the virus under control so we can fix the economy," Schwerin said. "He only cares about feeding his ego in front of his adoring hardcore supporters."

There are also lingering questions about how he contracted COVID-19 before he announced by tweet that he had tested positive shortly before 1 a.m. ET on Oct. 2.

Since then, Trump and his aides have refused to say when he last tested negative, leaving open the possibility he was already infected when he debated Biden on Sept. 29, hosted a rally in Duluth, Minn., the next night, and hosted financial donors at his New Jersey golf club the day after that.

Trump spent the weekend of Oct. 2-5 in Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, returning late that Monday in a nationally televised spectacle in which he pulled off his mask after ascending the steps of the North Portico. Trump has attributed his recovery to treatments that include an experimental antibody drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and dexamethasone, a steroid.

During a week of convalescence at the White House, Trump visited the Oval Office on occasion, taped video messages he tweeted out, and gave interviews to supportive talk show hosts.

The period of seclusion ended with a rally-like event Saturday at the White House in which Trump spoke from a balcony to an invited group of supporters gathered on the South Lawn.

In brief remarks, Trump launched familiar attacks on Biden and the Democrats and touted the economy. Trump, who often holds forth at rallies for more than 90 minutes, spoke for only 18 minutes at the event.

Aides would not predict how long the president might speak in Florida. They said he is well enough to handle a string of rallies scheduled throughout the week, including Johnstown, Pa., on Tuesday; Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday, and Greenville, N.C., on Thursday.

"He is strong," said campaign manager Bill Stepien, who returned to the office this week after testing positive for the virus himself. "He is energetic. He is raring to go."

Democrats questioned whether Trump should be out on the road so soon after getting sick.

Biden said Trump's trip to northern Florida "bringing nothing but reckless behavior, divisive rhetoric, and fear mongering," no plan to combat the pandemic and the economic damage it has wrought.

"Donald Trump won’t speak to the pain being felt by working families," Biden said.

Trump also returns to active campaigning in a diminished state electorally.

After the debate – one in which Trump took criticism for constantly interrupting Biden and declining to disavow white supremacy – the Democrat expanded his lead in a series of polls.

The Real Clear Politics average of recent national polls gives Biden a lead of slightly more than 10 percentage points. Biden also leads in key states like Florida (3.7%), Pennsylvania (7.1%), Michigan (7.0%), and Wisconsin (6.1%), according to website's average of state polls.

The race is also tight in normally Republican states like Georgia and Texas.

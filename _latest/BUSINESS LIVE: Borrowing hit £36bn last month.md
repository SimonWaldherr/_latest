description: > 
  The FTSE 100 closed down 2 per cent or 112.72 points at 5,776.50 and the pound rose by more than 1 per cent to hit $1.31 on Wednesday.Traders are growing more confident the UK and EU will strike a trade deal before the year is out.UK government borrowing topped £36.1billion in September as heavy spending continued to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.It is the third-highest borrowing in any month since records began in 1993.Bookmaker William Hill has warned that further local lockdowns triggered by a fast-spreading second coronavirus wave would hit core earnings, as it posted year-to-date revenues that were a third lower due to a drop in gaming revenue.

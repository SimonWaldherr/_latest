<div><p>Maria Taylor will not be intimidated by hateful messages, nor will it stop her from doing the job she loves.</p>
<p>On Monday, the ESPN reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/MariaTaylor/status/1318232657579397120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a lengthy message she received</a> in response to previous comments about Bills rookie quarterback Jake Fromm, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/04/bills-rookie-jake-fromm-apologizes-for-elite-white-people-text/">who said in a previous text exchange</a> that only &#8220;elite white people&#8221; should be able to access guns. The message said that Fromm&#8217;s comments were how &#8220;95% of all white athletes talk and feel&#8221; and called Taylor a &#8220;trash affirmative action hire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So to be clear texting my father, mother, and brother this hatred does NOT scare me and it will not keep me from doing my job,&#8221; Taylor tweeted. &#8220;See you this weekend in Minnesota College Football Fans&#8230;I missed you!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>In June, Taylor spoke about Fromm&#8217;s apology <a href="https://twitter.com/FirstTake/status/1268963173488570368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during an appearance on &#8220;First Take,&#8221;</a> stating: &#8220;Every time [prejudice] is revealed, and it&#8217;s someone say you love or you&#8217;ve enjoyed covering, it hurts to your core. It&#8217;s a death by 1,000 razor cuts. And that&#8217;s how I feel when I heard about Jake Fromm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor&#8217;s ESPN colleagues and Twitter followers rallied around her Monday, issuing statements of support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh, Maria, I&#8217;m so sorry. Keep kicking ass!!!&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahSpain/status/1318245430208188423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Spain tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they go low you just keep going back to work!&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/elleduncanESPN/status/1318238528573218818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle Duncan posted.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Keep doing your thing @MariaTaylor. You are killing it. This guy had to take a breather from slurping yogurt from a tube and picking boogers to send this trash,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/wyche89/status/1318254107698679809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Network&#8217;s Steve Wyche wrote</a>.</p>

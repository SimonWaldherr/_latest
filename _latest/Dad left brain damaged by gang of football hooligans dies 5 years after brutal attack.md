 <p>A further three men were convicted at the same trial for conspiracy to commit violent disorder and one other man was convicted of assisting an offender and admitted possessing a pepper spray.</p> <p>Since the trial however, ten of the men have been released from prison.</p> <p>Last year, wife Nicole launched a campaign to get a new law passed by government.</p> <p>The campaign asks for harsher punishments to be given to people who commit violent crimes like Simon's attackers.</p> <p>She also wants people convicted of violent disorder to have a percentage of their earnings through work or benefits taken from them and given to the NHS for the rest of their lives.</p> <p><a href="http://change.org/p/houses-of-parliament-simon-s-law" rel="nofollow">You can support the petition here for Simon's Law.</a></p></div>

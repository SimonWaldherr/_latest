Rodgers would've clearly had the edge in that scenario.</p><p class="">Thanks to its defense, Tampa Bay set the tempo Sunday.</p><p class="">When the Packers jumped out to an early 10-0 lead, Rodgers looked headed for another prolific outing.&#160;Then Jamel Dean intercepted a Rodgers pass and ran it back 32 yards for a touchdown. Green Bay's next possession ended in an interception, as well. Mike Edwards was two yards short of the end zone on that occasion.</p><p class="">This entire win was why the Buccaneers signed Brady.</p><p class="">They finished sixth in defensive efficiency in 2019, per <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/team-defense/2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Football Outsiders</a>.&#160;Bring in a quarterback less prone to interceptions than Jameis Winston to pair with an elite defense and a seven-win team could become a Super Bowl contender.</p><p class="">Speaking of Brady, it took six weeks, but he finally connected with Rob Gronkowski for a touchdown.</p><p class="">This was Tampa Bay's first real statement of the season and could prove to be the turning point at which things started clicking for Bruce Arians' squad.</p><p id="br-ad-89329696" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Packers Face Reality Check</strong></p><p class="">Conversely, the Packers might soon discover their 4-0 start isn't indicative of how the entire season will unfold.</p><p class="">Rodgers averaged 303.5 yards through four games, while Tampa Bay was giving up an average of&#160;239.8 yards through the air.&#160;The Bucs had also registered the fourth-most sacks (17).</p><p class="">Something had to give, and that something was Rodgers.</p><p class="">If the Packers are merely a very good offensive team instead of an elite one, then masking one of the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nfl">NFL</a>'s worst defenses becomes even more difficult.</p><p class="">The Buccaneers didn't put a ton of yards on the Packers, largely because they didn't need to before any drama about the outcome evaporated. Once Tampa Bay had the game firmly in control, playing safe and avoiding mistakes became the strategy.</p><p class="">Green Bay had a 29-point defeat to the San Francisco 49ers in Week 12 and proceeded to close the 2019 season on a five-game winning streak.</p><p class="">You don't want to judge a team too harshly based on its worst day. Having said that, fans will be right to question whether this is another year in which the Packers pile up wins before once again falling short of the Super Bowl.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>What's Next?</strong></p><p class="">The Packers stay on the road in Week 7, when they play the Houston Texans.&#160;The Buccaneers have a prime-time matchup with the Las Vegas Raiders on Oct. 25.</p></div>

President Trump went all-in on his law-and-order message Tuesday in Jonestown, Pennsylvania, for his second rally since he returned to the campaign trail after battling COVID-19. On Monday, Mr. Trump traveled to Sanford, Florida, for his first campaign rally since announcing he had tested positive for the virus.

The president made a hard pitch to women voters, who are heavily voting for former Vice President Joe Biden, according to all recent polling.

"Suburban women, will you please like me?" the president pleaded with the crowd. "I saved your damn neighborhood."

Mr. Trump has pitched himself as the savior of suburbia to his audiences, insisting Democrats will put low-income housing in the suburbs.

The president also joked Tuesday, as he did Monday, that he felt healthy enough to "kiss" the men and women in the audience.

"I could come down and start kissing everybody," he teased. "I'll kiss every guy. Man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I'll kiss him. Not with a lot of enjoyment but that's OK."

The president, who tested negative on consecutive days, according to his physician, appeared to be frustrated by coverage of his coronavirus journey.

"Totally Negative China Virus Reports. Hit it early and hard. Fake News is devastated. They are very bad (and sick!) people!" he tweeted.

Mr. Trump said he felt great Monday night.

"I went through it. Now they say I'm immune," the president said during his Monday rally. His doctor has said he is no longer infectious, and scientists have cautioned that there is little known about COVID-19 immunity since so much is still unknown about the virus. "I feel so powerful I'll walk into that audience. I'll walk in there, I'll kiss everyone in that audience. I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful woman and the — I'll just give you a big fat kiss."

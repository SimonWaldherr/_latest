  LeBron James, Black activists fight back against stealth voter suppression campaigns on Facebook, Instagram 
description: > 
  Now these deceptive online campaigns have returned, with activists reporting a surge on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and on private messaging apps like WhatsApp.On Wednesday, NBA champion LeBron James unveiled a new push called Under Review to challenge attempts to confuse, intimidate or misinform Black voters and dissuade them from casting their ballots.The pair launched the Win Black/Pa’lante campaign in 2019 to fire back at voter suppression campaigns with posts, videos, GIFs and internet memes, particularly in battleground states where online campaigns to sway Black voters could tilt the election.Last week, Twitter suspended a group of accounts claiming to be Black Trump supporters for violating its rules on spam and platform manipulation.!”Black voters are crucial to Biden's chances of prevailing in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida and scoring upsets in traditionally Republican states like Texas and Georgia.

Jaime Harrison, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham’s Democratic opponent in the South Carolina Senate race, criticized the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for referencing “the good old days of segregation” during Barrett’s confirmation hearing Wednesday morning — a statement Graham said was intended to be sarcastic.

Graham made the remark in a discussion about the Supreme Court’s rulings in two landmark cases that have come up repeatedly in the hearings: Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down segregation laws, and Roe v. Wade, which established abortion rights.

Barrett could voice an opinion about Brown, Graham said, because there was no active litigation related to the segregation at issue in the case.

“One of the reasons you can say with confidence that you think Brown v. Board of Education is super-precedent is that you’re not aware of any effort to go back to the good old days of segregation by a legislative body, is that correct?” Graham asked. Barrett responded in the affirmative.

Harrison’s campaign seized on the remark, saying it showed Graham was “out of touch.”

“Even as peaceful protestors demonstrate across our state for equality and justice, Lindsey can’t help but refer fondly to a time of violent oppression and segregation against African Americans,” campaign spokesman Guy King said in a statement.

“It’s 2020, not 1920. Act like it,” added Harrison, who is Black.

Others expressed alarm at Graham’s words, including Michael Steele, the first black chairman of the Republican National Committee.

Graham responded to the blowback shortly after, saying he made the statement with "deep sarcasm.”

“The point I’m trying to make is that there is nobody in the legislative arena wanting to take us back to that dark time in American history," he told reporters outside the hearing room. “I want to make sure everyone in my state moves forward. In terms of that statement, it blows my mind that anyone can believe that about me.”

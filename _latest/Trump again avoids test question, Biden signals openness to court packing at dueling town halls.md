Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R) issued a statement about his recovery from covid-19, highlighting the severity of the disease and advocating the wearing of masks, in stark contrast to Trump’s nonchalant attitude even after contracting it himself.

Christie was among those seen maskless and hugging guests a few weeks ago at a Rose Garden ceremony that many suspect was a superspreader event that caused people in Trump’s immediate orbit to catch the coronavirus, which causes the disease covid-19, including Christie.

Now that he is recovered, Christie said that all public officials should be advocating for every American to wear a mask and that “no one should be cavalier about being infected or infecting others.”

Christie shared that he had spent seven days in intensive care and had a lot of time to think. He said he was wrong not to wear a mask at the White House, where Trump does not require it or encourage it.

“I hope that my experience shows my fellow citizens that you should follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others,” Christie said, referring to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which strongly advocates mask-wearing.

The statement reads like a rebuke of the president, who emerged from his illness emboldened, continuing to downplay the virus as something that will simply go away and holding crowded events with no mask or social distancing requirements. But Christie, who like Trump was treated with an experimental antibody therapy, said getting sick made him understand how serious covid-19 is.

“Having had this virus, I can also assure those who have not had it of a few things,” Christie said. “It is something to take very seriously. The ramifications are wildly random and potentially deadly. No one should be happy to get the virus and no one should be cavalier about being infected or infecting others.”

In the statement, Christie also took the position that the nation should fully reopen, but that “every public official, regardless of party or position, should advocate for every American to wear a mask in public, appropriately socially distance and to wash your hands frequently every day.”

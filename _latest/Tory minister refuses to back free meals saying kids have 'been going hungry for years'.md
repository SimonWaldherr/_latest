 <p>Mr Scully, the Minister for London, tried to defend the Government's opposition to the plan in a disastrous BBC interview.</p> <p>Pressed on whether the Government would feed hungry children during the difficult winter months, he said: "We've had a situation where children have been going hungry under a Labour government for years.</p> <p> "We have put a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> system in place which allows flexibility for people to go back to work, topping up their incomes, so they don't have the cliff edge of the old benefit system which we saw under the old Labour government." </p> <p>Asked if it was acceptable for children to go hungry, he said: "No it's not, which is why I'm saying we have been looking at how we can help parents in the long term."</p> <p>Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said he should apologise for the "disgraceful" remarks which were a "slap in the face" for struggling families.</p> <p> She added: "  Rising child poverty and more families going hungry is the shameful legacy of the Conservatives&#8217; decade in power. </p> <p></p>

 <p>"Paul Scully should apologise for his disgraceful comment and Conservative MPs should do something about this injustice by supporting Labour's plan to ensure no child goes hungry over Christmas."</p> <p>The PM's Press Secretary said there was no change of the government&#8217;s policy on free school meals.</p> <p>He said: &#8220;We are in a different position now. Schools are open to all and the vast majority of pupils are back in school.&#8221;</p> <p>He added while schools play an important role, &#8220;it&#8217;s not for them to regularly provide food during the school holidays.&#8221;</p> <p>He said a &#163;9m holiday and food programme supported around 50,000 children across 17 council areas. But he gave no sign it will be beefed up.</p> <p>Asked if the PM agreed with Paul Scully, his Press Secretary said: &#8220;I think the PM is absolutely clear that we are ensuring that children do not go hungry and making sure the most vulnerable in our society are protected.&#8221;</p> <p>The Press Secretary refused to say how MPs would be whipped in the vote.</p> <p>Asked if the PM had spoken to Marcus Rashford, he replied: &#8220;They spoke before earlier in the year. I&#8217;m not aware of any subsequent discussions.&#8221;</p>

 <p> Mr Rashford locked horns with Tory MP Ben Bradley on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>, who claimed "extending freebies are a sticking plaster not a solution". </p> <p>Th Mansfield MP told people to "step out of the PC bubble" and realise some parents would prioritise other things over feeding their children.</p> <p> But the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and England striker responded: "Ben, the economy already pays a high price for child hunger. </p> <p>"If children were fed properly you would increase educational attainment and boost life chances."</p> <p>He called for a more "humane response", adding: "The end child food poverty debate is still to come.</p> <p>"The answer has to be long-term stability, not sticking plasters or &#8216;freebies&#8217; as Ben Bradley called it.</p> <p>"It&#8217;s about time we worked together."</p> <p>Tory former minister Steve Baker warned about the cost of Rashford's demands.</p> <p>"Everyone knows feeding hungry children is a top priority. I'd like to see UC (Universal Credit) boosted," he said.</p> <p>"But if the economy and currency collapse, the poor will be devastated. Alleging a blind eye is just wrong."</p> <p>Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons Education Committee, signalled he could back Labour's motion - and said&#160;there was "significant" support among Conservatives for extending the scheme.</p> <p>Tory&#160;MP Anne Marie Morris also said she would support the motion.</p></div>

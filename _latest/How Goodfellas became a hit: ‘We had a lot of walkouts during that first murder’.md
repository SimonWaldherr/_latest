The process of test-screening films is an inexact science, but it’s generally accepted that if members of the audience are baying for the director’s blood within five minutes, then something has gone wrong. A little over three decades ago, that was the situation facing Martin Scorsese and his producer Irwin Winkler, when they tried out their latest project – a gangster picture called Goodfellas – on an unsuspecting crowd.

Today, it’s hard to imagine Scorsese’s signature masterpiece, which opened in British cinemas 30 years ago this month, being met with anything other than rapturous acclaim. His soul-rattling adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi’s Wiseguy – a nonfiction chronicle of the life of the Brooklyn mobster turned FBI informant Henry Hill – would go on to rejuvenate not only its director’s career, but the gangster genre outright, and has been endlessly quoted and celebrated ever since.

But on that evening in the Los Angeles suburbs, its prospects looked about as rosy as those of poor Billy Batts, the luckless mafioso who is repeatedly stabbed and shot in a car boot by Joe Pesci’s Tommy DeVito and Robert De Niro’s Jimmy Conway in the film’s opening scene.

“Marty had been getting a lot of criticism from conservative groups over The Last Temptation of Christ, and the preview was in deepest Ronald Reagan country,” the 89-year-old Winker chortles down the phone in a spry New York twang from his office in Beverly Hills. “So when his name came up, some guy yelled out, ‘Hey, let’s get that guy! Let’s get Scorsese!’”

The second test screening was no more successful. “We had a lot of walkouts during that first murder,” Winkler remembers. “By the time the movie was over, I’d say three quarters of the audience had gone.” The film’s unbridled violence, plus its discombobulating moral push-pull of glamour and malevolence, was not landing as they’d hoped it would. Winkler recalls leafing through the reaction cards in the foyer afterwards and finding one which read simply: “F___ you.”

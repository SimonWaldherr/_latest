<div><p>HBO and WB Channel will cease operations in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Maldives from December 15 this year. Reasons cited for the discontinuation are low ratings, the failure to find a sustainable business model and a dynamic market shift in the television industry in South Asian countries.</p>

<p>Siddharth Jain, SVP and Managing Director, Warner Media International Division, said in a statement, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/warnermedia-to-discontinue-hbo-and-wb-tv-channels-in-india-and-select-other-south-asia-markets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>&#8220;After 20 years of successes for the HBO linear movie channel in South Asia and more than a decade with the WB linear movie channel, this was a difficult decision to make. The pay-TV industry landscape and the market dynamics have shifted dramatically, and the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for further change,&#8221;</i></a></p>

<p>Warner Media International South Asia will, however, continue to offer Cartoon Network and CNN International in South Asian markets.</p>

<p>HBO was launched in Pakistan in the mid-2000s, and ARY Media Group holds the license to it. WB Channel started operations in the early 2010s and is operated by the South Asian division of Warner Media International, which also operates Cartoon Network and CNN International in the country. Both Cartoon Network and CNN International will continue to broadcast in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Maldives.</p>

<p>In India, many of HBO&#8217;s content is available on streaming platform Disney+ HotStar. HBO has a content syndication partnership with the streaming service. In Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Maldives, neither Disney+ nor HotStar is available at the moment.</p>

<p>Another reason for the discontinuation of these channels could be the streaming platform HBOMax launched in May this year. Disney made a similar move this year in some countries by discontinuing Disney Channel, Disney Junior and Disney XD and moved its programming to streaming platform Disney+. It has not been confirmed yet if HBOMax will be available in Pakistan and other South Asian countries or if it will operate at all.</p>

<p>At present, HBOMax&#8217;s original adult animated series Close Enough and superhero series DC Titans (the first two seasons were released on DC Universe in the United States and Netflix internationally, with the upcoming third season being moved to HBOMax in the U.S) are available to stream on Netflix in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Maldives and other territories.</p>

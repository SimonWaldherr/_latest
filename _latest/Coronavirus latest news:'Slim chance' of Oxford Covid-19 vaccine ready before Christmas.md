There is a "slim" chance that the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine could be ready before Christmas, the chairwoman of the UK Vaccine Taskforce has said.

Kate Bingham said she was "hopeful" of getting trial data from the Oxford study, as well as the vaccine from Pfizer BionNTech, before the end of the year.

Both studies are currently in phase 3 clinical trials, meaning that the vaccine has been given to thousands of participants to check its safety and effectiveness - the final stage before researchers submit their data to regulators for approval.

Ms Bingham said that she felt "optimistic" from the positive data seen so far but cautioned that people should not assume that a Covid-19 vaccine would be "better" than the flu vaccine "for the moment".

" I think it's a slim chance, but there is a chance, that we could have the Oxford vaccine before Christmas," Ms Bingham said.

The UK government has six vaccine candidates in its portfolio, produced by AstraZeneca and Oxford university; BioNTech and Pfizer; Valneva; Novavax; Johnson & Johnson; and GlaxoSmithKline.

However Johnson & Johnson were forced to halt their coronavirus vaccine trial after one of its participants became sick.

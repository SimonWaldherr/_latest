President Donald Trump has done everything he can to turn the nation’s highest office into a crass reality TV show.

Now NBC News is helping. It should be ashamed.

The network announced Wednesday that it would broadcast a town hall event with Trump on Thursday in Miami, with Savannah Guthrie of the “Today” show hosting. What’s wrong with that?

It competes directly with a previously scheduled town hall that ABC is hosting with Joe Biden, Trump’s Democratic opponent, that’s what. (Locally, however, Channel 12 will air Trump's town hall delayed, at 8 p.m.) Now, if you are that mythical undecided voter media chases like a dog after a tennis ball — or just an interested citizen — you will have to either watch one and DVR the other or channel surf like crazy.

What a gigantic mistake. This is bad TV and worse journalism.

How we went from another debate to 2 town halls

The town halls are scheduled for the night that the two candidates were supposed to have their second debate. But Trump tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and would not agree to a virtual debate. Unwilling to host an in-person event, the Commission on Presidential Debates canceled it.

Despite having contracted the virus, Trump has resumed in-person campaign rallies with large crowds, where masks are neither required nor, it seems, often worn. His administration has come under fire for refusing to say when Trump last tested negative, bringing into question whether he had the virus during the first debate, which was a contentious nightmare. That debate drew 73.1 million viewers.

In its announcement Wednesday NBC News went to great lengths to make Thursday’s event sound safe.

“NBC News said it has received a statement by Dr. Clifford Lane, Clinical Director at the National Institutes of Health, indicating that he and Dr. Anthony Fauci have reviewed Trump's recent medical data, including a PCR test collected and analyzed by NIH on Tuesday, and have concluded ‘with a high degree of confidence’ that the president is ‘not shedding infectious virus,’” the statement says.

It doesn’t say whether he tested negative.

Trump's not to blame for this. It's NBC's fault

Trump and Guthrie will be at least 12 feet apart from one another and the audience, the statement goes on to say. “The audience will also be socially distanced and required to wear face masks, answer a symptoms questionnaire and take a temperature check prior to entering the outdoor venue. Every NBC News staffer will be tested on site in Miami.”

And for a fair amount of time afterwards, I’ll bet.

The blame here doesn’t fall on Trump. He’s doing his Trump thing — stomping around and demanding attention like a toddler in a toy store. This is NBC News’ fault. It's playing the role of the indulgent parent, catering to Trump’s tantrum. It may quiet him in the short term but it’s not making the situation any better.

In fact it’s making it worse.

The network has other options. Host the town hall on another night. Schedule it before, or after, Biden’s. (Not as easy, given the various time-zone issues, etc. But it’s better than competing head-to-head.) Given the choices, NBC News chose the worst one available.

Will it be good for ratings for NBC? That’s the bottom line with any network, after all. The answer is, probably not. It certainly wouldn’t be as good as having the time to yourself. Why split your audience? There’s a reason networks don’t schedule big events against the Super Bowl, which had 99.9 million viewers for the 2020 game.

Again, we expect this of Trump. Not from NBC.

At least I thought so. Not so much anymore.

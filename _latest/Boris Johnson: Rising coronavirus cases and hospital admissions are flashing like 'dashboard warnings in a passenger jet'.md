Boris Johnson has warned the UK's coronavirus data is flashing like "dashboard warnings in a passenger jet," with case numbers and transmission rates rising in all areas.

The Prime Minister's words came as he introduced a new three-tier lockdown system for England, with "medium", "high" and "very high" alert levels.

Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, has already suggested the capital could see a "high" level imposed within days, which would prevent households mixing indoors.

Mr Khan said London's alert level, which is currently at "medium", could be escalated "very quickly - potentially even this week".

"The virus is now spreading very quickly in every corner of London," his spokesman warned.

The Liverpool City Region faces the toughest local lockdown restrictions in England, while Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Leicester are among those to have escaped the worst of the new lockdown measures by being placed on the Tier 2 under the new traffic lights system.

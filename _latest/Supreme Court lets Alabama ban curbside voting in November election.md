  Supreme Court lets Alabama ban curbside voting in November election 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON â€“ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday night that Alabama can ban curbside voting in the upcoming elections, handing Republicans a victory in their battle against easing election rules because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Shorthanded following Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, the court ruled 5-3, with the remaining three liberal justices dissenting.A federal appeals court already had refused to lift an Alabama requirement that voters using absentee ballots submit affidavits signed by a notary or two adult witnesses.But the appeals court refused to let state officials block counties from employing curbside voting, leading to the latest Supreme Court case.In the 2013 case Shelby County, Ala., v. Holder, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision striking down the formula under which some states and counties were required to get Justice Department approval to change election practices.

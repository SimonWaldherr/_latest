Beyond Meat will start selling breakfast sausage links, the plant-based meat company's fourth product introduction and second breakfast-themed one so far this year.

CMO Stuart Kronauge told Business Insider that breakfast is a key expansion opportunity for Beyond Meat, especially with people eating more meals at home and relying less on restaurants.

Beyond Meat has had to adapt to making more sales at retailers during the pandemic. Its other launches this year include plant-based meatballs as well as a 10-pack of burgers aimed at keeping up with consumers' heightened demand for groceries.

Breakfast might be the most important meal of the day for consumers, but it's also become the most important meal lately for Beyond Meat.

The plant-based meat producer said Thursday that it will start selling its Beyond Breakfast Sausage Links at retailers including Kroger, Whole Foods, and Albertsons. The links, which use a sausage casing made using algae, are Beyond Meat's second new breakfast food this year, following the sausage patties it introduced earlier in 2020.

That's no accident, Beyond Meat CMO Stuart Kronauge told Business Insider in an interview. The first meal of the day has become a more attractive opportunity as consumers' diets and food buying habits change as a result of the pandemic.

"We are interested in expanding the breakfast platform," she said, particularly as "more people are eating at home" due to the continued spread of COVID-19.

"Everybody loves breakfast because you can have all different types of food," she added.

Sales of fresh plant-based breakfast meats nearly tripled in the 12 weeks ending August 9, according to data cited by Beyond Meat from provider SPINS.

Fewer people going out to eat has forced Beyond Meat to adapt fast. Before COVID-19 shuttered dining rooms starting in March, Beyond Meat's revenue was split roughly evenly between foodservice and retail sales.

During the company's second quarter, which spanned April, May, and June, about 88% of sales came from retailers, the company said in August. Net revenues during the quarter rose nearly 70%, meanwhile, as consumers relied on groceries for a larger portion of their daily meals.

"It's been a weird year, obviously," Kronauge said.

The breakfast links mark Beyond's fourth new product in 2020. In addition to the two breakfast sausages, new items include a 10-pack of Beyond Burgers as well as plant-based meatballs, which Kronauge said retailers had been asking the company to produce.

Rival Impossible Foods has also spent 2020 breaking into breakfast sausage, though the company has focused on restaurants instead of retailers. Burger King and Starbucks have offered sandwiches featuring Impossible sausage patties since this summer.

Beyond has also brought its sausage patties to restaurants through a deal with with coffee chain Dunkin', which began selling its own breakfast sandwich at Manhattan locations and has since expanded the menu item nationwide.

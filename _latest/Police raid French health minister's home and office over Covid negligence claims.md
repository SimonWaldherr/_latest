Police on Thursday raided the homes and offices of France's health minister, former prime minister, and its public health director as part of an investigation into multiple complaints that its reaction to the Covid outbreak was slow and inadequate.

News of the raids broke just hours after President Emmanuel Macron imposed a 9pm curfew on a third of the French population over nine cities, including Paris, in a bid to flatten the surging second wave of the deadly viral epidemic. Private groups are restricted to six people and private events, including weddings, are banned throughout the country.

Besides health minister Olivier Veran and public health director Jerome Salomon, Mr Veran's predecessor Agnes Buzyn, former prime minister Edouard Philippe and former government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye were also targeted by the raids.

They came after the Law Court of the Republic - a special tribunal created to try cases of ministerial misconduct - launched a judicial investigation in July into whether French leaders were guilty of a "lack of will to fight a disaster” following 90 separate complaints by doctors, local authorities and nursing homes.

Mr Salomon abruptly canceled an early-morning live interview on the national BFMTV due to "personal reasons," according to the network.

The health ministry said the searches were conducted in a calm and “courteous” manner. The office of Mr Philippe, who stepped down as prime minister in July, to reclaim his post as mayor of Le Havre, northern France, said he had “always said he is at the disposal of the justice system”.

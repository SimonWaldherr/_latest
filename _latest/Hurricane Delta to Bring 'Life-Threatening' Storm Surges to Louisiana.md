Water levels in the coastal areas will rise quickly Friday, and "efforts to protect life and property should be rushed to completion." Delta is expected to make landfall over southwestern Louisiana between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.

While the storm is weakening, hurricane force winds will impact portions of southwest Louisiana and spread inland across portions of southern Louisiana through Friday evening, according to the center.

Heavy rainfall will cause significant flash flooding and flooding in parts of Louisiana on Friday and Saturday. Additional flooding is expected across portions of the central Gulf Coast and into the lower Mississippi Valley.

The Louisiana Office of the State Fire Marshal has hundreds of search and rescue personnel on standby, and the Louisiana National Guard has nearly 3,000 personnel, as well as high-water vehicles and helicopters ready to assist.

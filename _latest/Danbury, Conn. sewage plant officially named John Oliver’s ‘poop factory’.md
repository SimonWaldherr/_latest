In Connecticut, John Oliver is now No. 2 in comedy.

The Danbury City Council voted this week to name a sewer plant after the potty-mouthed “Last Week Tonight” comedian as a response to him making the town the butt of his jokes.

“Congratulations, Mr. Oliver,” the city’s mayor, Mark Boughton said, according to the News-Times. “You now have a poop plant named after you.”

Local lawmakers voted 18 to 1 on Thursday night to approve the “John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant” after the British funnyman went on a curse-laced comedic rant, calling the suburb mind-numbingly dull back in August.

“If you are going to forget a town in Connecticut, why not forget Danbury because — and this is true — f–k Danbury,” Oliver said on the segment, which aired Aug. 16.

It’s still not clear why Oliver chose to single-out Danbury — but he sarcastically quipped that the suburb boasts a “charming railway museum” and a “historic Hearthstone Castle” before declaring: “Danbury Connecticut can eat my whole a—.”

He added, “[It’s] a sad, empty void where hope goes to die.”

The week after the show aired, Boughton pooh-poohed the comedian as he floated the sewer plant idea.

“We are going to rename [the facility] the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant,” Boughton said in a Facebook video. “Why? Because it’s full of crap just like you, John.”

Oliver responded on Aug. 30 by challenging the town to do it — and offering to donate $55,000 to local charities if it actually followed through.

“Now that you floated it as an option, it is all that I want,” Oliver said.

The city council soon received roughly 100 letters in support of the name — but some council members weren’t convinced on Thursday.

Councilman John Esposito said that while Oliver’s jokes clearly stink, he can’t support the new sewer title.

“I personally don’t find anything funny about insulting our community,” he said after voting against it. “Sorry to be a party pooper here. That’s just really how I feel.”

But councilman Roberto Alves delighted in taking the piss out of Oliver.

“This was a much-needed laugh,” council member Roberto Alves told the paper. “If John Oliver wants a poop factory named after him, in his own words, ‘cool.’ ”

Other city officials, including deputy corporation counsel Laslo Pinter, said the name should be considered purely “ceremonial.”

Reps for Oliver and HBO didn’t return requests for comment Friday.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that it currently appears unlikely that the White House and Congressional Democrats will agree on and push through a coronavirus stimulus package before the election.

"At this point, getting something done before the election and executing on that will be difficult," Mnuchin said at a conference held by the Milken Institute, a nonprofit think tank, though he noted that the two sides are continuing their discussions.

Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have been locked in on-again, off-again negotiations for months over another pandemic relief bill.

President Donald Trump last week instructed White House officials to pull out of talks until after the election but reversed course after stocks plunged and members of his own party criticized the move.

Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke for an hour Wednesday morning and had a "comprehensive" discussion, Mnuchin said.

The House passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus package earlier this month, a scaled-down version of a heftier bill the chamber approved this summer. The White House recently countered that offer with a $1.8 trillion proposal, which was panned by both Pelosi, who dubbed it insufficient in several areas, and congressional Republicans, who said it was too costly.

"A fly on the wall or wherever else it might land in the Oval Office tells me that the President only wants his name on a check to go out before Election Day and for the market to go up," Pelosi said of the White House's offer in a letter to Democratic colleagues Tuesday, making a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fly that landed on Vice President Mike Pence's head during the vice presidential debate last week. Pelosi outlined eight "deficiencies" in the White House's offer, including in state and local government funding, rental assistance and small business aid.

Mnuchin said Wednesday that there was not only disagreement over the top-line cost of the package but also over specific policy provisions within the bill, including the funding for states and localities. Trump has repeatedly signaled his resistance to "bailing out" states and cities run by Democratic leaders.

"We continue to make progress on certain issues. On certain issues, we continue to be far apart," Mnuchin said.

Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, said in a statement that "one major area of disagreement continues to be that the White House lacks an understanding of the need for a national strategic testing plan." Hammill said Pelosi and Mnuchin plan to speak again Thursday.

Mnuchin on Wednesday criticized Pelosi for not being open to a stand-alone relief bill for the airline industry, which has cut tens of thousands of jobs this month. Pelosi said last week that she would not support a narrow airline stimulus bill without the promise of a more comprehensive economic package.

<div><p>De Ridder: I&#8217;ll Take Aung La N Sang Down And Choke Him Out</p><p class="p1"><a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/reinier-de-ridder/">Reinier &#8220;The Dutch Knight&#8221; De Ridder</a> is gearing up for the biggest match in his mixed martial arts career.</p>
<p class="p1">On Friday, 30 October, the undefeated Dutchman will challenge two-division ONE World Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/aung-la-n-sang/">Aung La &#8220;The Burmese Python&#8221; N Sang</a> for the middleweight belt at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/inside-the-matrix/">ONE: INSIDE THE MATRIX</a> in Singapore.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;This is what I&#8217;ve been working for basically my whole life,&#8221; De Ridder says.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on the mat <a href="https://www.onefc.com/features/how-an-ill-fated-training-session-fueled-reinier-de-ridder-to-greatness/">since I was 5 years old</a>, and this is going to be my crowning moment.&#8221;</p>
<p class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"></p>
<p class="p1">The 33-year-old De Ridder&#160;has brilliantly used his black belt judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu expertise to great effect.</p>
<p class="p1">Since his professional <a href="https://www.onefc.com/category/mixed-martial-arts/">mixed martial arts</a> debut in 2013, he&#8217;s racked up a spotless 12-0 record, a 93 percent finishing rate, and thrilling stoppage victories over the likes of <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/fan-rong/">&#8220;King Kong Warrior&#8221; Fan Rong</a> and <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/gilberto-galvao/">Gilberto &#8220;Giba&#8221; Galvao</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Then this past February, the Breda, Netherlands, resident utilized his immense reach and striking to defeat five-time BJJ World Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/leandro-ataides/">Leandro &#8220;Wolf&#8221; Ataides</a> via <a href="https://www.onefc.com/news/de-ridder-defeats-ataides-to-book-bout-against-aung-la-n-sang/">unanimous decision</a>. With the win, he booked his shot to challenge for Aung La N Sang&#8217;s ONE Middleweight World Championship. </p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Aung La, are you ready? You pick the place, you pick the time, you pick the date &#8211; you deserve it &#8211; but keep that belt shiny &#8217;cause I am coming for it,&#8221; De Ridder declared following his victory.</p>

 

<p class="p1">Eight-and-a-half months later, De Ridder will attempt to win that shiny belt in Singapore, but he&#8217;ll need to take it from a true icon of the sport.</p>
<p class="p1">Aung La N Sang has been on an absolute tear since claiming the ONE Middleweight World Championship in June 2017. </p>
<p class="p1">The Myanmar hero is riding a seven-bout winning streak that includes victories over four-time Muay Thai and Kickboxing World Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/alain-ngalani/">Alain &#8220;The Panther&#8221; Ngalani</a>, battle-hardened Japanese veteran <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/ken-hasegawa/">Ken Hasegawa</a>, and most recently, ONE Heavyweight World Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/brandon-vera/">Brandon &#8220;The Truth&#8221; Vera</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">During that span, <a href="https://www.onefc.com/news/aung-la-n-sang-captures-second-world-title-with-stunning-ko/">he also defeated Alexandre &#8220;Bebezao&#8221; Machado</a> in 56 seconds to claim the vacant ONE Light Heavyweight World Title.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-148702" src="https://cdn.onefc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reinier-De-Ridder-DC-1857.jpg" alt="Reinier De Ridder defeats Gilberto Galvao" width="1920" height="1280"></p>
<p class="p1">The Dutchman has watched Aung La N Sang&#8217;s epic journey through ONE Championship and is well aware of the skill set he&#8217;ll be up against &#8211; especially the devastating striking repertoire that has felled so many opponents.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;He&#8217;s got a great right hand and a great right kick. He switches a little bit, and he&#8217;s got a typical Dutch kickboxing style,&#8221; De Ridder says.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;He has great punches and great pressure, so he&#8217;s good all-around. And don&#8217;t forget he&#8217;s a good wrestler, too. He is good on the ground, as well. He is nobody to be taken lightly. He&#8217;s a great fighter.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">While De Ridder respects his opponent&#8217;s all-around game, he isn&#8217;t looking to engage in a firefight. Instead, he&#8217;ll look to utilize his greatest strength.&#160;</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take him down and choke him out,&#8221; he states. &#8220;The guy is very tough. He is almost impossible to knock out. But everybody has a neck, and I can find it everywhere.&#8221;</p>
 
<p class="p1">In preparation for this bout, De Ridder has been training at Combat Brothers in Breda alongside fellow ONE athlete <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/pieter-buist/">Pieter &#8220;The Archangel&#8221; Buist</a> and multiple-time Mixed Martial Arts World Champion Gegard &#8220;The Dreamcatcher&#8221; Mousasi, both of whom have helped elevate his stand-up arsenal.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I have some of the best strikers in the world around me and they&#8217;ve been teaching me a lot, so I&#8217;ve been making a lot of progress there,&#8221; De Ridder says.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;My striking is pretty basic. I put on the pressure, make [my opponent] walk backward, and I take him down.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a style that has worked brilliantly for De Ridder to date, and one that he believes will carry him to more success in &#8220;The Lion City.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">By combining his forward-pressure style of striking with his lethal submission prowess, &#8220;The Dutch Knight&#8221; believes he has the perfect strategy to take out &#8220;The Burmese Python.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The most important thing is pushing him back,&#8221; De Ridder continues. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to push him back, put him against the fence, take him down, use my judo and my wrestling, and then get to his back.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-148714" src="https://cdn.onefc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reinier-De-Ridder-DC-1886.jpg" alt="Reinier De Ridder celebrates his victory against" width="1920" height="1280"></p>
<p class="p1">Now just 10 days out from the biggest fight of his career, De Ridder is feeling very confident that he&#8217;ll achieve his dream and capture the belt.</p>
<p>Along the way, he plans to cherish the moment with his biggest supporters.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to celebrate it,&#8221; he says. </p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take it all in and yeah, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m going to be remembering for the rest of my life. It&#8217;s something that will make my kids proud, make my wife proud, and make everyone around me proud, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to that.&#8221;</p>

How to shop for Amazon Prime Day tech deals

For starters, always double-check the product maker's suggested price and what the product is going for at other retailers before clicking the "Add to cart" button on. Sometimes brands inflate the value of an item before slashing the price, so it seems like you're getting a good deal, when really that sale price is pretty widely available, or the item usually retails for less elsewhere.

Likewise, don't stop your search at Amazon for Prime Day tech deals. There are plenty of other retailers offering tech discounts to compete with the 800-pound gorilla in the room, namely Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Find links to our coverage of those deals events below.

If what you're after is a brand new product or category you don't have experience with, definitely look out for editorial reviews before making that purchase decision. The user reviews on retailer sites are more often than not cooked up by the seller or third parties to drive sales, so be careful. As a team of product experts who review and write about the best tech you can buy for a living, we humbly recommend that you search for a Business Insider review or guide for any product you're looking at to see if we've had the chance to test it out personally.

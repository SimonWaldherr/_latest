President Trump on Monday urged Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to bring legal action against women who accused him of sexual misconduct ahead of and during his 2018 confirmation hearings.

“He [Kavanaugh] should sue the women, and all of those who illegally worked with them, for false and disgusting accusations!!!” the president tweeted.

Trump offered the advice in a retweet of a post sent by Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee as a new round of nomination hearings kicked off for prospective justice Amy Coney Barrett.

“Remember what they did to Brett Kavanaugh. We don’t owe the Democrats anything,” that message read. “#ConfirmACB”

Shortly after Trump nominated him in 2018 to fill the seat of retiring associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh was publicly accused of sexual misconduct against multiple women in his younger days.

One accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testified before Congress during the contentious hearings, alleging that an intoxicated Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a house party while they were in high school in the 80s.

That allegation highlighted tense hearings in which Kavanaugh was grilled by Democratic lawmakers over claims of misconduct and alcohol abuse during his youth.

Kavanaugh, who has denied all allegations of sexual wrongdoing, was ultimately confirmed in a bitter partisan vote.

While she faces no allegations of that level, Barrett too appears in for a contentious confirmation process, with Democrats voicing fears that loyalty to Trump and her Catholic faith might cloud her judgment as a jurist.

Those hearings kicked off Monday and run through Thursday.

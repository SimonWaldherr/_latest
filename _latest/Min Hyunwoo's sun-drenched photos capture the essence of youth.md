For the 32-year-old <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/gallery/south-korea-photographers-capture-loneliness/index.html" target="_blank">South Korean</a> photographer, it's a period reminiscent of his childhood -- an opportunity to relive vivid memories and create new, long-lasting ones.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"Summer is so short and fleeting," the photographer said. "We have to wait so long to experience it again yet it's interesting because it seems like we remember memories made in the summer forever."</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Based in Seoul, Min is a fashion photographer whose images feature models draped in colorful garments, and posing in playful ways. His work has appeared in Highsnobriety and Nylon Japan. </p><p id="ad_rect_atf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">In Min's latest series, "We Are Going to Live This Summer," young men and women play in a large lake, submerging themselves at varying depths. Capturing subjects splashing, dragging their bodies through the water or playing with giant lotus leaves and lavender buds, the photographs demonstrate the subtle tenderness of youth.   </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Below, Min discusses how he uses the afternoon sun and moving water to convey emotion.</p><p id="ad_nat_btf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200717052903-restricted-02-min-hyunwoo-explores-youth-in-photos.jpg" alt='"We Are Going to Live This Summer" was shot during sunset.

I learned very early on to play in nature and am good at spending time outside.  </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">As a child, I enjoyed sitting by the water. It's something I still like to do to this day. When l watch flowing water, I feel a sense of resolution. On the other hand, I don't enjoy going into the water because I can feel my temperature drop very quickly. I also can't swim. I wanted to explore this dichotomy in my work. </p><p id="ad_rect_btf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">When I stare at water for a while, I sometimes start to think that it has feelings (of its own).</p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200717060914-restricted-10-min-hyunwoo-explores-youth-in-photos.jpg" alt='"I would tell them to open their eyes in a more calm or subtle way, or to slowly move from left to right," said the photographer.

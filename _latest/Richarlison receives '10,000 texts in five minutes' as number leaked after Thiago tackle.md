 <p>     </p> <p> He confessed his &#8220;mistake&#8221; seconds later as the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> player picked up although he began their conversation by mentioning Carlison&#8217;s red card tackle and asking him: &#8220;What happened yesterday? That was a real flying tackle.&#8221; </p> <p>He could be seen laughing as he told his friend: &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve just shown your number without meaning to.</p> <p>&#8220;I swear it was an accident.&#8221;</p> <p>Getting the Everton forward to say &#8216;hello&#8217; to fans as his number started to go viral, he added: &#8220;We&#8217;re online. Give a wave.</p> <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to have to change your number now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richarlison responded: &#8220;Hey guys, whoever calls me is going to be blocked, don&#8217;t call me.&#8221;</p> <p> But the warning failed to work, with the footballer taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> shortly afterwards to brand the PSG forward a &#8220;genius&#8221; and reveal: &#8220;In five minutes I&#8217;ve already had 10,000 messages.

President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will participate in dueling town halls Thursday on competing television networks in lieu of a second presidential debate.

The announcement from NBC News on Wednesday morning that Trump and his campaign agreed to participate in a town hall hosted by "Today" show host Savannah Guthrie comes after the president scuttled the previously agreed upon Oct. 15 town hall-style debate when the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced the event would be virtual in the wake of Trump's coronavirus diagnosis.

That debate was slated to be moderated by C-SPAN's Steve Scully, and undecided voters would gather in Miami, as originally planned, to pose questions to Trump and Biden.

"I'm not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That is not what debating is all about," the president said after the format changed. "You sit behind a computer and do a debate, it's ridiculous."

The NBC town hall will take place outdoors in Miami, where Trump and Guthrie will sit 12 feet apart. Attendees will be required to wear masks.

Biden, meanwhile, will participate in a town hall in Philadelphia on Thursday, which will be hosted by George Stephanopoulos of ABC News.

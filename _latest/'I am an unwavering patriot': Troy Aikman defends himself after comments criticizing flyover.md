  'I am an unwavering patriot': Troy Aikman defends himself after comments criticizing flyover 
description: > 
  Fox announcers Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were captured on audio Sunday seemingly criticizing and mocking a flyover done before the Packers-Buccaneers game at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium.Apparently, Aikman received some criticisms for the remarks, because he took to Twitter on Tuesday to defend himself and explain his comments."I love a flyover but it was odd to see one over a mostly empty stadium," Aikman wrote."That's a lot of jet fuel just to do a little flyover," Aikman said."That stuff ain't happening with (a) Kamala (Harris)-(Joe) Biden ticket, I'll tell you that right now, partner," Aikman replied.

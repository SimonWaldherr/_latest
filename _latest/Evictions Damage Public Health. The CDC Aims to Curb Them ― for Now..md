  Evictions Damage Public Health. The CDC Aims to Curb Them ― for Now. 
description: > 
  That move — a moratorium from the country's top public health agency — spotlights a message experts have preached for years without prompting much policy action: Housing stability and health are intertwined.When local governments issue stay-at-home orders in the name of public health, they presume that residents have a home."The balance of harms and the public interest favor upholding the law to protect the public health and economic well-being of tenants and the public in general during this health and economic emergency."In Indiana, more than 36,000 people applied for that state's $40 million rental assistance program before the application deadline.Groups representing landlords urge passage of rental assistance, too, although some oppose the CDC order.

<div><p><b>By Bram Sable-Smith, Wisconsin Public Radio; Martha Bebinger, WBUR;</b> <b>and Darian Benson, Side Effects Public Media</b></p><p>In August, Robert Pettigrew was working a series of odd jobs. While washing the windows of a cellphone store he saw a sign, one that he believes the "good Lord" placed there for him.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>"Facing eviction?" the sign read. "You could be eligible for up to $3,000 in rent assistance. Apply today."</p><p>It seemed a hopeful omen after a series of financial and health blows. In March, Pettigrew, 52, learned he has an invasive mass on his lung that restricts his breathing. His doctor told him his condition puts him at high risk of developing deadly complications from COVID-19 and advised him to stop working as a night auditor at a Motel 6, where he manned the front desk. Reluctantly, he had to leave that job and start piecing together other work.</p><p>With pay coming in less steadily, Pettigrew and his wife, Stephanie, fell behind on the rent. Eventually, they were many months late, and the couple's landlord filed to evict them.</p><p>Then Pettigrew saw the rental assistance sign.</p><p>"There were nights I would lay in bed and my wife would be asleep, and all I could do was say, 'God, you need to help me. We need you,'" Pettigrew said. "And here he came. He showed himself to us."</p><p>As many as&#160;<a href="https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/The_Eviction_Crisis_080720.pdf" target="_blank">40 million Americans</a> faced a looming eviction risk in August, according to a report authored by 10 national housing and eviction experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited that estimate in early September when it ordered an unprecedented, nationwide&#160;<a href="https://www.wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-19654.pdf" target="_blank">eviction moratorium</a> through the end of 2020.</p><p>That move &#8212; a moratorium from the country's top public health agency &#8212; spotlights a message experts have preached for years without prompting much policy action: Housing stability and health are intertwined.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>The CDC is now citing stable housing as a vital tool to control the coronavirus,&#160;which has <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases" target="_blank">killed more than 200,000 Americans</a>. Home is where people isolate themselves to avoid transmitting the virus or becoming infected. When local governments issue stay-at-home orders in the name of public health, they presume that residents have a home. For people who have the virus, home is often where they recover from COVID-19's fever, chills and dry cough &#8212; in lieu of, or after, a hospital stay.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>But the moratorium is&#160;<a href="https://milwaukeenns.org/2020/09/15/rent-is-still-due-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-federal-order-to-halt-residential-evictions/" target="_blank">not automatic</a>.

It directed Pettigrew to&#160;<a href="https://communityadvocates.net/" target="_blank">Community Advocates</a>, a Milwaukee nonprofit that received $7 million in federal pandemic stimulus funds to help administer a local rental aid program. More than 3,800 applications for assistance have flooded the agency, said Deborah Heffner, its housing strategy director, while tens of thousands more applications have flowed to a separate agency administering <a href="https://milwaukeenns.org/2020/07/07/social-development-commission-continues-struggle-to-keep-up-with-deluge-of-applicants-for-emergency-rental-assistance-program/" target="_blank">the state's rental relief program</a>&#160;in Milwaukee.</p><p>Persistence helped the Pettigrews break through the backlog.</p><p>"I blew their phone up," said Stephanie Pettigrew, with a smile.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>She qualifies for federal Social Security Disability Insurance, which sends her $400 to $900 in monthly assistance. That income has become increasingly vital since March when Robert left his motel job.</p><p>He has since pursued a host of odd jobs to keep food on the table &#8212; such as the window-washing he was doing when he saw the rental assistance sign &#8212; work where he can limit his exposure to the virus. He brings home $40 on a good day, he said, $10 on a bad one. Before they qualified for rent assistance, February had been the last time the Pettigrews could fully pay their $600 monthly rent bill.</p><p>Just as their finances tightened and their housing situation became less stable, the couple welcomed more family members. Heavenly, Robert's adult daughter, arrived in May from <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/missouri/st-louis-city" target="_blank">St. Louis</a> after the child care center where she worked shut down because of concerns over the coronavirus. She brought along her 3-year-old son.</p><p>Through its order, the CDC hopes to curtail evictions, which can add family members and friends to already stressed households.

Tony Evers was one of the first governors to lift a state moratorium on evictions during the pandemic &#8212; thereby enabling about 8,000 eviction filings from late May to early September, according to a search of an&#160;<a href="https://wcca.wicourts.gov/" target="_blank">online database</a>&#160;of Wisconsin circuit courts.</p><p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin's most populous city, has seen nearly half of those filings, which have largely hit the city's <a href="https://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2020/08/wisconsin-evictions-emergency-aid-falls-short/" target="_blank">Black-majority neighborhoods</a>, according to an&#160;<a href="https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/" target="_blank">Eviction Lab</a>&#160;analysis.</p><p>In other states, housing advocates note similar disparities.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>"Poor neighborhoods, neighborhoods of color, have higher rates of asthma and blood pressure &#8212; which, of course, are all health issues that the COVID pandemic is then being impacted by," said Amy Nelson, executive director of the <a href="https://www.fhcci.org/" target="_blank">Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana</a>.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"This deadly virus is killing people disproportionately in Black and brown communities at alarming rates," said Dee Ross, founder of the Indianapolis Tenants Rights Union.

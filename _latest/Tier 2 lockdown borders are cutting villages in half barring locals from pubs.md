 <p>     </p> <p>And in Bures, which straddles the border of Suffolk and Essex, residents are allowed to socialise in one pub, but at the other just 350 yards down the road, they are not.</p> <p>Bures is home to around 1,400 residents, and now invisible divide, with Suffolk in Tier 1 area, and Essex Tier 2.</p> <p>It means that The Eight Bells, in Essex, and Three Horseshoes, in Suffolk, now face different rules.</p> <p>Willy Amos, 83, landlord of the Eight Bells, told Mail Online: "It is a bit confusing, they can come over here and we can't go over to there - it's a tale of two villages.</p> <p>"We have only really had one day of it, we don't have a clue what is going to happen, it certainly is not going to help."</p>

 <p>Dave Mather, 69, owns a three bedroom terraced house on the Derbyshire side of Portland Road in Langwith.</p> <p>He said: "The whole thing is absolutely crazy - tier one ends at my garden wall.</p> <p>"I can go out of my front door and walk four or five feet then find myself in a different tier, it's very odd.</p> <p>"I have friends who live across the street from me that I can't see anymore, I just have to shout to them from over here.</p> <p>"Considering we live in the same village on the same street I don't see how that makes any sense.</p> <p>"The village has been divided in two, that's not right.</p> <p>"The whole thing is silly."</p>

 <p>Grandad-of-three Dave has lived in Langwith his whole life and in the same house for 43 years.</p> <p>He said he had "never seen anything" like what's happening now and has called for a change in the way the tier system is implemented.</p> <p>The retired miner said: "The people across the road should be considered Derbyshire and therefore in the same tier as us.</p> <p>"It's quite a simple fix that would make life easier for everyone."</p> <p> The village was split in two last week when Nottinghamshire was plunged into tier two, with the city recording the highest <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> rates in the country. </p> <p>Meanwhile Derbyshire remains in tier one.</p> <p>Parish councillor Kath Sharpe, 72, has slammed the implementation of restrictions and called for "common sense" to be applied.</p>

<p>She said: "The situation is bizarre.</p> <p>"We should have been looked at as a community as opposed to two separate groups.</p> <p>"We're a tiny little rural village that has found ourselves stuck in the middle.</p> <p>"The people here don't want or deserve to be split up like this, everyone has behaved impeccably throughout the pandemic."</p> <p>According to the new tier system guidelines, areas in tier one must abide by the same rules previously enforced across the country.</p>   <p>People there cannot meet in groups of more than six unless they're part of a larger household or in a support bubble.</p> <p>Those living under tier two restrictions are prohibited from meeting indoors socially with people they do not live with, including in pubs and restaurants.</p> <p>They can meet friends and family outside, but no more than six people at a time are allowed to congregate.</p> <p>As in tier one, people in support bubbles can continue to see each other.</p></div>

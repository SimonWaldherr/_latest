  Nigerian scientists develop cheaper and faster Covid-19 test kits 
description: > 
  (CNN) Scientists in Nigeria have developed a cheaper and faster Covid-19 test kit that will enable testing to be ramped up in a place that has faced kit shortages and chronic under-testing of a massive population, according to the country's health authorities.The new test is cheaper than other PCR tests -- the most common type of test -- and can give results in less than 40 minutes, the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) said.The diagnostic test kit will cost less than $25 and samples can be analyzed using a mobile machine that can be operated by low-skilled personnel with minimal training, the agency said."We saw the need for more testing outfits, especially one that can give results in a short time because hospitals were refusing to treat patients without Covid-19 results," Babatunde Salako, the director of NIMR, told CNN.We bought the machine and adapted the kit that we developed to work with this machine.

With this one, all the people in villages and remote areas can be tested by moving the machine to those villages," Salako, who has headed the agency since 2016 said.&#160;</p><a></a><p>So far, Nigeria has recorded more than 59,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 1,000 deaths as of October 2, according to figures from the <a href="https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/" target="_blank">Nigeria Centre for Disease Control</a> </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Health authorities also report a declining number of cases, with treatment centers, known as isolation centers, being closed in the country.&#160;</p><a></a><p>Nigeria has Africa's largest population and has tested only about 500,000 people, <a href="https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/" target="_blank">according to figures</a> from local health authorities. The PCR test is the most widespread and accurate diagnostic test</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">for determining whether someone is currently infected with coronavirus.&#160;</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">However, the tests require specialized supplies, expensive instruments, and the expertise of trained lab technicians, which has led to shortages and a testing gap globally.&#160;</p><p class="el__video__close--standard js__video__close--standard el__storyelements--close cnn-icon"></p><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="How Nigeria&amp;#39;s ruling class has been hit by Covid.

And sometimes, health officials have had to <a href="https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/covid-19-20-states-yet-to-have-testing-laboratories.html" target="_blank">transfer samples</a> to other states to confirm results because of a shortage of kits.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"It has always been my concern and passion to see that Nigeria doesn't have to take samples outside to diagnose. We have scientists who are capable of this if they have the necessary support. That was what led to a visit to Senegal and&#160;China,&#160;We had collaboration to train our people&#160;in pathogen detection,&#160;even before Covid started, we went in August and September 2019 to train our scientists."&#160;</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Salako said the test kits will be mass-produced once validated by the regulatory authorities -- the Nigeria Center for Disease Control and the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria.&#160;"We do not expect the validation to take so long. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"The only limitation is that we have to produce more samples of these kits and acquire some new machines that are key to our work.

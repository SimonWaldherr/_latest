Gal Gadot was just trying to lift people’s spirits with her video of celebs singing John Lennon’s “Imagine,” which was deemed tone-deaf by many amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Sometimes, you know, you try and do a good deed and it’s just not the right good deed,” the “Wonder Woman” star told Vanity Fair. “I had nothing but good intentions and it came from the best place, and I just wanted to send light and love to the world.”

Gadot, 35, partnered with Kristen Wiig, Mark Ruffalo, Will Ferrell, Natalie Portman, Sia, Norah Jones and other Hollywood elites for the sing-along montage released in March — at the onset of quarantine.

“I started with a few friends, and then I spoke to Kristen [Wiig],” the Israeli actress explained. “Kristen is like the mayor of Hollywood. Everyone loves her, and she brought a bunch of people to the game.”

One Twitter user critiqued the video, “I’ve always hated this song. Imagine no possessions’ sung by some of the wealthiest people in the world.”

Another commented at the time, “BOO, donate if you really care abt the world rn.”

Gadot took ownership of the fact that the badly-received video was her idea, but added, “I can only say that I meant to do something good and pure, and it didn’t transcend.”

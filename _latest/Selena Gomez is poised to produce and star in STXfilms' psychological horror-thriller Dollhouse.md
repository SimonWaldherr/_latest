Selena Gomez has signed on to produce the upcoming psychological horror-thriller, Dollhouse, according to Deadline.

In addition to working behind the camera, the 28-year-old performer is said to have her eyes on the leading role of the fright-fest, which is being written by up-and-comer Michael Paisley.

'Selena's involvement is an exciting direction for this project. She is supremely talented as both a star and a producer,' STXfilms chairman Adam Fogelson said in a statement of Gomez, who currently stars and executive produces Selena+Chef.

Starring and producing: In addition to working behind the camera, the 28-year-old performer reportedly has her eyes on the film's leading role, written by up-and-comer Michael Paisley

He added: 'Teaming Selena with Shawn and Dan's expertise in the horror-thriller genre will elevate Dollhouse and we couldn't be more thrilled by the way this is being developed.'

The film's spirit is drawing comparisons to 2010's Black Swan, but has kept its plot tightly under wraps, apart from being set in the 'upper echelon of New York City's fashion scene.'

The Wolves singer has previously served as an executive producer on 13 Reasons Why, Hotel Transylvania 4, Broken Hearts Gallery, and Living Undocumented.

While she has stayed busy amid the COVID-19 pandemic with the launch of her Rare Beauty make-up line in September, the star also admitted she's been battling 'a bit of depression' lately.

Earlier this week, the singer spoke on Instagram Live with Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as Surgeon General from 2014 until 2017, to mark World Mental Health Day on Saturday.

'In the beginning, I couldn't deal with it that well. I kind of went into a bit of a depression,' the entertainer said. 'My job is a lot of travel, connecting with people, making people happy, and that makes me happy, so it has been a struggle.'

'I went into a place where I was writing and being active; it forced me to have that time,' she added. 'I've been able to spend time with those quality people a lot more than I ever have, and I'm spending a lot more time with my family.'

Gomez said that seeing her projects come together and returning to recording have helped ease her strain amid the tough times.

She continued: 'So I would say right now, I'm fully coming out again and I just think I had to handle it the way I needed to handle it, and I got through it with the right people and doing the right things and doing the right steps to not make me go crazy.'

The Texas native said that she's using her platform to forward mental health funding: 'I've worked on personal things like a beauty line that has a goal of reaching $100 million in 10 years for mental health.'

Amazon Prime Day 2020 is delivering hundreds of gaming deals on day two of the sale, which ends tonight on October 14 at 11:59 p.m. PT. Whether you're looking for discounts on controllers, games and accessories, or looking for a monitor, mouse or keyboard to upgrade your gaming PC, Prime Day offers some of the best gaming deals of the year.

We're seeing deals on games and accessories for the year's most popular gaming console, the Nintendo Switch. Prime Day 2020 is happening less than a month before the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles, so don't expect many PlayStation 4 and Xbox One deals.

Popular PC gaming companies like Razer, Logitech, and SteelSeries also drop their products to all-time low prices during Prime Day, so we'll be on the lookout for more lightning deals as we update this post regularly with the latest deals on the last day of Prime Day.

Prime Day doesn't have too many sales on individual games yet, but Best Buy is offering a sale on dozens of PlayStation and Xbox titles during Prime Day as a part of its competing "Pre-Black Friday" sale. Walmart is also price matching Amazon for certain Switch sales during Prime Day, if you're not a Prime member already.

Live Amazon Prime Day Nintendo Switch deals

Amazon has discounted several popular Nintendo Switch games by 33% for Prime Day, including "Super Mario Bros U. Deluxe," "Yoshi's Crafted World," "Splatoon 2," and "Super Mario Party."

Live Amazon Prime Day PC gaming deals

PC Gaming continues to become more accessible with cheaper parts and accessories, and Prime Day brings deep discounts from top brands like Logitech, SteelSeries, and Acer.

There are already some excellent gaming mice and mechanical keyboards on sale. On top of those below, we've seen deals for other gaming laptops, like $600 off the Razer Blade 15 advanced gaming laptop and $370 off the Gigabyte AERO 15 laptop.

Live Amazon Prime Day PlayStation 4 deals

With the PlayStation 5 about a month away from release, we expected the buzz for deals on anything PlayStation 4-related to be relatively quiet. Though that certainly is the case this year, one game in particular, "The Last of Us Part II," is on sale for just $39.88 (some $20 cheaper than its standard price). When it released back in July, we called it a "masterpiece" and a "once in a generation game." It's that good.

Live Amazon Prime Day gaming headset deals

The rise of online gaming has made a headset an invaluable tool for communicating with your team and hearing potential enemies while you play. Even consoles like the PlayStation and Nintendo Switch now support surround sound headsets to help gamers stay locked in and focused.

Features on gaming headsets can vary widely given the range of sound options and choices for wireless and amplified headsets, but Prime Day offers a solid selection for sale.

Live Amazon Prime gaming monitor deals

Monitors have been in relatively short supply due to the increased number of people working from home, but Prime Day 2020 has deals on some of the most popular models for gamers.

High refresh rate monitors are increasingly popular among PC gamers who crave faster response time for competitive games, and the upcoming PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles have been upgraded to reach higher refresh rates too.

How to shop for the best gaming deals during Prime Day 2020

With the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X due out shortly, it's not a great time to go shopping for a new video game console. Instead, it could be a good time to upgrade to a surround sound headset, premium controller, or a high refresh rate monitor to get ready for the next generation of gaming hardware.

If you're satisfied with your current gaming setup, you can check out one of our game buying guides for PlayStation or Nintendo Switch to decide which game you want to pick up next.

Also, remember that while Amazon lists thousands of gaming products, many of the most popular Prime Day sales are also available at competitors like Best Buy and Walmart. Be sure to compare prices and make sure you're not settling for a worse version of an everyday product (like a controller) just because it's on Amazon.

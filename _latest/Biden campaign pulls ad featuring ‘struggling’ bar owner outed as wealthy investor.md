<div><p>Joe Biden&#8217;s campaign has scrapped a political ad featuring a Michigan music venue owner <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/struggling-bar-owner-in-biden-ad-is-wealthy-angel-investor/">who depicted himself</a> as a cash-strapped business owner &#8212; yet was revealed as a wealthy tech investor.</p>
<p>The ad was removed from Biden&#8217;s campaign YouTube channel after reports outing the financial status of Joe Malcoun, owner of an Ann Arbor bar and music venue, the Blind Pig.</p>
<p>In the ad, Malcoun complained about his venue&#8217;s pandemic struggles, laying the blame on President Trump&#8217;s coronavirus response.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how much longer we can survive not having any revenue,&#8221; he lamented in the ad. &#8220;This is the reality of Trump&#8217;s COVID response &#8230; This is Donald Trump&#8217;s economy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My only hope for my family and this business and my community is that Joe Biden wins this election,&#8221; he claimed, saying it &#8220;makes me so angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malcoun, however, <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/all-about-ann-arbor/2018/04/14/getting-to-know-ann-arbor-tech-entrepreneur-joe-malcoun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is reportedly</a> well-known in his community as a wealthy angel investor in tech companies who acquired his fortune from a huge inheritance from his wife&#8217;s grandfather.</p>
<p>He also blamed Trump for the lockdowns, but, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/06/after-testing-the-waters-the-blind-pig-to-hold-off-on-more-live-shows-in-ann-arbor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to MLive</a>, had actually willingly closed the Blind Pig in June despite being allowed to stay open.</p>

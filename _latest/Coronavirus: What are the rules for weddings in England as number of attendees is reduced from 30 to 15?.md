The aim of the new rules was to stop a second wave of coronavirus, following a rise in cases across the country.</p><p>But there were certain settings that were exempt from this &#8220;rule of six&#8221;, one being wedding ceremonies, which were still permitted to have 30 people present.</p><p></p><p>On 21 September, it was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-uk-cases-new-infections-second-wave-lockdown-b513963.html">reported</a> that cases of <a href="/topic/covid">Covid</a>-19 in England had risen by 4,368 in 24 hours, following a steady increase in recent days.</p><p id="article-im-prompt"></p><p>On Tuesday 22 September, <a href="/topic/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> addressed the nation again to introduce new restrictions.

So we are simplifying and strengthening the rules on social contact &#8211; making them easier to understand and for the police to enforce.</p><p>&#8220;It is absolutely critical that people now abide by these rules and remember the basics &#8211; washing your hands, covering your face, keeping space from others, and getting a test if you have symptoms.&#8221;</p><p>Anyone caught socialising in groups larger than six in England will be fined.

Amazon Prime Day 2020 is right around the corner. The two-day sales event will begin on October 13 and run through October 14, offering tons of deals on various products, including speakers of all shapes and sizes.

From soundbars and home theater systems, to smart speakers and Bluetooth speakers, we expect deals across all categories to suit different buying needs. Last year's sale featured big discounts on audio products from Sonos and Samsung, as well as Amazon's own lineup of Echo speakers.

A similar assortment of speaker deals is anticipated for this year's event. With that in mind, we've highlighted some speakers that will likely be on sale for Prime Day 2020, along with details on current pricing and early discounts you can take advantage of right now.

Early Prime Day speaker deals

Though Prime Day doesn't officially kick off until next week, Amazon is already offering a few early deals and promotions, including a special $20 discount when you preorder two brand-new fourth-generation Echo Dot speakers. You can also currently snag a certified refurbished Echo Plus for just $60. Brand-new models typically retail for $150.

When is Prime Day?

Amazon Prime Day 2020 will be begin on October 13 and will run through October 14. Sales on various speaker models are expected to be available across both days, so check back for a full rundown of deals when the event begins.

What Prime Day speaker deals to expect

Prime Day 2020 is likely to include big discounts on a variety of speakers from several different brands. Though we don't know exactly what deals will be offered this year, we can get a solid idea of what to expect based on last year's discounts.

Last year's event featured deals on speakers from brands like Sonos, Samsung, Bose, Vizio, Q Acoustics, and more. Amazon also offered discounts on its own lineup of Echo speakers. Soundbars, home theater systems, Bluetooth speakers, bookshelf speakers, and smart speakers were all on sale, and we anticipate that all of these speaker types will be accounted for during Prime Day 2020 as well.

Echo speakers, in particular, could see some solid price drops. Amazon will be releasing its brand-new fourth-generation lineup of Echos and Echo Dots at the end of October, so Prime Day could be a perfect opportunity for the retailer to clear out stock of older models.

There have also been some notable new speaker releases from big brands since the last Prime Day event, including the Sonos Move, Sonos Arc, and Bose Portable Home speaker. Deals on these newer models or other audio products that weren't available last year are a possibility.

Smart speaker deals we saw last year

Smart speakers offer buyers a convenient way to listen to music, control other devices, and find information from the web through simple voice commands. On Prime Day last year, Amazon's Echo smart speakers with the Alexa digital assistant received big discounts.

The second-generation Echo was on sale for $50, while the third-generation Echo Dot was on sale for just $22, and the Echo Plus was available for $110. Similar deals on other Echo smart speakers are likely for Prime Day 2020.

Bluetooth speaker deals we saw last year

Bluetooth speakers make it easy to listen to wireless music at home or outside. Many of them are portable with integrated batteries, and some models are even water-resistant.

During last year's Prime Day, the Bose SoundLink II was on sale for $89. Discounts on this model or similar Bluetooth speakers are possible for Prime Day 2020.

Soundbar deals we saw last year

Soundbars can offer a sizeable upgrade over the tiny integrated speakers used on most TVs, while still saving you some cash and space compared to a larger home theater system. Some soundbar models feature wireless subwoofers, and more advanced packages even include satellite speakers for surround sound.

During last year's Prime Day event, Samsung's MM45 2.1-channel soundbar was on sale for $120 off its regular price. That particular model is no longer available, but it's likely that Amazon will offer a similar deal on one of Samsung's newer 2.1-channel soundbars models, like the HW-T450. In fact, the HW-T450 is already $32 off its regular price right now.

Vizio's SB3220n-F6 was also on sale during Prime Day last year, with a discount of $27 off its regular price. That model is no longer available, but the smaller SB2920 is $25 off its regular price right now. Meanwhile, the Sonos Beam was available for $359 on last year's Prime Day, along with $100 worth of gift cards as part of a special promotion. We expect deals on more Vizio soundbars, Sonos speakers, and similar models from other companies on Prime Day 2020.

Home theater speaker deals we saw last year

If you're looking for truly immersive audio performance when watching movies, playing games, or listening to music, it's worth investing in a genuine home theater speaker setup. Home theater speaker setups can take the form of a simple pair of stereo bookshelf speakers, or a full surround sound system with five or more speakers.

For Prime Day last year, the Q Acoustics 3020i bookshelf speakers were available for $255, so it's possible that Amazon will offer another discount this year on similar speakers.

How to shop for a speaker

Choosing exactly which speaker is right for your needs can be tricky. Different speaker types vary wildly in price and size, so certain models are better suited for specific buyers.

If you want a compact speaker to take outside or use on trips, then a portable Bluetooth speaker is probably your best bet. If you're looking to upgrade your TV-watching experience, then a full home theater system or a soundbar will be a better fit. If you want to add a digital assistant to your household, then you should look into buying a smart speaker. Finally, if you simply want a good pair of stereo speakers for your desk at home or work, then consider buying a set of computer speakers.

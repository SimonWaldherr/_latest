Sharon Stone was a struggling actress in the early 1990s. So when the part of sizzling hot Catherine Tramell in the 1992 film Basic Instinct was being cast, the former model decided to push hard for the role.

That is why she posed nude for Playboy magazine, the 62-year-old icon told Drew Barrymore on her talk show Wednesday.

The mother-of-three also shared that she is done with dating for now in a sprawling interview.

Smart move: Sharon Stone was a struggling actress in the early 1990s. So when the part of sizzling hot Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct was being cast, the former model decided to push hard for the role

Calculated: That is why she posed nude for Playboy magazine, the 62-year-old icon told Drew Barrymore on her talk show Wednesday

When Sharon said she was not wild in her youth but rather 'strategic,' she offered an example.

'I decided I was going to do a Playboy article specifically because I wanted to get this film Basic Instinct,' said the blonde via satellite as she wore a patterned top and maroon boots while in her Beverly Hills home.

'I didn’t realize what would happen when I did the film,' the siren said of the fame the racy thriller brought.

She knew how to make an impression: The blonde posed nude for the July 1990 issue of Playboy magazine

It worked: Soon after the blonde bombshell won the role of Catherine Tramell in the 1992 movie with Michael Douglas

'I did think it was the right part for me and I knew what I had to do to get it. I didn’t have enough perspective to realize what was going to happen.'

What happened as she was labeled a sex symbol and her fans became infatuated with her character.

That fame allowed her to do several high-profile films such as Casino with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. She also starred in a Basic Instinct sequel in 2006.

How it went down: When Sharon said she was not wild in her youth but rather 'strategic,' she offered an example. 'I decided I was going to do a Playboy article specifically because I wanted to get this film Basic Instinct,' said the star

A lot to take in: 'I didn’t realize what would happen when I did the film,' the siren said of the fame the racy thriller brought

The shift: 'I did think it was the right part for me and I knew what I had to do to get it. I didn’t have enough perspective to realize what was going to happen,' Stone added

The star also told Drew that she is done with dating. 'I’m done dating. I’ve had it with dating.'

When Drew said 'I feel the same way' and asked why she has chosen to stay away from romance, Sharon said: 'Because I just find people to be insincere and not worth my time. I enjoy my alone time and my time with my kids and friends more.

'I just feel like I don’t need another kid, I don’t want any insincerity and bologna and game planning. I don’t know how to say this in a way that is politically correct.'

Drew told the Pennsylvania native to go for it.

No men thanks: The star also told Drew that she is done with dating. 'I’m done dating. I’ve had it with dating.' When Drew said 'I feel the same way' and asked why she has chosen to stay away from romance, Sharon said: 'Because I just find people to be insincere and not worth my time'

Not her thing: 'I just feel like I don’t need another kid, I don’t want any insincerity and bologna and game planning. I don’t know how to say this in a way that is politically correct,' she added

All ears: 'I don’t feel like men are at the same place women are right now. I have really good men friends but I just feel when it comes to emotional maturity in relationship that men and women are seemingly in different spots,' she said to Drew

'I don’t feel like men are at the same place women are right now. I have really good men friends but I just feel when it comes to emotional maturity in relationship that men and women are seemingly in different spots,' she said.

Barrymore asked if Stone is trying hard to make her sons more aware of this. The Hollywood veteran has three boys - Roan Joseph Bronstein, 20, Laird Vonne Stone, 15, and Quinn Kelly Stone, 14.

'Yes and they’ll come into my room the three of them together and they’ll start up some kind of guy conversation and I’ll be standing there and they’ll go, "We shouldn’t be doing this in front of mom." And I say, "You shouldn’t be doing this in front of each other." Let’s talk about it, why are we having this conversation anyway?' she said.

Behind the scenes of her interview: Stone was also seen with one of her sogs

A role model: Barrymore asked if Stone is trying hard to make her three sons more aware of this. 'Yes and they’ll come into my room the three of them together and they’ll start up some kind of guy conversation and I’ll be standing there and they’ll go, "We shouldn’t be doing this in front of mom." And I say, "You shouldn’t be doing this in front of each other"'

There are certain fears that boys and men have in the world today because there are certain misunderstandings about power and what it means to be masculine, said the actress.

'So I am trying to teach my boys that the ideas that men have passed on of what it means to be powerful and important might not be wholey correct and might not ultimately benefit them even in relationship to each other, so they can be more successful in the future and get things they want in their life, happy and healthy relationship, success in business. Just joy in their life.'

Stone was also asked about how she stays so young looking.

Her little ones: The Hollywood veteran has three sons - Roan Joseph Bronstein, 20, Laird Vonne Stone, 15, and Quinn Kelly Stone, 14

'I think as we get older we have to negotiate with mother nature and with time….As we get older there are things we should and should not do to our body. I think there are certain things that are fun when we are young and damaging when we get older.

Drew said she 'literally treated my body like a compost and not the natural kind' and wonders what that will do to her.

'I think the thing is as we get older we have to say debauchery is not great for a growing older body and when I got to be 40 I thought, "Oh look I am going to get older. So how do I want to get older? I’d like to get older like a dancer."

'I always thought the women who were dancers aged so beautifully and they had great posture and they moved beautifully, and they still could move. I thought I have to behave more like a dancer and I am going to have to eat better. I am thoughtful about what I put in my body and the way I treat my body so I get to keep it.'

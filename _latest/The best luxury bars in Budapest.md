(CNN) — Budapest's craft cocktail movement has seen new bars and clubs spread across town like wildfire in recent years, making it that much harder to choose the best of the bunch.

While the Hungarian capital's ruin bars offer a unique experience, the luxury bar scene here is second to none.

Whether you're looking to sample handcrafted cocktails or the finest Tokaji wines, there are a multitude of glamorous bars to choose from, complete with sharply dressed staff and/or top-notch mixologists.

From the High Note Skybar to Blue Fox The Bar at Kempinski, here's a run down of the finest luxury bars in Budapest

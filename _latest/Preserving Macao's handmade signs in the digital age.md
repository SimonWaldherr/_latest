"When I was a student, other classmates would ask me to write characters for them, because they liked the look of my handwriting. When I got older, people told me that I should open my own business."</p><p id="ad_rect_btf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Lam's signs advertise doctors' offices and grocery stores, real estate agencies and apartment buildings.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">But Lam says business has been slow lately, because shopkeepers across Macao are opting for cheaper, digitally-produced signs over his traditional ones.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"In the digital age, many people don't need you to write for them," Lam says. "I've received fewer customers."</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">But technology hasn't spelled total doom for Lam's typography business. In 2014, a chance meeting led Lam to local typeface designer, Benny Tang Pou I, a long-time fan of his work. Tang's award-winning work includes fonts that emulate birds in flight and the cobblestoned streets of Macao.</p><p class="HTMLEmbed__component"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Together, the two decided to digitize Lam's handwriting, with every stroke in every character replicated on Tang's computer and immortalized as a typeface. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"I would say that handwritten signs, like Mr. Lam's, convey more emotion and humanness," the 38-year-old says. "A digitally-produced sign feels lifeless."</p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191122124759-macao-typeface-4.jpg" alt="Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam."><p class="BasicArticle__caption">Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam.  <p class="BasicArticle__credit">Credit: </p><p class="BasicArticle__credit">Dan Tham/CNN</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Tang scans the characters onto his computer and then adjusts the shape of the strokes to create more uniformity. So far, he's digitized around 300 of Lam's Chinese characters, a process that took six months. He aims to convert up to 13,000 by the end of the project, which could take more than five years.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">On a stroll near the Ruins of St. Paul's, Lam and Tang point out the signage that carries Lam's trademark style. Pausing in front of a barber shop, the two are greeted by the storeowner. They explain that Lam had written his storefront sign. The three men step back and admire his handiwork.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">For Tang, these kinds of traditional signs do more than convey information to passersby. They can help to define a city's aesthetic and cultural identity.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"Certain things here (in Macao) are slowly fading away," Tang says, "Like Mr. Lam's signs. If we don't take action to preserve his font now, there might not be an opportunity in the future."</p></div>

Four states are now bracing for possible tornadoes after Hurricane Delta struck Louisiana Friday evening, wiping out power to 700,000 homes across Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

Delta, now a tropical depression, made landfall at winds of around 100 miles per hour near Creole Friday evening before heading inland to Lake Charles, striking the same areas still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.

Almost 11 million people found themselves caught up in Delta's pathway as it hammered the Louisiana coastline downing power lines, flooding roads and sending thousands of residents fleeing to emergency shelters.

Louisiana Governor Bel Edwards warned residents to 'stay vigilant' over the weekend as 2,500 National Guard troops were drafted in to hard-hit areas and the National Weather Service said the storm will 'continue to impact portions of the Gulf Coast with storm surge, heavy rainfall, flooding, and dangerous winds as it advances northward'.

The National Hurricane Center downgraded Delta to a tropical depression Saturday morning, as it continued to weaken as it made its way over Mississippi.

Delta started as a deadly Category 3 hurricane before being downgraded to a Category 2 Friday afternoon soon before it made landfall.

It then weakened to a Category 1 and then a tropical storm before becoming a tropical depression around 11 a.m. ET.

Despite the downgrade, forecasters warned more destruction is on its way with as much as 10 inches of rainfall expected in some areas in Arkansas and Mississippi stoking fears of more flash floods

'These rainfall amounts will lead to flash, urban, small stream, and minor river flooding,' the National Hurricane Center warned.

'There is a potential for 3 to 6 inches in the Southern to Central Appalachians, which could lead to flash, urban, small stream, along with isolated minor river flooding.'

Tornadoes pose another risk in Alabama, the Florida Panhandle and Georgia as Delta makes its pathway across northeastern Louisiana before reaching northern Mississippi and the Tennessee Valley later Saturday night and Sunday.

More than 700,000 power outages were reported across three states Saturday morning, including more than 586,600 in Louisiana, 103,598 in Texas and 67,873 in Mississippi.

Power outages in Louisiana and Texas had already soared past 410,000 homes and businesses Friday night hours of the storm coming ashore.

Louisiana Governor Bel Edwards urged residents to stay safe Saturday morning as, while the state may well be over the worst of the storm, its impact will pose a danger for some time.

'Delta has left hazards like flooded roads, downed power lines and displaced wildlife in our communities that no one should take lightly,' he tweeted.

'Everyone needs to remain vigilant, continue to listen to local officials and be safe.'

No deaths have been reported in the state from the hurricane, however officials warned that only seven of the 32 deaths from Hurricane Laura in Louisiana and Texas happened on the day of the hurricane.

Many deaths came about as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from emergency generators used due to power outages.

A Lake Charles Sheriff also warned residents the community was not out of the woods yet as it rising floodwaters have overturned vehicles on Interstate-10 westbound.

Sheriff Tony Mancuso of Calcasieu Parish told KPLC-TV early Saturday the situation remains 'dangerous' and urged evacuees not to return unless necessary.

Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, made the record books when it struck the Gulf Coast.

As well as heavy flooding, the hurricane turned tropical depression downed power lines and sent thousands of residents fleeing to emergency shelters Friday

It was the first Greek-alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental US and the 10th named storm to hit the mainland US this year, breaking a century-old record set in 1916.

It was also the fourth named storm to strike Louisiana in 2020. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip just three days before Laura struck.

And Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.

Some who rode out Laura chose to hunker down again with Delta. In Lafayette, about 75 miles east of Lake Charles, Jeanne-Marie Gove could hear debris hitting the front door of her apartment Friday night and her patio gate banging open and shut.

'The wind is much worse than what Hurricane Laura brought,' Gove said in a message on Twitter.

The roof from a trailer at the mobile home park behind her apartment was torn off and being tossed down the sidewalk.

Roughly 92 per cent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut down Friday night as Hurricane Delta battered the Gulf Coast - bringing the oil industry in the area to a standstill.

The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said seven rigs and 274 platforms had to be evacuated as Delta hit the southwestern coast of Louisiana.

Some 62 per cent of natural gas production were also shut down at the Gulf.

Delta crashed onshore Friday night about 15 miles from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana and five in Texas.

It hit with top winds of 100 mph but rapidly grew weaker. Within two hours of hitting land, it had dwindled to a Category 1 storm with 85 mph (140 kph) winds.

Still, forecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge that could reach up to 11 feet (3.4 meters).

Flash flood warnings were posted for much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.

Delta's reach stretched as far west as Galveston, Texas, about 100 miles from where the storm struck Louisiana.

Two homes under construction were toppled by winds, as were some trees and signs in the area.

Beach dunes flattened by earlier storms allowed storm surge to reach beneath some of Galveston's raised beach houses.

During the day Friday five million people braced for flash flooding and thousands were placed under mandatory evacuation orders in communities including Cameron Parish and Calcasieu Parish, while the Louisiana National Guard set up shelters to take in displaced residents.

Governor Bel Edwards said at a news conference Friday afternoon almost 10,000 residents had moved to emergency shelters with most evacuees coming from Calcasieu Parish.

Trump tweeted late Friday morning that the storm was on its way and FEMA was 'there and ready'

A curfew was issued for all residents in the Lafayette Parish area from 5 p.m. ET Friday through to 9 a.m. Saturday as officials warned people to prepare to hunker down in their homes.

By 4 p.m., with the storm still hours from landfall, almost 20,000 people were already without power and fears were mounting that many could be at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as they turn to using generators.

In New Orleans, which is expected to escape the worst of the storm, City employees were told they would be dismissed early from work Friday to ensure they were out of harm's way as gusty winds started pummeling the city early afternoon as well as over in Galveston Texas.

Donald Trump tweeted late Friday morning that the storm was on its way and the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been drafted in to support residents in Louisiana and Mississippi as the two states received a federal emergency declaration.

'Just got a briefing on Hurricane Delta rushing toward Louisiana and Mississippi. @fema is there and ready!!!' the president tweeted.

Delta first lashed the Caribbean coast of Mexico on Wednesday, when it made landfall around 5:30 a.m. with top winds of 110 mph.

Officials reported no deaths or injuries but hundreds of tourists were forced to take refuge in storm shelters after it struck just south of the popular Mexican holiday resort of Cancun.

Around 266,000 customers - one-third of residents - on the Yucatan peninsula were left without power, trees were toppled along the coast and stores were damaged.

Delta weakened to a Category 1 storm later that afternoon, before strengthening again as it moved over the southern Gulf, rising to maximum sustained winds of 90 mph by Wednesday night.

Throughout Thursday, Delta gained strength becoming a Category 3 storm as it headed across the open waters of the Gulf toward the US.

As Delta churned north at 12mph Friday morning, the National Hurricane Center had a hurricane warning in place for the Gulf Coast extending from High Island, Texas, to Morgan City.

Shortly after dawn, the first tropical storm-force winds were reaching the coast, even as the eye of the hurricane was about 160 miles south of Cameron.

Rivers were already full and local street flooding was reported from the coast to Baton Rouge inland, while tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain battered parts of the Louisiana and Texas coasts by midday.

Delta made landfall at the very same areas ravaged by Hurricane Laura just six weeks ago.

Debris still on the ground from the last storm makes the situation more perilous as it will become potential projectiles damaging already weakened structures in the area.

Louisiana received a federal emergency declaration with Governor John Bel Edwards warning 'we've got people who are very tired' from the last freak weather event.

Walmart said it was closing many of its stores across the Gulf Coast as a precaution while energy companies halted 92 percent, or nearly 1.7 million barrels per day of offshore oil output, and 62 percent of natural gas production.

The US Coast Guard closed ports from Beaumont, Texas, to Lake Charles ahead of the storm.

People in this battered coastal region were taking Delta seriously.

'You can always get another house another car but not another life,' said Hilton Stroder as he and his wife Terry boarded up their Abbeville home with plans to head to their son's house further east.

'People of Lake Charles and in Cameron Parish have already suffered enough, and then here comes this one,' said Desi Milligan, who owns an RV park in Cameron that was heavily damaged by Laura.

In Abbeville, Tony Russo said 2020 had 'been a hell of a year' as he stockpiled groceries Thursday.

'I don't know really any different,' he said when asked his reaction to the busy storm season. 'You're here. If you love it you stay,' he said.

This comes after Laura demolished much of the southwestern part of the state on August 27, causing more than 30 deaths.

Reminders of Laura were already everywhere in the region.

In nearby Bell City, some debris piles are more than 6 feet high and 75 feet ( long.

Though homes and farmhouses in the area still stood, blue tarms covered many rooftops with lingering damage from Laura.

In Cameron Parish, power poles along Highway 27 in a desolate stretch of marsh were all either broken or leaning - none appeared to have been repaired since the August storm.

A few miles down the road, Creole presented a scene of utter devastation under an overcast sky that soon gave way to pouring rain.

Where there used to be buildings, exposed slabs remained. A church and a convenience store had been reduced to debris, and fences were blown over or completely torn down.

New Orleans, well east of the projected landfall area, was expected to escape Delta's worst impacts.

But tropical storm force winds were still likely in the city on Friday, and local officials said they were preparing for the possibility of tornadoes.

And in Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency like his counterpart Edwards did in Louisiana.

Forecasters said southern Mississippi could see heavy rain and flash flooding.

<p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/brian-ortega">Brian Ortega</a> made a triumphant return to the octagon Saturday when he dominated Chan Sung Jung in the UFC on ESPN+ 38 headliner for his first victory in more than two years.</p>
<p>Ortega (15-1 MMA, 7-1 UFC) put on a measured and precise performance over the course of five rounds against Jung (16-6 MMA, 6-3 UFC) to pick up a clean sweep of 50-45 scorecards for <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/10/ufc-espn-plus-38-results-brian-ortega-dominant-decision-long-layoff-chan-sung-jung-korean-zombie">the unanimous decision</a> in the featherweight main event at Flash Forum at Yas Island in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Despite it being his first octagon appearance in nearly two years since <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2018/12/ufc-231-results-max-holloway-overwhelms-brian-ortega-defends-title">his title-fight loss</a> to Max Holloway in December 2018, Ortega&#8217;s statement effort appears to have put him next in line to challenge 145-pound champion <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/alexander-volkanovski">Alexander Volkanovski</a> (22-1 MMA, 9-0 UFC) for the belt.</p>
 
<p>Is that the logical fight, though? Watch the video above for thoughts and analysis on Ortega&#8217;s future after beating &#8220;The Korean Zombie&#8221; at UFC on ESPN+ 38.</p>

Bruno Fernandes has emphatically quashed talk that he became embroiled in an argument with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer during Manchester United's humiliating defeat against Tottenham.

The United midfielder was substituted at half-time at Old Trafford by Solskjaer with his side already 4-1 behind, before they went on to lose 6-1 in the Premier League.

It has been claimed that Fernandes was left raging with Solskjaer and questioned his tactics during the interval at Old Trafford, but the Portugal international has rubbished that notion - insisting it was an attempt to 'destabilise' the dressing room.

Bruno Fernandes has emphatically dismissed having a bust-up with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer

'There's been a lot of speculation about that,' Fernandes told Sport TV after Portugal's comfortable 3-0 win over Sweden in the Nations League on Wednesday.

'First it was a discussion with team-mates, as it did not stick, it was a discussion with only one team-mate [Victor Lindelof], as it did not stick now, it is the discussion with Solskjaer.

'I believe it is a way to destabilise the group. What was said is in no way true.

'I was replaced at half-time, it is true, by technical option. The coach told me that the game was almost over and that we would have a lot of games ahead of us. Got it. I was not satisfied but said nothing that could harm the group.'

The Old Trafford drubbing had left United in turmoil heading into the two-week international break.

Fernandes and his United team-mates will be desperate to bounce back against Newcastle

But the Red Devils will be desperate to put it right when they travel to Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday night.

'Do not use my name, my colleagues or the coach to make trouble at Manchester United,' he said.

'The atmosphere is good and the team is ready to give an answer in the next game [against Newcastle United].'

United have endured a horrid start to the new campaign, claiming just three points from as many matches, having lost to Tottenham and Crystal Palace while beating Brighton in controversial circumstances in between.

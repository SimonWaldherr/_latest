A long time ago in a galaxy, far, far away – well, Islington in 1982 – Leroy Logan (John Boyega) has a confession to make. “I want to join the Force,” the hero of Red, White and Blue sheepishly announces to a friend. “What?” the pal chuckles. “You’re gonna be a Jedi or something?”

Of course, Boyega himself ticked that one off his to-do list a while ago. The 28-year-old was a leading light in the latest Star Wars trilogy, in which he established himself as one of the most charismatic young actors around. As for Leroy, his actual ambition – to join the Metropolitan Police in an era when racial divisions were rife, and the force itself overwhelmingly white – isn’t too far removed from science-fiction itself.

History tells us things worked out in the long run. Logan retired from the Met in 2013 after rising to the rank of superintendent, and was awarded an MBE in 2001. But Steve McQueen’s brooding and muscular new film – one of five in his Small Axe anthology of stories from British West Indian life – is less concerned with the long arc of the moral universe than its treacherous foothills, where the course of events can be determined by a single scramble or slip.

A more conventional treatment of Logan’s story might have framed it as a triumph-over-adversity tale, perhaps ending with his investiture ceremony, at which our outsider hero is conclusively accepted by the British establishment. But with a cliche-busting flourish, McQueen and his co-writer Courttia Newland follow him for just a few years, and leave him – and us, for that matter – stranded at a point at which the actual value and impact of his efforts remain shrouded in doubt.

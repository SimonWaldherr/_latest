Boris Johnson will never defeat the coronavirus pandemic, Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said, and must instead start to help Britons learn to live with the disease.

The former Conservative leader told the Chopper Politics podcast (listen to it on the audio player above): "I've never been to a time like this where we have almost suspended all judgment on everything else as secondary to Covid.

"And the truth is that if we go on just trying to push these spikes down the whole time ... then we could be in this for years, because there are very few vaccines that have been completely effective against viruses."

Sir Iain said the focus on Covid meant other risks were being completely ignored. He added: "We've lost the balance of risks. We now have only one risk. And if you think of only one risk, then you can damage everything around you."

He said he thought the right course of action on coronavirus was "managing it but not expecting that, as people say, we can defeat this â€“ because I honestly don't think we will, actually."

Iain Duncan Smith is joined on this week's episode of Chopper's Politics by Best for Britain's chief executive, Naomi Smith, and comedian and author Michael Spicer, aka the Room Next Door man.

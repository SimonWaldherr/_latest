Can the EMA be replaced by founding the UK&#8217;s own life science bureau, connecting people and communities through the power of science in a new world? Could it be founded in the very borough that the EMA departed from?

Tower Hamlets would be the perfect place to replace the EMA, as it sits between two financial districts and brings together a breadth of skills, experience and talent from around the world.

<p>The champions are seeking further clarification after their initial Premier League briefing on why Everton keeper Jordan Pickford was not punished for his appalling tackle was later undermined by referees&#8217; head Mike Riley.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, a Liverpool representative spoke to a senior Premier League official and was informed that the video assistant referee, David Coote, did not check for a possible red card.</p>
<p>Coote was preoccupied with whether Van Dijk was in an offside position during the sixth-minute incident, so Liverpool were guided that, once the offside was established,&#160;the deliberations regarding the tackle went no further.</p>
<p>The Premier League confirmed that stance to the media when asked on Saturday evening. The Premier League&#8217;s information comes directly from Stockley Park, where Coote watched the game and offered an explanation for the contentious decisions.</p>
<p>However, since then, Liverpool have received further correspondence which contradicts the earlier messaging.</p>
<p>An email from Riley, managing director of the Professional Game and Match Officials Limited, stated that a check for a red card was made subsequent to the offside call.</p>
<p>That has prompted suspicions at Anfield that the refereeing body are protecting themselves after realising how serious the fall-out from Pickford&#8217;s challenge was - with Van Dijk suffering a cruciate knee injury which requires surgery.</p>
<p>The Football Association confirmed on Monday that Pickford would not be the subject of retrospective action because the incident was seen and dealt with at the time. That is line with usual procedures if referees say they saw an incident on matchday.</p>
<p>Formal processes are available for clubs seeking to complain or seek clarity on decisions taken, but Liverpool have written directly to the Premier League detailing the two narratives they have been presented with since the 2-2 draw, and querying how two different explanations have been offered.</p>

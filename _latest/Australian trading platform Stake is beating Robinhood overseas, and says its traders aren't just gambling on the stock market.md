<p>Stake, the Sydney-based commission-free broker, has been rapidly expanding during 2020 in a global land grab that has left Robinhood in its dust.</p>
<p>Having first introduced Australians to &#8216;free&#8217; share trading <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/aussie-company-stake-lets-you-trade-us-shares-from-your-phone-opening-up-wall-street-for-your-trading-side-hustle-2019-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2017</a>, founder and CEO Matt Leibowitz is cracking open the $US36 trillion American market for other countries that have been similarly locked out.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people think of the sharemarket, they think of Wall Street, and yet so many people around the world have been locked out of it. It&#8217;s actually ludicrous,&#8221; he told Business Insider Australia.</p>
<a href="https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/uploads/businessinsider/2020/10/Stake-Matt.jpg" rel="modal"><img src="https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/uploads/businessinsider/2020/10/Stake-Matt.jpg" class="size_primary" alt=""></a>Stake CEO and co-founder Matt Leibowitz.<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just been Australia either which is why it was always the plan to go overseas.&#8221;</p>
<p>In February, Stake launched in the UK, followed by New Zealand in March and just this week opened to customers in Brazil. Leibowitz says Europe is next.</p>
<h2> Stake is carving out a global market </h2>
<p>It is in many ways the role that Robinhood was meant to fulfil. Instead, it withdrew long-held plans for a UK launch earlier this year. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s Australian waitlist meanwhile, opened back in 2015, has since been removed, leaving would-be disciples left empty-handed, and its global aspirations apparently withering on the vine.</p>
<p>Stake, meanwhile, is flourishing, on the way to doubling its user base since <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/stake-australia-users-wall-street-volatility-expansion-2020-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hitting the 100,000 mark back in June</a>. </p>
<p>But while operating in the same space, Leibowitz says Stake and Robinhood aren&#8217;t offering the same thing, as Robinhood doubles down in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think their proposition is quite different and is about democratising the financial system in the US by making investing more affordable locally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whereas Stake is actually democratising access to that global market. It&#8217;s about being able to make your money work for you no matter where you live. We think you should have the same opportunity with the use of technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Far from critical, Leibowitz says he admires what Robinhood has been able to achieve and acknowledges there&#8217;s a debt of gratitude owed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve really carved an amazing understanding of this new age broker that&#8217;s possible and in a way that has actually created a great road for us to become the Robinhood for the rest of the world,&#8221; he said</p>
<h2> A different beast </h2>
<p>But it ultimately may be a different path to the one that Robinhood has cut for itself. </p>
<p>&#8216;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/robinhood-traders-impact-stock-market-prices-none-study-popularity-effect-2020-9?r=US&amp;IR=T" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Robinhood traders</a>&#8216; has become polite parlance for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/australian-day-trading-asx-coronavirus-volatility-asic-speculation-gambling-2020-5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">amateurs taking a punt in wildly swinging markets</a>. As markets briefly melted down in March before rebounding, there have been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/australian-investing-coronavirus-asx-money-funds-stocks-companies-2020-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">abundant opportunities</a> to make &#8211; or lose &#8211; a fortune in the space of a few hours.</p>
<p>It has been perpetuated by the rise of a subculture that revolves around infamous internet forums such as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/member-of-wallstreetbets-reddit-page-posts-14000-gain-two-trades-2019-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WallStreetBets</a>, which self-identifies as &#8216;Like 4Chan found a Bloomberg Terminal&#8217;, and its local counterpart, ASXBets, where users <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/reddit-user-100000-return-two-trades-taking-small-break-2019-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">celebrate and commiserate &#8216;bets&#8217;</a> in equal measure.</p>
<p>But Leibowitz maintains that Stake is attracting a more experienced demographic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re a bit savvier. 77% of them have a local brokerage account and they&#8217;re using Stake to get access to the US market and because they don&#8217;t want to be restricted in that way,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, they are people that want to take risk and grow their wealth in an active way, but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any one-size-fits-all when it comes to investing.&#8221;</p>

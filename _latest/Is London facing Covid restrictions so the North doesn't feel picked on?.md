This understanding has encouraged some – particularly Burnham in Manchester – to throw their weight about and to warn of the damage that will be done to their own areas thanks to the recent announcement of stricter measures in the north and Midlands than in southern parts of the country. What a relief, then, that this morning it was announced that the capital itself will, along with Essex, be plunged into “Tier 2” levels of restrictions from midnight tomorrow (Friday).

Not being a fan of conspiracy theories, I will refrain from suggesting that this move is unjustified, that London is being shunted into Tier 2 – the same level, at present, as Manchester – in order to make the North, with all their lovely recently-won “red wall” Conservative parliamentary seats, feel less like the spurned uncle at a family wedding, sitting on his own at a table in the corner. Still, it’s instructive that Khan, the London mayor, seemed unduly excited by the prospect of having Tier 2 imposed upon his city when he wrote to ministers earlier this week. His justification for such a move? That the infection rate in London is “fast approaching” 100 cases per 100,000 population.

Manchester, meanwhile – as is traditional – might be rightfully scornful of their soft southern cousins demanding the same measures that have been imposed there, given that the infection rate in Manchester is five times that of London: 477.5 per 100,000 as of yesterday.

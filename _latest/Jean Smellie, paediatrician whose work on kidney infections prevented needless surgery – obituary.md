Dr Jean Smellie, who has died aged 93, was a paediatrician who specialised in the management of children with urinary infection; her meticulous research was important in developing understanding of the condition, reducing the number of unnecessary investigations and operations to which children were subjected.

Having completed her training as a paediatrician in 1960, Jean was appointed to a part-time post at University College Hospital in London with a remit to look after children who had urinary infections. These are a common problem, usually mild and effectively treated with antibiotics, though some children develop pyelonephritis (severe kidney infection).

There was great interest in how best to investigate and manage such children, as a small number of cases are associated with kidney scarring leading to high blood pressure and even renal failure in later life. Some children had reflux of urine from their bladder back up into the kidney, and it was thought that this, with or without pyelonephritis, might be the reason for the damage occasionally seen.

So to identify which children were at risk of scarring of the kidney, young patients underwent intrusive investigations, often involving the insertion of a catheter, instillation of a radio opaque dye and X-rays.

When reflux was identified, surgery was advised and there was no shortage of surgeons willing to operate.

Meanwhile, between 1955 and 1975 almost 750 children attended Jean Smellie’s clinic to be evaluated. She and her colleagues found that a low dose of prophylactic antibiotics could reduce the number of urinary infections, and in a landmark paper in The Lancet in 1991, they reported the results of a randomised controlled trial showing no difference in outcome between those who had surgery for reflux and those treated with prophylactic antibiotics. This immediately reduced the numbers of children referred for surgery.

<div><p>The World Bank says richer countries, with the exception of Great Britain, are not stepping up to help poorer countries in the face of the pandemic.&#160;</p>
<p>The World Bank's managing director of operations, Axel van Trotsenburg, said that the contributions from higher-income governments have been "flat or declining", a marked difference from what happened during the 2009-2010 financial crisis.&#160;</p>
<p>"With the notable exception of the UK, which has been an absolute leader, the contributions by governments have been much more flat or declining," he told The Telegraph.&#160;</p>
<p>"We saw the greatest generosity ever... during the depths of the financial crisis. We need that again. We cannot think that we can solve the problem in OECD countries alone. If you leave the poor countries out, it will not solve this problem.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/coronavirus-set-trigger-brutal-tragedies-fragile-countries-un/">We have to look at the human face of this crisis</a>, then realise that it would be a very good investment indeed if we could continue supporting these countries during this difficult time," he added.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The UK, the world's sixth biggest economy in 2019, pledged $3.8bn to the world's poorest countries via the World Bank's International Development Asosciation (IDA), in April this year, eclipsing Japan, the United States and France.&#160;</p>
<p>The World Bank's financial reserves come from several sources - from funds raised in the financial markets, earnings on its investments, fees paid in by member countries, contributions made by members and from the&#160;borrowing countries themselves, when they pay back their loans.</p>
<p>However, the World Bank itself has also faced criticism for the speed of its response, with a paper from the US-based Center for Global Development (CGD) last week suggesting that the organisation is not responding quickly or dramatically enough to the scale of the crisis caused by Covid-19.&#160;</p>
<p>The World Bank has pledged up to $160bn to client countries,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/world-bank-releases-19bn-developing-countries-bid-fight-coronavirus/"> starting quickly in spring this year.&#160;</a> But CGD said that, for example, while lending has accelerated, with loan commitments up 118 per cent year on year, actual disbursements - payments of money to the countries themselves - has only increased by 31 per cent.&#160;</p>

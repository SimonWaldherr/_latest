French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that nightly curfews will be imposed in Paris and other major cities to try to curb the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic as a state of emergency is reimposed.

The curfews will take effect from Saturday, and will run daily from 9:00pm until 6:00am the following morning, Macron said in an interview broadcast on national television.

The curfews will remain in force for four weeks, he said, and anyone caught violating it will be fined €135.

The move to reinstate a state of health emergency that expired on July 10 will allow the government to enforce stricter measures in the future, either locally or nationally.

"We have to react," Mr Macron said. He said France had not lost control of the virus, but added: "We are in a worrying situation."

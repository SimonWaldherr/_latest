<div><p class="gnt_ar_by">Kristina Arriaga</p><p class="gnt_ar_pb">Opinion contributor</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">During my first week in college, a hallmate called me a slur for Spanish-speaking people.&#160;Because I learned English at an all-girls&#8217; Catholic school in Puerto Rico, I was not well-versed in racial slurs. In my culture, a nickname signals acceptance, like &#8220;Maverick&#8221; and &#8220;Goose&#8221; in "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Top Gun</a>." So, instead of being offended, I was pleased to have earned a &#8220;call sign&#8221; so quickly. I received the slur as a warm welcome.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Years later, as the young mother of three fair-skinned children, I wondered why fellow mothers at the neighborhood park seemed uncomfortable when I tried to join their discussions. I was finally enlightened when one asked to know which family I&#160;worked for.&#160;Later, at a friend&#8217;s pool party (a friend who happened to be a member of Congress), a fellow guest handed me her children&#8217;s towels, assuming I was&#160;staff.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">My professional life has been peppered with similar incidents. Although I speak four languages and earned a master&#8217;s degree from a prestigious university, more than a few colleagues have conflated speaking with an accent with speaking out of turn. Or worse. When I was <a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/about-uscirf/kristina-arriaga-de-bucholz-commissioner" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">appointed to represent</a> the United States&#160;before an international body, a colleague actually asked me who I was sleeping with, adding&#160;that, surely, that&#8217;s how I got appointed.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">"Free" expression in Cuba</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Since &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; is in vogue, many today would rally around my &#8220;right&#8221; to publicly shame my offenders.

I then walked down the hallway, knocked on my hallmate&#8217;s door and explained how it felt. She was embarrassed, sharing she was the first in her family to go to college. I can&#8217;t say we became close friends.

Indelible and provocative, each image is evidence of the need for conversation.

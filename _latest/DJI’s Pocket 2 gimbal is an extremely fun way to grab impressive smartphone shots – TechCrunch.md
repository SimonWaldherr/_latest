<div><p class="p2">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/djis-clever-little-pocket-gimbal-gets-refreshed-with-improved-video/">Pocket 2</a> is the kind of device that makes me wish I got out a bit more. I&#8217;ve been testing it out for a few days, and, while it&#8217;s done a reasonably good job making my life look a bit more interesting, there&#8217;s only so much such a little device can do during this lockdown. That&#8217;s no fault of DJI&#8217;s of course. There&#8217;s only so much that can be done &#8212; and at the end of the day, a camera can only really work with the content you give it.</p>
<p class="p2">Even so, I&#8217;ve enjoyed my time with the product. As I did with its predecessor, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dji" target="_blank">DJI </a> Osmo Pocket. The device returns this week with a truncated name and a handful of improvements. Nothing on board is particularly revolutionary, but the original device was such a cool and innovative product when it first arrived roughly two years ago, the company can be forgiven for mostly focusing on refinement.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"></p><img class="size-full wp-image-2062860" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-054831506.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p class="p2">The line builds on DJI&#8217;s know-how, developed with years of drone imaging and gimbal expertise. Unlike, say the Ronin or <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/osmo" target="_blank">Osmo </a> Mobile lines, however, the product works as a standalone, with a small built-in display that records directly onto a microSD card. But as with the original, the whole getup works a heck of a lot better when you&#8217;ve got an Android or iOS handset to work with. The Pocket still does the majority of the heavy imaging lifting, but your phone just works as a much better preview screen and control center than the measly one built into the device.</p>
<p class="p2">The system ships with a pair of connectors: USB-C and Lightning, depending on your device. It&#8217;s a solid setup, best controlled with two hands. I didn&#8217;t have any issues, but I don&#8217;t entirely trust the integrity of a connector enough to hold it with one. Better yet, there are wireless accessories that allow for you to control the system remotely via phone. And speaking of accessories, I highly recommend getting a mini tripod or splurging for the bonus pack that includes one. It can be tricky propping the system up correctly for those modes that require minutes-long record times. More than once a video ended when the device fell over due to a strong gust.</p>
<p></p><img class="wp-image-2062870 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-19-054912488.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="3000"><p class="p2">The underlying imaging hardware has been improved throughout. The camera now sports a larger sensor (64-megapixels) and wider lens, shooting better videos and stills than the original. The device can zoom up to 8x &#8212; though I&#8217;d recommend sticking with the 4x lossless optical, so as to not degrade those shots you&#8217;re taking. (HDR, incidentally, is coming at a later date.)</p>
<p class="p2">The mics, too, have been upgraded. There are four in total on board. Definitely use that optional wind noise reduction. For even better quality, the combo pack also includes a wireless microphone with windscreen, so that, too, may be worth investigating depending on what and where you plan to shoot. The three-axis gimbal does a good job keep things steady &#8212; and moves smoothly for a variety of different image and video capturing tasks. As with the last version, I found the battery to be lacking &#8212; that&#8217;s doubly the case for the gimbal charging up an attached phone by default.</p>
<p class="p2">As usual, the shooting modes are the real secret sauce. In particular, I&#8217;m really smitten with timelapse and hyperlapse. The former offers a sped-up image, using the gimbal to stabilize the shot as you move:</p>
<p></p><img class="size-full wp-image-2062861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-4-f0695a71734c.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338"><p class="p2">Hyperlapse takes it a step further, mechanically moving the gimbal from left to right in slow increments that give a sweeping shot of a space over time:</p>
<p></p><img class="size-full wp-image-2062864" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ezgif-4-9abf7e0fd860.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338"><p class="p2">The system also borrows subject tracking from the drone line. Draw a rectangular around an object on the smartphone display and the gimbal will move along with it. The tracking proved to be pretty accurate, though I ran into some issues in the shadows and in situations when there&#8217;s a lot of divergent movement happening &#8212; like when I attempted to capture the runner in a softball game. On the whole however, it does a pretty solid job with people and animals alike.</p>
<p class="p2">The gimbal is also great for stitching together panorama shots &#8212; something that can be a pain on a standard smartphone. It can either do together a standard ultra wide 180-degree shot or create a highly detailed 3&#215;3 image by essentially stitching together nine images in one:</p>

It&#8217;s essentially a $349 add-on designed to augment smartphone photography. It&#8217;s an easy shortcut for grabbing some really cool shots, but pros are going to be much more interested in shooting with, say, a Ronin and an SLR. That leaves hobbyists with cash to spend on something that will, say, really wow their friends on social media. It&#8217;s a way to capture some drone-style shots without ever having to leave the ground.</p>

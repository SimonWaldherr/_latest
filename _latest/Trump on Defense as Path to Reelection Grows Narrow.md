The best offense may be an aggressive defense for President Donald Trump as he struggles in the polls less than three weeks before Election Day.

Or, it may be his only option as he scrambles to hang onto states he won easily in 2016 but which now are in play as Democrat Joe Biden challenges the president in a widening array of battlegrounds.

Trump headed Wednesday to a rally in Iowa, a state he won by more than 9 percentage points in 2016 – a greater margin than his win in Texas. The president and allied groups have reportedly spent $24.5 million on the airwaves in Georgia, a state a Republican presidential candidate should be able to win just by appearing on the ballot.

In September and October, Trump's travel has been almost entirely to states he won in 2016 – including some he won easily. He's been not only to the predicted battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida, but North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Ohio. The only potential pickup states Trump has visited are Nevada and Minnesota – both considered long shots for the president.

Biden, meanwhile, is using his cash advantage to throw out the net even further: He's clocking a lot of time in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – states that would ensure him the presidency if he won them along with the states Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in 2016 – but has campaigned in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Arizona. Texas, Georgia, Iowa, Maine and even Nebraska – where Biden has a shot at picking up a delegate through the state's unusual Electoral College vote distribution system – have gotten visits from vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris; Biden's wife, Jill Biden; and Harris's husband, Doug Emhoff. Harris is scheduled to go to North Carolina on Thursday.

At a time when general election candidates would typically be focusing their precious remaining resources on a small number of battlegrounds, the former vice president is reportedly spending more than $24 million this week on ads in Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and Texas.

"It's a bad sign when it's the final three weeks of the campaign and you're having to work really hard to defend the states where you won, which should be almost automatic," says Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz.

As for the Iowa visit, "I think it signals that what we're seeing in public polling reflects what they are probably seeing in internal polling," says Andrew Green, author of the book "From the Iowa Caucuses to the White House: Understanding Donald Trump's 2016 Electoral Victory in Iowa."

"States they felt relatively comfortable about six months ago are now in play. They want to make sure they can count on those Electoral College votes," even if Iowa offers only six such votes, adds Green, a professor at Central College in Pella, Iowa.

Even if some of the states are still aspirational for Biden, the Trump campaign has to redirect time and money to make sure those states don't slip away, he adds. "Any resources that they have to use to hold states like Georgia and Texas and Iowa and Ohio are resources they can't put into winning the states that are really crucial" to reelection, Abramowitz says.

Trump faces a daunting Electoral College map in his reelection bid. He is trailing in polls by mid-to-high single digits in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three states he won by less than a percentage point in 2016. He could win the election if he loses Michigan and Wisconsin, but hangs onto Pennsylvania or if he loses Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but holds Michigan. That's a challenge already and would require Trump to win every other state he took in 2016.

But now, Trump must also fight to keep states where a loss would not only deprive him reelection but could result in a landslide win for Biden if there is a big blue wave. Trump is behind in polls in Arizona, slightly behind or tied in Florida and North Carolina, and in virtual dead heats with Biden in Ohio, Iowa, Georgia and Texas. Trump's one-time pickup chances – Minnesota and New Hampshire – now appear out of reach. A Suffolk University poll released Wednesday showed the president 10 percentage points behind Biden in the Granite State.

Instead of seeking to expand his base, the president is doubling down on messages aimed at the constituencies which elected him in 2016. He repeatedly downplays the severity of the COVID-19 threat, for example, and warns of the decline of "law and order" should Democrats take over the White House.

In a particularly revealing moment, Trump on Tuesday night pleaded with suburban women to back him, as they did four years ago.

"Suburban women, will you please like me? Please please. I saved your damned neighborhood, OK?" Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania, where polls show suburban women abandoning the president. "The other thing – I don't have much time to be nice. You know I can do it, but I gotta go quickly."

Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, says it makes sense for Trump to visit Iowa. "You have to pick up the pace and shore up your base," Hagle says, noting that there had been some grumbling in Iowa that the president wasn't spending time there.

Still, "it doesn't appear that he's going to win Iowa by 9 points this time. It does seem close. We just never know," Hagle adds.

A bipartisan deal on more coronavirus relief looked more promising Friday after President Donald Trump shifted back to rallying behind an agreement and raised his counteroffer to $1.8 trillion, though support still appears uncertain just weeks out from the 2020 election.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been negotiating for weeks after talks stalled in early August, but those conversations were threatened on Tuesday when Trump said he was pulling the plug on a relief package and shifting gears fully to the Supreme Court confirmation fight. Since then, Trump has changed gears – numerous times – over the past week, first pushing for a few stand-alone measures, then going back to a larger coronavirus relief bill.

Trump is preparing a $1.8 trillion offer, coming up about $200 billion from the GOP's last one. Yet before Democrats reacted or talked through the new proposal, the president has already indicated that he would go higher than what either party is currently offering. Democrats, who had come down to $3.4 trillion, again lowered their offer to $2.2 trillion. Talks between Pelosi and Mnuchin will resume on Friday.

"I would like to see a bigger stimulus package, frankly, than either the Democrats or Republicans are offering," Trump said Friday afternoon on conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh's show. He tweeted earlier in the day that COVID-19 relief negotiators should "go big."

The latest White House offer brings the two parties closer than they have been in weeks, now only separated by $400 billion. But during negotiations, Pelosi has said that differences remain not only on price tag but also on legislative language as well as disagreements on certain provisions like state and local aid and federal unemployment benefits. Negotiators have signaled that there's likely common ground on a second round of direct payments and aid for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. And both sides have expressed support for providing relief for the airline industry which has furloughed and laid off tens of thousands of workers.

During a Friday interview on MSNBC, Pelosi struck an optimistic tone that a deal could come together in the near future, though she noted that the president has wavered on his desire to have negotiators strike an agreement.

"I do hope that we will have an agreement soon, but as you say, they keep changing. We thought we were on a path and then the president with no notice to Congress – I think bewildering some of his own people – then made his tweet saying talks are over because I want the focus strictly to be on confirming my Supreme Court nominee," Pelosi said prior to the new offer from the White House. "He got a terrible backlash from it, including in the stock market … and so then he started to come back little by little and now a bigger package."

To be sure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has expressed doubt that a bipartisan deal will materialize and be signed into law before the Nov. 3 election. McConnell has not been involved in the latest round of negotiations and has said that parts of his conference are weary of more spending. A number of GOP senators have expressed concerns about a large price tag and have signaled that they won't support any relief packages that greatly exceed $1 trillion.

Since March, Congress has passed several coronavirus aid bills that have totaled more than $3 trillion. But there's been congressional inaction for months as the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. swells to 7.6 million and the death toll exceeds 213,000.

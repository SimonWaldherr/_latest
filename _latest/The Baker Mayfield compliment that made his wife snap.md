<div><p>Emily Mayfield has seen husband Baker take plenty of hits as the Browns quarterback, both on and off the field.</p>
 
<p>Following Sunday&#8217;s loss to AFC North rival Pittsburgh, in which an injured Mayfield was benched late in the third quarter, Emily responded to a post regarding the 25-year-old quarterback&#8217;s turbulent tenure in Cleveland.</p>
<p>&#8220;4 head coaches in 3 years, took over a 1-31 football team, and has the most wins at First Energy Stadium of any QB since 1999 in only 3 years. That&#8217;s my quarterback,&#8221; the post read, <a href="https://www.awesemo.com/sideaction/baker-mayfields-wife-responds-to-trolls-after-benching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Awesemo.com</a>.</p>
<p>Emily then replied, &#8220;He&#8217;s not in an easy position. And he&#8217;s grinding for this city. It takes time. Don&#8217;t send me some stupid s&#8211;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>While this is seemingly a compliment of Mayfield, it&#8217;s unclear if Emily received other messages trashing her husband&#8217;s performance Sunday.</p>
<p>Mayfield, whose dealing with bruised ribs, threw for 119 yards with one touchdown, two interceptions and was sacked four times in the 38-7 Steelers blowout.</p>
<p>The first overall pick in 2018, Mayfield began his NFL career under Hue Jackson, who was fired in October of that year. Gregg Williams was then named the interim head coach before Freddie Kitchens took the reins in 2019. Kitchens was fired after one season, with the Browns naming Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach in January.</p>
<p>Cleveland is off to a 4-2 start under Stefanski.</p>
 
<p>On Tuesday, Emily also shared a lengthy post cautioning fans to think twice before criticizing a player.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before critics and fans jump to conclusions after an injury, loss, etc. they should put themselves in the athletes&#8217; shoes&#8230; but let&#8217;s be honest, they never could because they aren&#8217;t part of the 1.6%, the best in the world,&#8221; the post read, to which Emily wrote, &#8220;Retweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emily has been married to Mayfield since July 2019.</p>

Sachs. </strong></p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Their view: "Let the pandemic run its course until most of the population is infected and has ostensibly developed antibodies to ward off future infections.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans could die or develop long-term complications from Covid and vulnerable populations would be at severe risk. "If a reliable and safe vaccine will soon be available to protect citizens, surely there is overwhelming reason not to become infected now, but rather to stay safe until the vaccine arrives," Sachs wrote.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Covid-19 has had a devastating effect on many big cities, "emptying normally bustling streets and haunting formerly crowded subways,"<strong> Fareed Zakaria</strong> wrote in an excerpt from his new book, "Ten Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World." </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"People sheltered in place or scattered to the suburbs.

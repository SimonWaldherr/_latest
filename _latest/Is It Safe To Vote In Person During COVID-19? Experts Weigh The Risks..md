As a result, long lines formed at the locations that remained open.</p><p>A<strong> </strong>follow-up study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July showed that those <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/honestly-just-vote-in-person-its-safer-than-you-think/" target="_blank">fears may have been unfounded</a>.</p><p>&#8220;No clear increase in cases, hospitalizations, or deaths was observed after the election,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6930a4-H.pdf" target="_blank">the authors of the report stated</a>, while pointing out that the large number of Milwaukee residents who voted by mail and the safety measures taken at the precincts likely helped, too. (An <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/news/press-center/archives/2020/5/in-person-voting-linked-to-spread-covid-19" target="_blank">earlier study</a> looking at county-level data in the state did find a link between in-person voting and COVID-19 infection. But keep in mind that early April was before face masks were widely adopted.)</p><p>At this stage of the pandemic, many experts seem to agree that the risk from in-person voting is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/voting-during-pandemic-pretty-safe/616084/" target="_blank">relatively low</a> for healthy individuals <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html" target="_blank">who are not in a high-risk group</a> (more on that in a minute) and take the proper precautions. That includes wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing in line, and practicing <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/using-hand-sanitizer-wrong-mistakes_l_5f0cb639c5b6af83647d4c11" target="_blank">proper hand hygiene</a>.</p><p><a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/lee-riley/" target="_blank">Lee Riley</a>, professor and head of the infectious diseases and vaccinology division at the University of California, Berkeley, told HuffPost it&#8217;s actually the poll workers &#8213; not the voters &#8213; who are at greater risk of infection. They&#8217;ll be interacting with many people inside the voting location.</p><p>&#8220;For the voters themselves, as long as they wear a mask and maintain social distancing of 6 feet, and sanitize their hands after they cast their vote, the risk is minimal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most of the wait time for voting will be outside in many places, which will be safer than in enclosed spaces.&#8221;</p><blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"><p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"></p><p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli">&#8220;For the voters themselves, as long as they wear a mask and maintain social distancing of 6 feet, and sanitize their hands after they cast their vote, the risk is minimal.&#8221;</p><p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli">- Lee Riley, professor and head of the infectious diseases and vaccinology division at the University of California, Berkeley</p></blockquote><p>That said, any amount of risk may be too great for those who fall into the high-risk category &#8212; or live with someone who does.

Make a voting plan. </strong></p><p>&#8220;Plan in advance how to get there and what time of day for lowest lines,&#8221; Patel said.</p><p><a href="https://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/" target="_blank">Depending on what state you live in</a>, you may able to cast your ballot in person during the early voting period, instead of on Election Day.</p><p><strong>2. This should go without saying, but if you&#8217;re sick, stay home.</strong></p><p>&#8220;Do not vote in person if you are feeling unwell,&#8221; Nanda said.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-10-who-can-collect-and-return-an-absentee-ballot-other-than-the-voter.aspx" target="_blank">many states</a>, someone else can <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/" target="_blank">submit your absentee ballot</a> for you.</p><p><strong>3. Consider getting a flu shot beforehand.</strong></p><p>Nanda recommends getting your influenza vaccine at least two weeks before you plan to vote to allow <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-time-flu-shot-covid-19-pandemic_l_5f4cffb5c5b6cf66b2baf261" target="_blank">enough time for antibodies to build up</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Wear your face mask. </strong></p><p>You want a face covering that has a couple layers and fits you well, Nanda said. </p><p>&#8220;Wear a mask while you wait, when you go inside the voting booth, and afterwards until you get home,&#8221; Riley added.</p><p>Patel also suggested bringing a few extra disposable masks with you in case someone in line needs one and you want to hand it out.</p><p><strong>5. Bring your filled-out sample ballot with you to speed up the process. </strong></p><p>&#8220;That [way] you don&#8217;t have to spend too much time to fill out the ballot at the voting booth,&#8221; Riley said.</p><p><strong>6. Pack a bag with hand sanitizer, a pen and maybe a book to pass the time.</strong></p><p>Remember you want a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/qa-consumers-hand-sanitizers-and-covid-19" target="_blank">hand sanitizer that&#8217;s at least 60% alcohol</a> to clean your hands before and after you vote.</p><p>Patel also suggested bringing some unused tissues or napkins in case you need to grab any high-tough surfaces like door handles.</p><p><strong>7. Maintain social distancing.</strong></p><p>Stay a minimum of 6 feet from other voters in line.</p><p>If you&#8217;re concerned that won&#8217;t be possible at your polling place and you&#8217;d rather not take a chance, voting by mail is still a great option. Just be sure to return your ballot early if you can, rather than waiting until the deadline.</p><p class="cli-embed__embed-wrapper"></p></div>

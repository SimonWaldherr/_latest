A light heavyweight fight is in the works for Nov. 28.

The UFC is targeting veteran 205-pounders Devin Clark and Shamil Gamzatov for the event, which is scheduled to take place at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.

Multiple people with knowledge of the situation recently confirmed the targeted booking to MMA Junkie but asked to remain anonymous as the promotion has yet to make an official announcement.

Clark (12-4 MMA, 6-4 UFC) has won three of his most recent four outings. After defeating Dequan Townsend by unanimous decision at UFC on ESPN+ 25 in February, Clark returned to take on Alonzo Menifield at 250 in June. Despite breaking his orbital bone in Round 1, Clark rallied to get his second straight unanimous decision nod.

Gamzatov (14-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC) won his lone UFC fight in November when he defeated Klidson Abreu by split decision. Gamzatov was booked twice since then â€“ both times against Ovince Saint Preux. However, both bookings fell through.

With the addition, the Nov. 28 lineup includes:

Curtis Blaydes vs. Derrick Lewis

Rafael Fiziev vs. Renato Moicano

Norma Dumont vs. Ashlee Evans-Smith

Josh Parisian vs. Parker Porter

Martin Day vs. Anderson dos Santos

Gina Mazany vs. Rachael Ostovich

Malcolm Gordon vs. Su Mudaerji

Devin Clark vs. Shamil Gamzatov

<p>&#8220;It is with great sadness and heavy heart that we report on the passing of Satmar President and Mega Philanthropist R&#8217;Mayer Zelig Rispler OBM who passed away during the night,&#8221; the <a href="https://twitter.com/HQSatmar/status/1317069185650970624" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Satmar Hasidic sect tweeted Friday</a>.</p>
<p>A funeral for the 70-year-old rabbi was held in Williamsburg that day, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/mayer-rispler-70-satmar-leader-who-urged-following-virus-rules-dies-of-covid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Times of Israel said</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;R&#8217;Mayer Zelig was a courageous and dedicated leader who will be missed by the worldwide Satmar Community,&#8221; the sect tweeted, <a href="https://twitter.com/HQSatmar/status/1317118533973803010" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirming his death was from COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>Rispler had spoken out in April to urge the Orthodox community to adhere to safety measures enforced by city officials after videos went viral of <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/28/de-blasio-blasts-jewish-community-for-massive-brooklyn-funeral/">huge crowds gathering for funerals</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not condone any behavior that puts people at risk and pledge to keep working alongside the brave men and women of the NYPD in addressing and eliminating any such occurrences,&#8221; Rispler wrote, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hasidic-leaders-defend-ny-mayor-and-call-on-community-to-socially-distance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a Times of Israel</a> report at the time.</p>
<p>Rispler &#8212; who was also an accountant &#8212; fell ill in September, and on Wednesday the Satmar Headquarters account called for prayers, confirming he was in <a href="https://twitter.com/HQSatmar/status/1316473788264058882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;critical condition.&#8221;</a></p>

<div><p>The Dak Prescott-less era in Dallas <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/cowboys-look-lost-without-dak-prescott-in-humiliating-loss-to-cardinals/">is off to a sad start</a>.</p>
<p>The Cowboys fell to the Arizona Cardinals on Monday, 38-10, as backup quarterback Andy Dalton threw for 266 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. Pro Bowl running back Ezekiel Elliott lost two fumbles, finishing the game with 49 yards.</p>
<p>With their team dropping to 2-4 on the season, some at AT&amp;T Stadium could barely look at what was unfolding before their eyes, namely one fan who couldn&#8217;t be consoled by his partner. The clip, which aired during ESPN&#8217;s &#8220;Monday Night Football,&#8221; has naturally become a meme on Twitter.</p>

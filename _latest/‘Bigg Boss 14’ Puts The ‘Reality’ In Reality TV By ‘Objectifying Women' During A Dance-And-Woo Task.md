That Indian television has blurred the lines between entertainment and straight-up hilarity is no news. But, in the entire circus of TRPs and bizarre plot points, Bigg Boss on Colors TV takes the cake! From verbal and physical face-offs to voyeuristic pleasure, there is absolutely nothing the show won‚Äôt give its die-hard fans and loyal viewer base. Oh, yes there are takers for the bullsh*t BB peddles and in numbers that will put the biggest fandoms to shame. Which is why it‚Äôs even more worrying and alarming that the youth of the country is being served problematic behaviour on a plate where they often see it getting rewarded too! I‚Äôm aware of the format of the show and I‚Äôm not one to comment about a ban on it (primarily because it is never the solution), it is bewildering to see what passes as content.

Make no mistake; I have watched a few episodes here and there from the last 13 seasons (yeah there‚Äôs those many installments of that) and every time I thought to myself that they can‚Äôt stoop any lower, I‚Äôve stood corrected and how! In fact, just when I thought that I have seen everything--including a self-acclaimed Godman throw urine at a female contestant--the makers/taskmasters have put my assumptions to same. Call it peak reality TV or just the abysmal lows of the medium, this season they are asking female contestants to dance and woo Siddharth Shukla, the winner of BB13. Now, there are multiple things wrong with the sentence including the channel‚Äôs fixation with Shukla who was notorious and infamous for his bullying last season (another article for another article). But mostly how they chose to make the women in the house win immunity for themselves‚Äì by seducing the man(child), frolicking in fake rain! Yes, it‚Äôs still 2020 but Colors TV and the Salman Khan-led show seems to have lost grip on time and the pressing issues of women safety that we are currently protesting about.

They even took to Twitter to tease the audiences with the promo and text that read, ‚Äú#BB14 ke ghar ki haseenaon ne dikhaaye Sidharth Shukla ko impress karne ke liye apne jalwe!‚Äù See the clip below and ask you gut. Do we really need to normalize this classic case of derogatory male gaze especially when rape cases are towering? Do we really need commodification of women, their bodies and ‚Äòjalwe‚Äô to rake in TRPs when violence against women is on the rise?

A big ‚ÄòNO‚Äô should be the answer. And don‚Äôt you dare throw consent in my face; no signed contract is worth it if it backtracks the cause of women rights and agency. I mean, why weren‚Äôt the men on the show put to the same task when Rubina Dilaik, Jasmin Bhasin, Nikki Tamboli and Pavitra Punia did what they had to do? I‚Äôm not going to find out cause I‚Äôm not going to watch it and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one. Twitter is rightly angry about the episode well, minus a fraction that is cheering and lauding the act!

Check out all the reactions here.

I'm shook at how others inside are enjoying and hooting in the promo. This goes on fucking national television, do they even realise that! The amount of audience they have, the makers should be a bit aware about the influence the show has.#BoycottBB14 ‚Äî Zaviü•Ä (@SanaKiFakeID) October 7, 2020

U have to seduce a man for immunity and the man gonna tell who seduced him better :)

Wow... Just wow :) https://t.co/KjYgtRVGy4 ‚Äî Y üå∏ (@behnaam_y) October 8, 2020

Lol wtf is this.

Glad I am not watching this season https://t.co/k3c2iMMY5M ‚Äî Sayar (@iamSincereSayar) October 8, 2020

It‚Äôs high time that Bigg Boss must be boycotted. The last season they promoted violence and this season vulgarity. @BiggBoss don‚Äôt you think it is your responsibility to promote the good stuffs?!! Especially when you are watched by a good portion of audience #BOYCOTTBB14 ‚Äî Hermoine Granger (@meetisimushkil) October 7, 2020

A show with this level of vulgarity is being telecasted on a Television channel and that too at prime time....shame on @EndemolShineIND and @colors Repeat after me

It's VULGARITY and not ENTERTAINMENT#BoycottBB14 ‚Äî Khushboo Sharma (@sharmakhushbo0) October 7, 2020

This season trying to normalize objectifying women. cheapü§¢ #BoycottBB14 ‚Äî Hrithuüñ§ (@hrithuu_kk) October 7, 2020

Putting raunchy scenes into #BiggBoss14 and objectifying the female contestants is stupid and unnecessary, especially in the current climate in India where attacks on women are on the rise. Just saw one promo and it made me sick. ‚Äî Asjad Nazir (@asjadnazir) October 7, 2020

Thank you, dear sane and woke folks of the Twitterverse. Thank you for holding the fort and fighting the right fight. Also, hey Bigg Boss ‚Äì DO BETTER!

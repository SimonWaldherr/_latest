American horror writer Shirley Jackson is having a bit of a moment. The end of this month sees the UK release of Shirley – a biopic starring the Mad Men and The Handmaid’s Tale star Elisabeth Moss. And Jackson’s classic ghost story The Haunting of Hill House was given a recent fillip by a superbly spooky Netflix adaptation.

Yet what’s less well known is how she first rose to prominence. Jackson was right at the beginning of her career, and virtually unknown, when, in 1948, The New Yorker published her short story The Lottery. Overnight it made her famous – or, properly, infamous. You could think of it as the Cat Person of its day.

The Lottery is set in an unnamed New England town – modelled on Bennington, Vermont, where Jackson lived with her husband and children. As it opens, a holiday atmosphere is established: “The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full­ summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green.” Everyone’s a bit excited about the lottery – an annual tradition that goes back as far as anyone can remember. This being a small town, the whole thing can be got over within less than two hours, we’re told, so everyone will get home for dinner. The children scamper and play. Little boys make a pile of stones. Mothers gossip. Fathers trade jokes and smiles.

When everyone’s assembled, the genial master of ceremonies produces a tatty old black box filled with slips of paper – it used to be wood chips, but times have changed – and the male heads of households take turns drawing out a slip.

As the process unfolds, we’re treated to little slices of smalltown chatter. Some nearby towns are even talking of abolishing the lottery, someone remarks.

“Pack of crazy fools,” says Old Man Warner. “Listening to the young folks, nothing’s good enough for them. Next thing you know, they’ll be wanting to go back to living in caves.”

This year, the Hutchinson family are the winners. Mrs Hutchinson complains that it’s unfair, but the townsfolk pay her little attention. A second draw takes place among the five members of the Hutchinson household – and Mrs Hutchinson comes up with the black spot.

At which point – spoiler alert – everyone grabs a rock and stones her to death. The whole thing is dispatched in not much more than 3,000 words.

The response to this clever little sliver of grand guignol was not entirely positive. It’s said to have been the most complained-about story in the history of The New Yorker.

Readers called it “gruesome”, “outrageous”, “perverted” and “utterly pointless”. Hundreds of subscriptions were cancelled, and the story was banned outright in South Africa. Jackson herself at one point was getting 12 letters a day forwarded from The New Yorker, barely a single one in favour: “Of the 300-odd letters that I received that summer,” she said later, “I can count only 13 that spoke kindly to me, and they were mostly from friends.”

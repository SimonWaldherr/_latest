  Inside Line: Risk, reward and Finn Russell - why fly-half's death-or-glory performance deserves praise

  Some coaches would rail against using the term ‘risky’ to describe an extravagant pass, offload or cross-kick.They would suggest that players should hone flicks and tricks in training scenarios so they are comfortable unfurling them during games… when appropriate.Finn Russell’s performance was a major reason why the Champions Cup final between his Racing 92 side and eventual winners Exeter Chiefs was so compelling.The 28-year-old’s ability means that fizzing distribution and impish chips, often in his own territory, do not always seem dicey.From just outside the Racing 22, after his team has stolen an Exeter lineout, he skips Henry Chavancy and sends Virimi Vakatawa between Sam Simmonds and Ian Whitten to sweep the French team up-field:

The 28-year-old&#8217;s ability means that fizzing distribution and impish chips, often in his own territory, do not always seem dicey. They have become routine options.</p>
<p>This is the first of 30 passes Russell threw at Ashton Gate. From just outside the Racing 22, after his team has stolen an Exeter lineout, he skips Henry Chavancy and sends Virimi Vakatawa between Sam Simmonds and Ian Whitten to sweep the French team up-field:</p>

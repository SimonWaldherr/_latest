<div><p>&#8220;My intention was not to leave the club and I was happy there- as happy as I am now here," Herrera explains. "It was not a secret. I was negotiating for more than one year but I expected more from the board after my third season at the club when I was player of the year. They didn&#8217;t come to me that summer; they didn&#8217;t even call me. And that was very painful for me because I had a feeling that I was giving everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;In saying that I have a huge respect for [executive vice-chairman] Ed Woodward, a huge respect for the board. They have always treated me fantastically. I know they want the best for Manchester United but in football, in life and in every company in the world sometimes you don&#8217;t think the same way and I respect that. If I see Ed I will give him a hug. We just had different opinions about Manchester United and, in my opinion, what the club should have done.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to make sure everyone understands there is nothing personal at all. That&#8217;s life. But it&#8217;s true &#8211; after the third season when I was player of the year, when I had the respect and the love from the fans, I didn&#8217;t feel that love from the club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herrera&#8217;s bond with United remains strong and it was telling that he was the last person who his former PSG team-mate, Edinson Cavani, called <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/06/edinson-cavani-superstar-striker-mean-streak-will-want-prove/">before he joined the club on deadline day.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I think we spoke about five minutes before he said yes,&#8221; Herrera explains. &#8220;He called me and said, &#8216;I need to make a decision now and you are the last person I am speaking to before I make that decision&#8217;. I told him to play for Manchester United is an opportunity that is for the rest of your life. To play for other clubs in the Premier League you are a Premier League player but if you are a Manchester United player then you are a Manchester United player for life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is different. I have been all around the world and been recognised as a Manchester United player and I have the respect of everyone. I think Cavani is also made for Old Trafford; the way he fights for every ball &#8211; even the way he celebrates goals, he is a very Manchester United player. I told him he was going to play for the biggest club in the UK. I don&#8217;t think he needed to hear that from me but mine was the last opinion.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>While Cavani has been deemed not yet match-fit for Tuesday night&#8217;s game in Paris, it remains a mouthwatering first clash in a daunting Champions League group that also includes RB Leipzig and Turkish champions, Istanbul Basaksehir.</p>
<p>PSG overcame Leipzig in the last four of last season&#8217;s competition <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/08/23/psg-vs-bayern-munich-champions-league-final-2020-live-score2/">before narrowly losing the final 1-0 to Bayern Munich.</a> The disappointment took some time to get over. &#8220;You need that time to re-start, to get some energy. It&#8217;s football,&#8221; Herrera says. &#8220;I guess Tottenham had a difficult few months after they reached the final the year before because similar to us it was the first time they had done that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the feeling that in this group you cannot make too many mistakes and as soon as you lose one game you are in trouble,&#8221; Herrera says. &#8220;But these are the kind of games you want to play in the Champions League.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have done something great and the experience of other clubs is that when they reach one final in the next few years they reach more. That says it&#8217;s not the only opportunity. We will be back and are ready to fight again and take the club to another European final."</p>
<p>Last season's defeat to Bayern may have been deflating but it has not dimmed the ambition in the French capital. &#8220;The ambition is huge,&#8221; Herrera says. &#8220;It is only about winning. You cannot compare 142 years of history [at United] to 50 [at PSG]. But the way this club has grown up is unbelievable. In 50 years I don&#8217;t think there is a comparison in the way it has developed into one of the biggest clubs in Europe.&#8221;</p>

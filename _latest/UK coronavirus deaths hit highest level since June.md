<div><p>Boris Johnson is preparing impose stringent new coronavirus controls on 2.8 million people in Greater Manchester after talks with local leaders failed to reach agreement.</p>
<p>Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick warned civic chiefs last night that they have until midday on Tuesday to reach a deal or face unilateral Government action.</p>
<p>The leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese said he still hoped it would be possible to find an agreed way forward in the hours remaining.</p>
<p>However he acknowledged they would have no choice but to comply if ministers decided to impose the most stringent Tier 3 restrictions.</p>
<p>"I am hoping that tomorrow (Tuesday) morning we will be able to sit down again with ministers and come to an agreement which will serve the best interests of the people of Manchester," he told BBC2's Newsnight.</p>
<p>"Clearly if Government imposes Tier 3 - and I hope that won't happen - we will clearly need to comply with that."</p>
<p>There was anger among some of those involved in the negotiations at what they said was the use of "selective statistics" by the Government to raise concern about the public health situation in the region.</p>
<p>In a joint statement with Sir Richard, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham also complained that a previous offer of financial support had been withdrawn by ministers.</p>
<p>Mr Jenrick, however, said that after 10 days of negotiations failed to reach an agreement, the deteriorating situation in the region meant the Government had no choice but to act.</p>

<br> &#160;"I have written to local leaders this evening to make clear that if we cannot reach agreement by midday tomorrow then I must advise the Prime Minister that despite our best endeavours we've been unable to reach agreement."

<div><p>So, we all remember <i>Money Heist</i> right? The Netflix crime drama recently made us binge through season 4, after re-watching all the previous ones as recap. The series was initially <i>Le casa de papel </i>was intended as a limited series to be told in two parts and had its original run of 15 episodes on a Spanish network. But soon enough, the internet happened and Netflix acquired the global streaming rights for the same, re-cut the series in two and then renewed it for part 3 and 4. Basically, it earned a cult following even with its often implausible plots for reasons other than those plots. But if you ask me, mostly because of Professor played by Alavaro Morte and his gang of Dali-mask wearing goons including Rio (Miguel Herr&#225;n), Tokyo (&#218;rsula Corber&#243;), Helsinki (Darko Peri&#263;), Nairobi (Alba Flores), Denver (Jaime Lorente), Stockholm (Esther Acebo).</p>

<p>Which brings us to this &#8211; a shocker. Apparently, there is a Pakistani film and it bears striking similarities with Money Heist. It is titled '50 Crores' and stars actors including Aijaz Aslam who even took to Twitter to share a sneak peek of mugshots. And it&#8217;s something we have seen already.</p>

 

<p>Upon further digging, it turns out, Aslam&#8217;s mugshots are not an isolated event. In fact, there is an entire troop who have their mugshots taken with names of Pakistani cities on the tags just like in Money Heist.</p>

<p>Needless to say, <i>desi</i> Twitter is losing it! While some are worried about which bank and what money will they loot, the rest are busy calling it a <i>sasti </i>copy. And can you blame them?</p>

<p>If you are still here; the fourth installment of Money Heist ended with a bang minus the end of a few beloved characters like Nairobi. Now, the show could see another season but Netflix hasn&#8217;t made any announcement yet. Although, amidst speculations of the same, there was a Twitter frenzy where people thought that Netflix pulled down the show. Yeah, like that could happen!</p>

A decade ago, I was working in a fashion publishing house on Rue du Bac. Like Emily, I watched my co-workers raise an eyebrow each time I wore something too bright or too short - once I arrived in a pair of leopard-print tights and saw a woman fan herself in distress.

But unlike Emily, I quickly abandoned all sense of personal style and started dressing in head-to-toe navy. While some of the pieces Emily wears are hypnotic in a drunk butterfly sort of way, watching the show made me glad I had been so desperate to fit in. Certain cities welcome people who bring their own look to the table: London is one of them, Paris is definitely not.

Emily breaks every French fashion rule. She wears white stiletto ankle boots; furry crop tops, and an endless succession of berets and neckerchiefs. Her colleagues’ reactions make me laugh – “You have no mystery. You’re very, very obvious.” But notably it’s always the women whose lips curl.

The straight men, who are all absurdly handsome, fall at Emily’s feet in a collective puddle. Surely one of them would ask why she was wearing a camouflage and pink lace miniskirt? I was given constant advice on how to dress by Parisian males of all ages.

Luckily, Emily isn’t even the sartorial star of her own show. Sylvie, her equally cliche-ridden French boss - who is embroiled in an affair with a married man and smokes constantly - has genuinely great clothes.

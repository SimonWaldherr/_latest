Hundreds of thousands of jobs are still at risk as Rishi Sunak’s new grants to businesses closed by local lockdowns and their staff are “not enough”, employers have warned.

The extra furlough scheme and handouts to companies are too little for those ordered to shut their doors, and do nothing for those whose incomes have been flattened by the curfew and other restrictions, firms said.

“It is right that the Chancellor has responded to our long-standing calls for more local support, as so many areas across the UK now face restrictions and closures. More generous cash grants will be of some help, but for most this will not be enough to offset a sustained cash crunch,” said Adam Marshall at the British Chambers of Commerce.

“As welcome as this new support will be for companies shut down by government decree, additional local restrictions and lockdowns will have a material impact on many other firms, especially in supply chains and in town and city centres. Their cash flow concerns, and worries about future demand, must be heeded.”

The hospitality industry in particular is still struggling, with tighter restrictions on customer numbers, visitor hours and, in Scotland, a ban on serving alcohol indoors.

The new measures only apply to businesses ordered to close completely, rather than partially, and so fail to help the sector outside a full lockdown.

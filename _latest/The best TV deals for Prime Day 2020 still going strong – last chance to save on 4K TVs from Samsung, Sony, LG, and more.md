Amazon Prime Day Samsung TV deals

Samsung has a number of its coolest TVs on sale for Prime Day 2020. Among the deals are the artistically designed Frame and Serif TVs, as well as the Sero TV, which has a rotatable screen that can show video in both portrait and landscape orientation. There's also a deal on an outdoor TV and a more normal 4K QLED TV.

Amazon Prime Day TV deals from Sony

You'll find the 55- and 65-inch versions of Sony's X800H 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV with HDR on sale. Sony's TVs are well-known for their high-end image processing, so what you get is not only high-resolution image quality, but it's also beautifully rendered. The X800H uses Smart Android TV but it's also compatible with Alexa and Apple AirPlay 2. For cinephiles on a budget, this TV is a gem, and it's discounted.

Amazon Prime Day TV deals at Best Buy

Coinciding with Prime Day, Best Buy also has a number of TV deals that are live right now. One of Sony's best 4K OLED TVs is on sale in two sizes, and there's a deal on an 8K TV from LG for early adopters who just can't wait for the highest resolution money can buy. Budget shoppers can save $120 off a 50-inch 4K UHD LED TV from TCL. Check out our coverage of Best Buy's competing sale.

Amazon Prime Day 8K TV deals

Although 8K TVs are still the stuff of the future due to the limited availability of 8K video content and the giant price tags associated with them, 8K TVs are assuredly cutting edge. This Prime Day, you can get discounts on some of them, so if you're an early adopter, these 8K TV deals are for you.

Amazon Prime Day Fire TV deals

Before the event kicked off, Amazon offered a bunch of early deals on select Toshiba and Insignia Fire TV Edition TVs. Those early deals will be available until October 15 while supplies last, and some are already out of stock.

All of the discounted Fire TVs include built-in support for Amazon's Fire TV streaming platform, enabling easy access to a large assortment of apps. Many popular services, like Prime Video, Netflix, and Disney Plus, are all included. On the downside, HBO Max and Peacock are currently missing from Fire TV devices.

Discounted models range from 24- to 55-inches, and displays are available in HD and 4K resolutions. If you're a casual buyer who just wants a reliable TV with a smaller screen for simple streaming, one of the 24- or 32-inch models with a 720p or 1080p screen should be a solid buy, especially with the current deal prices.

For buyers who want to take advantage of newer picture technologies, like HDR, we recommend going with one of the larger screen models with Dolby Vision support. With that said, though good entry-level displays, none of these TVs offer advanced home theater performance. For the best picture quality, you're better off waiting for potential deals on mid-range models from Sony, LG, Samsung, Vizio, TCL, and Hisense.

When is Prime Day?

Amazon Prime Day 2020 began on October 13 and deals will keep coming through the end of today, October 14. We've seen many TV deals will go live throughout the two-day period so far, so be sure to check this page frequently for all the best discounts.

Prime Day deals will only be available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you're not already a member, a Prime subscription costs $13 a month, or $120 a year if you pay for an annual plan. Prime memberships include several perks and benefits, like free two-day shipping on a ton of products, Prime video streaming, and more.

A free 30-day trial is available to new members. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can sign up now to test the service for free and enjoy all the Prime Day deals when they launch.

How to shop for a TV

TVs vary wildly in price, features, and size, so choosing the right display for your needs can be tricky. When it comes to budget models, you can now find smaller HDTVs for as little as $100. On the higher end, flagship 65-inch 4K TVs can go for $1,500 or more. The best 8K TVs can even cost over $10,000 depending on how big the screen is.

If you're looking for a TV with home theater performance as a top priority, then you'll want to opt for a 4K model with at least a 65-inch panel. The best 4K TVs feature an OLED screen, or an advanced LED screen with local dimming. These display technologies provide the highest contrast, deepest black levels, and brightest picture for impressive high dynamic range (HDR) images.

For shoppers who simply want a basic display for casual viewing, a smaller TV with a more affordable LED panel should be more than fine. Though picture quality won't be as good as pricier TV models, there are plenty of solid budget LED TVs, including inexpensive models that still offer 4K resolution and built-in smart TV streaming platforms.

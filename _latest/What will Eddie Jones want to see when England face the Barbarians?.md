<div><p>Eddie Jones will be eager to tick some boxes at Twickenham on Sunday against the Barbarians.</p>
<p>He has asked his men to play with passion, pride and energy because they can &#8220;do something special for the English rugby community and the wider community&#8221; in difficult times.</p>
<p>Ahead of an intriguing, unique autumn, here are a few more&#160;goals that Jones will want to fulfill.</p>
<h3>Authority from Owen Farrell</h3>
<p>Since kicking 15 points in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2020/03/10/six-nations-ruck-ratings-england-taught-wales-value-boring/">a 33-30 victory over Wales on March 7</a>, England&#8217;s skipper has played precisely 141 minutes of rugby for Saracens. And, as you will know, his emergence from lockdown did not go entirely to plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2020/08/22/owen-farrell-delivers-standout-performance-dominant-saracens/">An 18-point outing against Harlequins in August was sharp and slick</a>. But then came a slight quadriceps injury and a clunky, error-strewn afternoon at Allianz Park two weeks later that ended prematurely <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2020/09/07/inside-line-red-card-owen-farrell-will-not-change-england-captains/">when Farrell clattered 18-year-old Wasps fly-half Charlie Atkinson and was sent off</a>.</p>
<p>A five-week ban relegated him to water boy duties for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2020/09/20/inside-line-saracens-beat-leinster-masterpiece-togetherness/">Saracens&#8217; stirring Champions Cup performances against Leinster</a> and Racing 92. Farrell would have had an influential role in preparations, but would have been itching for more.</p>

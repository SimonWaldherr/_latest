A new survey from The Hollywood Commission confirms that abusive conduct is a pervasive problem in Hollywood made worse by the entertainment industry's power imbalances – and the targets of the bullying are often young workers and assistants.

The report released Wednesday – the third part of a survey of almost 10,000 people working or who have sought work in the entertainment industry found that women are twice as likely as men to report experiencing abusive workplace conduct. In addition, employees under the age of 40 were far more likely to report instances of bullying, with reported rates decreasing steadily with age.

In Hollywood, bullying has been "condoned as part of ‘paying your dues’ on the way up" and "openly displayed" in films such as "Swimming With Sharks" (1995) and this year's "The Assistant," said Anita Hill, chairman of The Hollywood Commission and a professor of social policy and gender studies at Brandeis University.

First part of survey:65% doubt Hollywood's sexual harassers will be held accountable

Second part of survey:Men more likely than women to view entertainment industry as valuing diversity

“Bullying may once have been an accepted norm, but in 2020, workers understand the harm that an environment rife with humiliating insults, sarcasm, swearing and throwing objects in anger causes. And belittling, vulgar and demeaning language and behavior is a gateway to sexual harassment and other abusive conduct," Hill said. "It’s time for Hollywood to commit to treating all workers with basic humanity and dignity.”

Assistants are frequent targets (73%) of bullying behavior (including insults, humiliating gestures, yelling, cursing and physically aggressive behavior) and of those, 99% were under 40. Individuals with a disability were twice as likely as those without to report workplace bullying.

So who's doing the bullying? Mainly supervisors, those in charge of hours, workloads, assignments and job status, and the majority were 68% male compared to 31% female.

In terms of how respect has improved since the beginning of the #MeToo movement, a majority (65%) of the survey's 9,630 respondents have seen moderate to a lot of progress in terms of promoting respect, although females have noticed less progress (59%) than did men (74%). The report did find a positive view of progress increasing with age, with women under 39 having the least positive view (55%).

The survey recommended increased accountability and awareness as keys to ending bullying in the workplace, and The Hollywood Commission is conducting interactive workshops to address and manage abusive behaviors.

The findings follow the commission's recent reports on sexual harassment accountability and diversity.

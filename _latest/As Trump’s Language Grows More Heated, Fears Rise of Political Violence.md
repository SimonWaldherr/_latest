In a report released this month describing threats to the United States, analysts at the Department of Homeland Security warned of potential plots that mirror the schemes in Michigan and Virginia thwarted by the F.B.I.

Keep up with Election 2020

The International Crisis Group, whose mission is to sound an alarm ahead of deadly conflicts in hot spots around the globe, last month turned its attention for the first time to possible election-related violence in the United States.

Warning that far-right militias could take matters into their own hands in key states if ballots are contested, Robert Malley, the president of the group, said, “We would never predict civil war, but isolated incidents of violence could be quite serious.”

The months of anti-police protests this summer sometimes turned to looting and arson, and Mr. Malley said there were some armed extremists on the left. But he emphasized that the real concern came from the right, where violent messaging had already produced deadly results, including the shooting death of two people during protests in Kenosha, Wis. Mr. Malley said that in assessing the potential for further violence, “the balance very clearly tilts toward the responsibility of President Trump.”

The president has called on supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully,” a phrase that some security experts interpret as a call to take up arms and patrol polling stations. During the first presidential debate, he alerted the Proud Boys, a group associated with white supremacy, to “stand by.”

“It’s so concerning the president just doesn’t seem to have any kind of guard rails between what he thinks at the spur of the moment and what he says or writes,” said Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of homeland security. “We’ve seen it in the rise of these right-wing militia groups and it’s almost as if implicitly he’s giving them permission to take whatever action they want up to and including kidnapping a sitting governor.”

Hunter Biden’s emails and texts show not just a politician’s troubled son angling for lucrative overseas business deals — they also reveal a concerned father, a fun-loving friend and a man tortured by the deaths that have devastated his family.

In a text-message exchange from 2018, eldest daughter Naomi — named after Biden’s late sister, who was killed with their mother, Neilia, in a 1972 car crash — pleaded with her dad for emergency cash.

“Can you put 150 in my account it was just declined for lyft to airport sorry sorry sorry,” the now-26-year-old Columbia Law student asked.

“Yes I can but Naomi you ­really have to start to realize that once you are out of school the chances of you living like your father is a billionaire when he’s really given all his money away- is going to be a bit of a shock,” Hunter answered.

“I know I promise ill be much better this year!!!!!!!!!!! Promise,” Naomi wrote back.

Naomi didn’t return a request for comment, but neither Hunter Biden’s lawyer nor Joe Biden’s campaign have disputed the validity of the trove of data that The Post obtained after being extracted from a MacBook Pro laptop. The owner of a Delaware computer-repair shop said the machine was dropped off in April 2019 but never retrieved.

A computer camera roll of nearly 25,000 images is loaded with sexually explicit selfies and porn (which The Post is not publishing), but also has snapshots from Biden’s childhood and vacations.

And while some of the more than 11,550 emails involve Biden’s former job on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma and his dealings with the now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co., most of his messages are innocuous and personal in nature.

A 2019 text exchange shows Biden corresponding with a pal, Mehall Ledwith, who was celebrating St. Patrick’s Day at The Chelsea Bell bar in Manhattan.

“That sounds like fun. Where dat,” Biden wrote.

Another exchange, from 2018, shows Biden inviting a friend to The Hollywood Roosevelt hotel in LA, saying he has a “cabana suite” and is “partying like an idiot ass rock star.”

“Haha sounds ridiculously fun then. I can maybe try to come later,” Andrew Boshop wrote.

“I’ll make your night dude,” Biden replied.

Ledwith said he didn’t recall the St. Patrick’s Day exchange but said he and Biden were friends who have communicated by text. Boshop didn’t return a request for comment.

Biden — who has acknowledged struggling with drug and alcohol problems — also poured his heart out in a lengthy email that he sent to himself in 2015, about three weeks after his brother, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, died of brain cancer.

In the nearly-800-word missive, which is filled with misspellings, Biden recounts going to church as a child with his father and brother on “every Sunday growing up” — as well as the Mass he attended the day following Beau’s death.

“I missed his touch – I could feel him there in our [midst] I could smell him-but he wasn’t there he was gone,” Biden wrote.

Biden wrote that while kneeling in the pew, “for the first time in my life [I] prayed to [not] just my dead mother and my dead sister but also to my dead brother.”

“And for the first time in my [life, I] prayed for me-and I asked please let me be with you please let me know you love me please let me forget please let me come.”

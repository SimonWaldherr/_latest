Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said the region will resist going into a Tier 3 lockdown and could launch a legal challenge against ministers if the restrictions are imposed.

Mr Burnham told an online press conference that if Greater Manchester was put into Tier 3 it would be "by imposition, not consent". He added that the region would only accept such restrictions if the Government commits to an 80 per cent furlough scheme.

“We oppose the Tier 3 proposal and we will not cave in to all of the pressure that's being applied to us unless we can be given clear evidence. But more than that, the substantial financial support that's needed to protect our communities through this,” he said.

Asked if they would consider legal action against the Government, Mr Burnham said: "We are law abiding people, we would respect the law of the land.

"But, we would consider other routes, legal routes, where we could protect our many thousands of residents who are going to be left in severe hardship in the run up to Christmas.

"We would not just leave them in the lurch, we would try and support them and that would include any legal action we could take on their behalf."

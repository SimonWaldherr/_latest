<div><p>On a day when most other news was depressing, the Queen&#8217;s candyfloss-coloured outfit couldn&#8217;t have been better timed. In a coat by Stewart Parvin and a matching floral hat from Rachel Trevor Morgan, the 94-year-old monarch looked positively spring-like on a drizzly October morning&#160; as she visited the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Salisbury.&#160;</p>
<p>Today's occasion represented the first time we have seen Her Majesty attend an event in public since the coronavirus crisis began in March. The very image of her is important in this instance; to see her in good health, and wearing good colours, is in its own way a symbol of cheering stability for the nation.</p>
<p>Parvin is as close as it comes to a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/vest-top-proves-duchess-sussex-stepping-back-strict-royal-dress/">royal couturier</a> in the 21st century. He has been the Queen&#8217;s dressmaker for nearly 20 years and in 2016 was awarded a Royal Victorian Order - for the ceremony, the Queen even paid him the compliment of wearing one of his dresses.</p>
<p>Parvin also designed Zara Tindall&#8217;s wedding dress in 2011 and William Hill had him down as a favourite to make the Duchess of Sussex&#8217;s bridal gown - which was of course in reality designed by Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy.&#160;</p>

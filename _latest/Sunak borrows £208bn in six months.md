<div><p>Rishi Sunak has launched a one-year spending review, aiming to set out financial plans for 2021-22, as he racked up a sixth month of bumper borrowing in September.</p>
<p>A three-year review had been expected, but the Chancellor blamed the uncertainty around Covid for the shorter horizon. It will not<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/10/chancellor-faces-backlash-tax-rise-plans-self-employed/"> include tax hikes</a>&#160;that&#160;could help plug the deficit but would also risk damaging the recovery.</p>
<p>He borrowed <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/21/markets-live-latest-coronavirus-news-pound-euro-ftse-100/">another &#163;36.1bn last month</a>, the Office for National Statistics estimates, up from &#163;30.1bn in August and the third-biggest monthly deficit on record.</p>
<p>It means that the Government has borrowed &#163;208.5bn in the first six months of this financial year, amounting to &#163;50bn more than the deficit for the entire worst year of the financial crisis. The national debt now stands at 103.5pc of GDP.</p>

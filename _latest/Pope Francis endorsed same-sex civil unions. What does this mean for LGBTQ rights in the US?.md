For instance, same-sex couples in civil unions were not always able to access the same Social Security or disability benefits as married couple. Legal rights did not always carry over&#160;across state lines, either, until the dissolution of DOMA.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">What has Pope Francis previously said about same-sex couples?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Francis has a complicated history with the LGBTQ community, specifically on the issue of same-sex marriage.&#160;While he was&#160;archbishop of Buenos Aires, he previously endorsed civil unions for gay couples in lieu of same-sex marriages. <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/francis-explains-who-am-i-judge" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Months into his papacy, </a>he was famously quoted as saying: &#8220;If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">However, Francis&#160;has repeatedly condemned same-sex marriage during his time as Pope &#8212; emphasizing the Catholic dictum of marriage remaining between a man and a woman in multiple statements.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He has supported anti-marriage equality laws in Slovenia and Slovakia, <a href="https://www.newwaysministry.org/resources/pope-francis-lgbt-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">per New Ways</a>.&#160;Last year,&#160;the Catholic Church issued a document essentially <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/10/catholic-church-rejects-transgender-identity-first-statement/1408695001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">condemning transgender identities and non-heterosexual relationships.</a>&#160;</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">What could this mean for LGBTQ legal rights in America?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The timing of his statement&#160;arrives at a critical juncture for LGBTQ rights in the United States.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Earlier this month, two Supreme Court Justices vehemently condemned same-sex marriage in a rebuke of Obergefell v.

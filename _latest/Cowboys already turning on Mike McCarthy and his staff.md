<div><p>Mike McCarthy has lost his starting quarterback and he may be losing his locker room, too.</p>
<p>The first-year Cowboys coach couldn&#8217;t have scripted a worse start. His team is 2-4, his defense is a disaster, Dak Prescott is out for the season and now unnamed players are criticizing his staff.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SlaterNFL/status/1318610457125675008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One player told NFL Network</a> the staff is &#8220;totally unprepared. They don&#8217;t teach. They don&#8217;t have any sense of adjusting on the fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said: &#8220;they just aren&#8217;t good at their jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s getting late early in Dallas <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/cowboys-look-lost-without-dak-prescott-in-humiliating-loss-to-cardinals/">after the ugly 38-10 Monday night loss to the Cardinals.</a> Without Prescott, they can no longer count on the offense to bail out the terrible defense, which has allowed at least 34 points in five of its games. There is some good news: The Cowboys next two games are against Washington and the Eagles. If anyone can help fix Dallas, it is the brutal NFC East.</p>

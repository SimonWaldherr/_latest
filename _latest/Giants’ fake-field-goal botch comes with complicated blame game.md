The fake field goal that should have resulted in a touchdown pass from punter/holder Riley Dixon to tight end Evan Engram in the 37-34 loss to the Cowboys was called back by a penalty when the Giants were called for an illegal shift on Cam Fleming.

“We just weren’t set as a unit right there and that’s not one person,’’ head coach Joe Judge said. “That ties into a couple of different things communication-wise and execution-wise.’’

Former Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes on The Post’s “Blue Rush” podcast said it is the responsibility of Riley — the holder for field goals who fills the role of the quarterback on the play — to make sure his line is set before calling for the ball to be snapped.

“Cam Fleming caught a lot of heat — this is about Riley Dixon,’’ Tynes said. “He needs to make sure everyone is set. Listen, Riley Dixon is not under center and he’s not behind the line very much calling pays or a cadence. He jumped the gun a little bit. He saw Evan Engram out there, he knew it was gonna work and he jumped the gun and he just snapped it a millisecond too fast.’’

WR Sterling Shepard has missed three games with a turf-toe injury and is eligible to come off injured reserve this week. It is not believed he will be ready to do so.

“I’ve got to take a look at him in practice,’’ Judge said. “I know he’s made a lot of progress on a weekly basis. We’ll get him moving around a little bit this week with the trainers early on and see where that’s gonna lead as far as him going into practice.’’

The offensive pass interference call on Damion Ratley that negated a 31-yard touchdown reception for Darius Slayton? After looking at the film, Judge did not go there, as far as complaining about the flag

“We’ve got to execute cleaner and better and not give an official any opportunity to affect the game,’’ he said.

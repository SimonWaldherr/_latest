  NBA Reportedly Focusing on Martin Luther King Jr. Day for Season Start 
description: > 
  John Amis/Associated PressThe NBA's 2020-21 season may open on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, according to Yahoo Sports' Vincent Goodwill.Goodwill reports the league is "focusing" on the holiday, January 18, for opening night, though a potential Christmas Day start isn't out of the question yet.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is expected to focus on getting next season started during a Board of Governors call Friday.A Jan. 18 start would give teams at least two months of notice if it's approved in a timely manner.Before the pandemic shut the NBA down in March, many were openly campaigning to start the season on Christmas Day permanently, largely to avoid conflict with the NFLâ€™s season.

Phillip Schofield has revealed he once forced his driver to turn around while on the way to film This Morning after refusing to appear on the show while struggling with his sexuality.

The TV presenter, 58, has opened up about his struggles in his new memoir Life Is What You Make It, where he detailed how he ran off set to vomit during the darkest days of hiding his secret.

Phil explained how he contacted his wife of 27 years Stephanie Lowe to tell her he couldn't film the show that day, as she was the only person who knew about his hidden sexuality at the time.

Detailing his decision to pull out of filming, he said: 'I sat alone in the flat, staring at the walls, as This Morning started on the other side of London. It was a very stupid thing to do... all my closest friends knew how ragged my head was but no one except Steph knew why.'

Phil said he realised he needed to seek professional help when he had to dash off set to throw up, while he also began taking prescription medication in order to cope.

The This Morning host made the decision to come out earlier this year as he shared an emotional Instagram statement with his followers, before being interviewed by co-host Holly Willoughby just moments later.

Explaining the turmoil that led to his pubic coming out interview, Phil revealed he 'sobbed quietly in the dark' while watching the New Year's Eve fireworks just weeks prior.

While he would tell colleagues his weekend was 'fine', Phil admitted the reality was he would stare at the flames in the fire and 'wish they were consuming him', as he detailed some of the dark places his mind went to.

In the autobiography, Phil revealed he became 'increasingly aware' of his sexuality over the past five years, and his wife was made aware at the same time.

He also confided in his two daughters Molly, 27, and Ruby, 24, but claimed he 'felt sick' before opening up to them about his sexuality.

Phil insisted he 'unequivocally' did not know he was gay and wouldn't have got married to Steph if he did.

Another person who supported him wholeheartedly was his friend and colleague Holly, who was the first person he told at work.

Phil invited Holly to his dressing room to talk about it after Holly grew suspicious and increasingly worried, and after their chat they saw a white feather on the floor outside the dressing room.

Phil recalled: 'She picked it up and gave it to me, and she said "see it's all going to be okay." The feather is still in my wallet.'

On Wednesday Phillip told how the support Holly gave him when he came out as gay was 'absolutely vital'.

Speaking on BBC's The One Show, Phillip admitted Holly was the first person at work he told about his sexuality and he met up with her in a London bar to discuss how they would handle his coming out on the show.

He said: '[Holly was] absolutely vital, couldn't have done it with anyone else, I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to be sat beside me.

'We had a big lead up, Holly was one of the first people I told when I knew what I had to do, she is such a wise person.

'She has got such a calm sensitive aura to her, at home everyone was saying it'll be fine and Holly was saying at work, "it'll be fine", she was the only one that knew at that time at work.'

Phillip admitted he knew there would be a 'massive amount of scrutiny' on him after he came out.

He said: 'We had to figure out how to do something like that, it had to bHone public. I knew there would be a massive amount of scrutiny.

'I said to Holly: "I'll do it on a Thursday morning and then ill go and you carry on," and we were in a bar in London secretly having this meeting and she said: "Are you joking? There's no chance that you leave and I carry on."

'She said: "No, we'll do it on a Friday and ask Ruth and Eamonn if we can knick 10 minutes from their show, so we do it and then both leave together." '

In April, Phillip moved out of the £2 million modern rustic property near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire and is living in a central London apartment where he commutes to ITV’s White City studios.

The presenter, who shares Molly, 27, and Ruby, 24, with Stephanie, previously revealed he had been leading the 'perfect life' after getting married and raising his two children, claiming he hadn't wanted anything to get in the way of his happiness.

But he said he was 'naive' to think he could suppress his sexuality when he married Stephanie 27 years ago, and he didn't consider his sexuality as it was such a 'joyous time' for him.

Phillip also admitted he battled depression as he struggled with his sexuality, and even sought therapy to come to terms with it, before deciding he found it more helpful speaking to friends in private.

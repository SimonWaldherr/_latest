The New York Jets sent their players and coaches home Friday morning, after one of their players registered a presumptive positive during daily testing for COVID-19.

And they spent much of the day suspended in uncertainty, working remotely to prepare for a game that was less than 48 hours away that was potentially in jeopardy of not being played.

But Friday night, after extensive retesting at their facility, the Jets announced that test results for all players and personnel had come back negative. The presumptive-positive turned out to be a false positive, and Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals at MetLife Stadium remains set to be played as scheduled.

"This evening, we received negative PCR COVID-19 test results for all players, coaches and personnel," the Jets said in a statement Friday nigh.

"Following a presumptive positive COVID-19 test and out of an abundance of caution to ensure everyone’s health and safety, we sent all players and personnel home this morning. We also initiated all NFL mandated protocols including player isolation, subsequent testing, and contact tracing.

"As we have thus far, we will continue to follow required health and safety protocols in the best interests of our coaches, players, staff and community. We look forward to our game this Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals."

The Jets were scheduled to take the practice field at around noon ET on Friday, for their final session before the Cardinals game. But about two hours before the appointed time, reports began to emerge that the Jets had been sent home.

Head coach Adam Gase's scheduled 11:10 a.m. news conference was postponed, and reporters were told to not come to team’s facility.

There were concerns that the Jets were about to join the growing ranks of NFL teams to potentially have their game schedule impacted by COVID-19. But there was also hope that if the test was positive, it would be isolated. And plans were made to continue on as normal.

The Cardinals practiced in Arizona, and kept their plans to board a flight early Friday evening to New Jersey.

"As of now, it's business as usual," Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury said Friday after practice. "We're heading out today and getting ready to play on Sunday until told otherwise."

<div><p>The grandparents and grandson <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/granny-shoved-onto-subway-tracks-during-fight-on-nyc-platform/">attacked at a Brooklyn subway station</a> this week were left with swollen faces and needed stitches after the brutal attack that ended with the suspect shoving the elderly woman onto the tracks, their family said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The attack unfolded around 1:45 p.m. Monday when Bi He, 73, husband Ren Bao, 82, and grandson Henry Cheng, 30, were inside the C train&#8217;s Clinton-Washington stop together.</p>
<p>Henry Cheng had asked a man to stop smoking on the subway platform, according to police.</p>
<p>In turn, the man charged at him and punched him repeatedly in the face. He also hit Bao when he tried to step in, cops said.</p>
<p>The grandma attempted to pull the man off her grandson, but he shoved her onto the tracks, according to police.</p>
<p>Luckily, she was not hit as a train pulled into the station.</p>
<p>The grandfather is now at home but the grandmother and grandson are still at the hospital, the couple&#8217;s daughter, Ren Cheng, said in Mandarin as her son, Alvin Cheng, translated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their entire faces are swollen,&#8221; she said, adding that her father and son got stitches in their faces.</p>
<p>One of her mother&#8217;s feet &#8220;looked twisted,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said it might be broken,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

 
	<p>Her father was &#8220;really, really upset&#8221; over the incident, and asked, &#8220;How could someone do something like this?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Alvin said he&#8217;s &#8220;never been too worried&#8221; for their safety, until this &#8220;heinous&#8221; incident happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was pretty mad in terms of what happened and how it happened, especially because my grandparents were involved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It hit a little harder just because of their age. When I found out about my grandmother, that part especially hit me the most because she almost got hit as she fell on the tracks. I felt a little better knowing the train stopped pretty far away.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said his grandmother might need surgery and his brother, Henry, is &#8220;relatively fine.&#8221;</p>

 
	<p>He added that he isn&#8217;t surprised Henry spoke up if the smoke was bothering his grandparents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing my brother, he cares a lot, especially because [it&#8217;s] my mom&#8217;s parents,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If it involves our grandparents, he would definitely say something.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the attacker, he said, &#8220;I would tell them to turn themselves in, but I have other words that wouldn&#8217;t be too friendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/nypd-releases-photo-of-suspect-who-shoved-a-grandma-onto-mta-tracks/">released surveillance images</a> of the suspect Tuesday morning.</p>

Los Angeles Lakers All-Star Anthony Davis plans to opt out of the final year of his contract and re-sign with the franchise, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.

The person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about Davis’ decision.

Davis, who joined the Lakers in the summer of 2019, is coming off his first NBA championship in which he averaged 25 points, 10.7 rebounds, 3.2 assists, two blocks and 1.3 steals and shot 57.1% from the field, 42.1% on 3-pointers and 93.8% on foul shots during the NBA Finals.

He was an All-NBA first-team selection this season, too. Davis, 27, and LeBron James formed a strong 1-2 combination, and the Lakers want to keep that pairing together for at least a few more seasons.

Davis’ decision to opt out of the final season of his deal worth $28.7 million in 2020-21 is not unexpected. He can re-sign with the Lakers at $32.7 million for next season if the salary cap remains at $109 million.

It is unknown though what the salary cap will be for next season as the league conducts its accounting on the 2019-20 season, which suffered losses due to the China controversy and COVID-19. The league is trying to keep it close to the projected $109 million.

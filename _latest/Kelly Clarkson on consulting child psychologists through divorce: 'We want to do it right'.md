Kelly Clarkson is continuing to open up about her divorce from Brandon Blackstock.

In an interview with ExtraTV published Monday, the "Voice" coach discussed the couple's split, revealing that she's consulted mental health professionals through the process.

"We have a lot of help as far as therapists or child psychologists, 'cause we want to do it right," she said. "I definitely want to do it right. Everyone’s sad, and it’s OK to be sad."

Clarkson and Blackstock, who married in 2013, share daughter River, 6, and son Remington, 4. Blackstock also has two children from a previous marriage. On June 4, the singer filed court papers in Los Angeles to end the marriage under her married name, Kelly Blackstock, according to the Associated Press.

During her interview with ExtraTV, Clarkson also opened up about staying candid about her personal life with her fans.

"It’s a very hard thing to navigate, to be able to be honest and share your story so maybe you can help someone else. But at the same time (you're) protecting these little kids that you adore, and they're the most important thing to you."

During the Season 2 premiere of "The Kelly Clarkson Show" in September, the singer took some time to briefly address her divorce, suggesting the split came as a surprise.

"2020 has brought a lot of change also to my personal life," Clarkson said. "Definitely didn't see anything coming that came."

On her show, Clarkson added that her divorce has been difficult because it also involves her children.

"What I'm dealing with is hard because it involves more than just my heart," she said. "It involves a lot of little hearts. We have four kids, and divorce is never easy. We're both from divorced families, so we know the best thing here is to protect our children and their little hearts."

Though Clarkson is usually open about her personal life, she said she plans to keep talk of her divorce to a minimum.

"I will talk a little bit here and there about how it affects me personally, but probably won't go too far into it because, you know, I'm a mama bear and my kids come first, although I do love you all," she said.

However, Clarkson assured fans that she is fine.

"But I am OK," she said. "I know a lot of you at home, unfortunately, have probably been through it, either as a kid or just as yourself in your own relationships.

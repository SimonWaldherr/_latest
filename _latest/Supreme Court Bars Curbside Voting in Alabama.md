  Supreme Court Bars Curbside Voting in Alabama 
description: > 
  Judge Abdul K. Kallon of the Federal District Court in Birmingham agreed, ruling last month that counties may, if they chose to, use curbside voting.“Curbside, or drive-up, voting is a form of in-person voting (which state law of course permits),” Judge Kallon wrote.“Some level of risk is inherent in life and in voting, pandemic or no,” his brief said, adding that Judge Kallon’s ruling had left several questions unanswered.“For instance,” his brief said, “how will local election officials who wish to experiment with curbside voting ensure that it is done in a manner that preserves ballot secrecy?How will they acquire the extra equipment necessary to implement curbside voting?

<div><p>A leading infectious disease expert in the US has warned that the coming weeks &#8220;are going to be the darkest&#8221; of the entire coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says the US is seeing a fresh surge in cases while awaiting a vaccine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do have vaccines and therapeutics<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/hhs-secretary-covid-19-vaccine-treatment-may-be-weeks-away/"> coming down the pike</a>, but when you actually look at the time period for that, the next six to 12 weeks are going to be the darkest of the entire pandemic,&#8221; he warned Sunday on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press-full-episodes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccines will not become available in any meaningful way until early to [the] third quarter of next year. And even then, half of the U.S. population at this point is <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/us-scientists-worry-as-more-say-theyll-refuse-covid-19-vaccine/">skeptical even taking the vaccine</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Osterholm stressed that although the US wants to achieve herd immunity, &#8220;we don&#8217;t want to get there through disease &#8212; we want to get there through a vaccination program.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted how large swaths of the US were already suffering a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/kansas-city-may-become-next-new-york-amid-covid-19-surge/">second wave of cases</a>, one that will only worsen in the approach to the holiday season.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was on this show last, September 13, we had 33,000 cases reported that day,&#8221; Osterholm told host Chuck Todd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friday we had 70,000 cases, matching the largest number we had seen back during the really serious peak in July. That number &#8212; we&#8217;re going to blow right through that. And between now and the holidays, we will see numbers much much larger.&#8221;</p>
<p>It means making tough decisions for many to stay home during the holidays, noting &#8220;far too many&#8221; cases of family get-togethers where &#8220;someone brings the virus into the household unknowingly, and then four weeks later one or more of the family members are dead.&#8221;</p>

 
	<p>&#8220;This is our COVID year. Let&#8217;s accept it. It&#8217;s not like last year, and it&#8217;s not hopefully going to be like next year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if you really love the people that you have in your immediate family &#8230; do them the greatest gift of all, and that is distance yourself this year and don&#8217;t expose them.&#8221;</p>

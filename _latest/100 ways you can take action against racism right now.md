Address racism and microaggressions at home with family, friends</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The key way to be antiracist is to name, interrupt, and counter racist ideas and actions in our everyday lives,"&#160;Dr. Amanda Taylor, senior adjunct professorial lecturer, School of International Service at American University, told USA TODAY.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>67. Tips for calling out family and friends in person</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://www.amnesty.org.au/tell-someone-love-theyre-racist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Amnesty International</a> suggests using "I" statements when confronting a family member or friend. "Rather than saying &#8216;You&#8217;re a racist,&#8217;&#160;talk about how those comments are impacting you and how you are feeling about it,&#8221; their website states. They also suggest&#160;clarifying the&#160;other person's stance, talking to them quietly and not getting too aggressive, which may lessen&#160;the effectiveness of you "persuasive powers."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>68. Tips for calling out family and friends online</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://www.amnesty.org.au/tell-someone-love-theyre-racist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Amnesty International</a>&#160;has a couple of suggestions for dealing with racists online, which include "Deleting or blocking them," "sharing a link that explains the holes in their views" or "taking a similar approach to the tips above for real-life conversations."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>69. Influence people in your group</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It's great to call people out on racist comments, but don't stop there. You can also preemptively help educate others by talking to people in your own life about how systems of oppression&#160;affect marginalized groups.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>70. Demand change from&#160;brands</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Your wallet can be your power when it comes to taking action. For-profit brands need customers to make revenue, so using your purchasing power and your platform on social media and with reviews&#160;are ways to push brands into enacting change you would like to see.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>71. Question the media outlets you read</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Are media outlets sharing statements of solidarity but not actually contributing to diverse newsrooms? As readers, you can question and share your opinions and concerns on the content provided. Sharing&#160;job postings and internship opportunities within your communities also helps give more people the chance to make their voices part of a larger outlet.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>72. Understand privilege</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It is also important, as white people, for us to remember that we will never 'get it.' We are all subject to racist ideas and we will never fully understand the experience of our Black community members, no matter how much we read, study, think or learn, or how many Black friends we have, or even if we have Black romantic partners or children," Taylor said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>73. Question yourself about privilege</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In order to understand privilege, you can ask yourself questions. For example, were you ever called names because of your race, class, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation? Also consider your own possible racial biases, which may be implicit even though you think you are being open-minded.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>74. Actively acknowledge and support members of the LGBTQ+ communities</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Part of the movements and protests is to create space for all marginalized people to share their voices, especially for Black people who also identify as LGBTQ+. Making space,&#160;amplifying those voices and defending people in LGBTQ+ communities is multifaceted,&#160;whether that's having honest conversations with those closest to you or supporting organizations and brands that provide safe spaces.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>75. Do the research&#160;</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It is equally vital that all of us, and white folks, in particular, do the ongoing personal work to read and educate ourselves on the ways that racism shows up in our own lives, neighborhoods, schools, and communities," Taylor said. Research your state's civil rights history to be better informed about your community's legacy and racial roots.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>76. Avoid being silent</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Particularly white people who want to be allies, stop it, call it out. Say, &#8216;That&#8217;s not funny.&#8217; Silence looks a lot like complicity," Associate Professor of Criminal Justice, Director of the Center for Advanced Policing and Assistant Provost of Diversity and Inclusion at the University of New Haven Lorenzo Boyd&#160;told USA TODAY. "You have to physically say, 'That&#8217;s not cool, you can&#8217;t say that.&#8217; &#8220;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>77. Accept you'll make mistakes and apologize</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Recognize that you might mess up, and if you do, apologize sincerely, and keep learning and growing," Taylor said. Be mindful of questioning something considered prejudiced or racist. Doing so does not promote discussion, but instead undermines historic personal pain.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>78. Avoid commenting on character traits</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>&#160;</strong>&#8220;I can&#8217;t change my eyes or my hair or my skin color, or to some extent my weight or my height, so things that are physical traits or character traits, we shouldn&#8217;t be commenting on. We can talk about behavior," Boyd says.&#160;For example, we no longer say, &#8220;She&#8217;s just blond. Or, she&#8217;s having a blond&#160;moment," Boyd explains.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>79. Don't perform&#160;antiracism</strong>&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#160;"For my white friends and colleagues, in particular, I think it is really important for us to be sure we are not performing antiracism," Taylor explained. "Antiracism and allyship are not badges or identities, or about woke-looking T-shirts or passionate posts on social media. Rather, antiracism is a series of intentional and ongoing actions."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Support Black-owned businesses</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>80.&#160;Actively seek out Black businesses to support</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The first way to support Black-owned businesses is to actively work on finding them and frequenting them. <a href="https://officialblackwallstreet.com/app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">The Official Black Wallstreet app</a> helps businesses gain exposure and gives people an easy way to search for companies.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>81.

For example,&#160;&#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re amazingly articulate for a Black guy.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;The covert racism I think could be more problematic. When people are overtly racist, we see them. I see the guy wearing the KKK outfit," Boyd explains. "The covert racism often masks itself as, &#8216;We&#8217;re friends but when you&#8217;re not here &#8230;&#8217; (so it&#8217;s) a false sense of security.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Taylor added, "As white people, we don&#8217;t have to have active feelings of hate in our hearts in order to be engaging in racist behavior. Even when we have good intentions, we can still cause racial harm. In other words, we don&#8217;t have to be 'bad people'&#160;to be engaging in racism."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>95.

"Little Fires Everywhere" on Hulu and "Watchmen" on HBO both weave race and generational inherited trauma&#160;into their tales of justice.&#160;For lighter fare, Issa Rae's HBO comedy "Insecure" shares a slice-of-life look at a group of Black women in Los Angeles and their triumphs and struggles. The 1997 miniseries&#160;"Roots" is based on Alex Haley's 1976 novel "Roots: The Saga of an American Family."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>98.

I&#8217;m not talking censoring, people have a right to see, but the people who share it because of its shock value.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>100.

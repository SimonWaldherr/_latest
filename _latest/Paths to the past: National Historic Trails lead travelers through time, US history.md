Since much of the original route was along waterways, it allows travelers to float wild and scenic rivers. &#8220;It&#8217;s sometimes called the journey that opened the American West,&#8221; Berger says. (Note: The visitor's center in Omaha, Nebraska is temporarily closed due to COVID-19.)</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>More information:&#160;</strong>&#160;<a href="https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">nps.gov/lecl</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</h2><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Fort Osage National Historic Landmark is an important stop along the Santa Fe Trail."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Stretching 1,200 miles across five states, this route brought American traders to the edge of the Spanish empire until it was eventually eclipsed by railroads.

The series of migration paths are among the most documented in the National Historic Trail system, Berger says, with scores of museums, monuments, parks and markers along the routes. Today, the Cherokee are the largest of the nation&#8217;s federally recognized tribes, with most in Oklahoma and a smaller contingent who evaded relocation in the southeast.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>More information:&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">nps.gov/trte/</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Juan Bautista de Anza&#160;National Historic Trail, Arizona and California</h2><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="These metal sculptures located a few miles outside of Borrego Springs, California, commemorate the settlers who headed from New Spain (now Mexico) to San Francisco Bay."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This route commemorating the settlement of San Francisco Bay is one of several trails linked to southwestern settlement and trade.

In total, it includes more than 2,000 miles of shoreline. Smith, who sailed to America in 1607, was a larger-than-life personality. A former pirate, slave and mercenary, he developed Jamestown, Virginia, and explored the Bay and its tributaries, creating detailed maps of the region. &#8220;His biography, you couldn&#8217;t make up,&#8221; Berger says.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>More information:&#160;</strong><a href="http://nps.gov/cajo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">nps.gov/cajo</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Oregon National Historic Trail</h2><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="For old-school video game players, the sight of a covered wagon and the words &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; bring about thoughts of dying of dysentery.

England, Wales and Scotland are among nations with the highest numbers of excess deaths as a result of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a new study has found.

The research, led by Imperial College London, analysed weekly death data from 19 European countries, Australia, and New Zealand, between mid-February and end of May.

The results, published in the journal Nature Medicine, showed England and Wales and Spain experienced the largest increase in mortality, with nearly 100 excess deaths per 100,000 people.

According to the researchers, this is an increase of 37% for England and Wales and 38% for Spain, when compared to how many deaths would have been expected without the pandemic.

In Scotland, the excess death deaths rate was 84 per 100,000 people during the first wave, which is a 28% increase from average expected deaths.

Elsewhere, Liverpool could surpass the peak of its first coronavirus wave within 10 days, and its hospitalâ€™s intensive care beds are already at 90 per cent capacity, according to a council leader.

Paul Brant, cabinet member for adult health and social care at Liverpool City Council, said: "Our intensive, critical care beds are filling up very fast."

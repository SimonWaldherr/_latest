He&#8217;s Bertie Wooster, for heaven&#8217;s sake. He&#8217;s infallible medic Dr Gregory House. He&#8217;s dim-but-noble Lieutenant George in Blackadder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even when he&#8217;s being an international villain in John le Carre&#8217;s The Night Manager, you couldn&#8217;t imagine buying a bazooka from a nicer arms dealer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thus Hugh is an inspired choice to play corrupt government minister Peter Laurence in Sir David Hare&#8217;s four-part political drama Roadkill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the Beeb, and Hare is an avowed middle-class socialist, so of course Laurence is a Conservative who is secretly planning to sell off the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We should be grateful that Sir David is so restrained &#8211; he probably believes Tory politicians eat roasted puppies served by slaves wearing garlands and loincloths at their private drinking clubs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With any actor less likeable than Hugh, this story would be unbearably cynical.</p><img id="i-f84b6b795cf975d3" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="With any actor less likeable than Hugh Laurie, this story would be unbearably cynical, writes Christopher Stevens as he reviews the pilot episode of the BBC's political drama Roadkill" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f84b6b795cf975d3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/22/34545960-8853337-image-a-48_1603056543580.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="With any actor less likeable than Hugh Laurie, this story would be unbearably cynical, writes Christopher Stevens as he reviews the pilot episode of the BBC's political drama Roadkill" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">With any actor less likeable than Hugh Laurie, this story would be unbearably cynical, writes Christopher Stevens as he reviews the pilot episode of the BBC's political drama Roadkill </p><p class="vjs-video-container vjs-fixed vjs-span-two-col tvshowbiz" id="v-3511118299649034681">    </p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone lies, everyone betrays each other. The Westminster plotters are venal, the journalists are cut-throats and the rest are trading secrets like street-corner drug dealers. Ruin for any marriage or career is just a phone call away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laurence himself spends the first episode lying in court to win a libel trial, sleeping with his mistress (we haven&#8217;t met his wife yet, because he never bothers to call her) and burying evidence of an unknown love child.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As part of the cover-up, he visits a women&#8217;s prison to negotiate with a potential blackmailer. When he hears later that riots have broken out at the jail, he mutters:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;Let&#8217;s hope there are injuries. Better still, fatalities.&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such pathological nastiness can never be forgivable, and it&#8217;s inevitable that Laurence will be destroyed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This isn&#8217;t one&#160;of those political soap operas, like House Of Cards, where we love to see the villain rewarded for his wickedness. The minister is destined to be, in his own words, &#8216;roadkill&#8217; &#8211; scraped off the tarmac and devoured with a garnish by his enemies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But until his inevitable demise, we&#8217;ll watch and even sympathise, because Sir David expertly shows us the man&#8217;s charming facade as well as his cold, hard core.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peter Laurence possesses the knack of making himself liked with a couple of words. He has the common touch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When his ministerial car is restored to him following his court case, we guess how much it means to him, since he despises taxis. But it&#8217;s the chauffeur, not the limo, that he greets with a delighted cry, like an alcoholic spying a fridge full of Stella in the desert &#8211; &#8216;I&#8217;ve got Sydney back. Everything&#8217;s well with the world.&#8217;</p><img id="i-525056a220c9aa79" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="Helen McCrory, pictured, is at her best playing PM Dawn Ellison as part Margaret Thatcher" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-525056a220c9aa79" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/22/34545968-8853337-image-a-49_1603056908009.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Helen McCrory, pictured, is at her best playing PM Dawn Ellison as part Margaret Thatcher" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Helen McCrory, pictured, is at her best playing PM Dawn Ellison as part Margaret Thatcher</p><p class="vjs-video-container vjs-fixed vjs-span-two-col tvshowbiz" id="v-6577757614434568080">    </p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">That&#8217;s what is meant by &#8216;populism&#8217;: the ability to make people want to please you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He could have slid silently into the back seat, luxuriating in the leather upholstery, and everyone would have hated him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, he recognises faces, remembers names. He even thanks the star-struck tourists who beg him to pose for a selfie in the streets. One clever sequence showed us exactly what the public love about</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laurence, as he fielded questions on his night-time talk radio slot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In reality, Cabinet ministers don&#8217;t have radio shows &#8211; that&#8217;s a privilege reserved for maverick backbenchers and government rebels. But it isn&#8217;t too much of a stretch, and it gives us a chance to see the schmoozer in action, fending off compliments and skewering critics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Charm&#160;won&#8217;t save him from his past. When Laurence learns he might have a child by a mother he doesn&#8217;t even remember, he isn&#8217;t surprised. He was young and rich in the Nineties, after all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That airy attitude doesn&#8217;t help in the 2020s. &#8216;In your days sex was liberation,&#8217; warns his assistant darkly. &#8216;Now it&#8217;s exploitation.&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His colleagues don&#8217;t trust him, because Laurence is a self-made man. The Prime Minister read his file like a woman scanning the list of poisonous side-effects from a new coronavirus wonder-drug, shuddering: &#8216;Retail... retail... property...&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It recalled the way that patrician politician Alan Clark dismissed another self-made Tory, Michael Heseltine, as &#8216;a man who has had to buy all his own furniture&#8217;.</p><img id="i-de96b0975883cdef" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="633" alt="Episode 2 of Roadkill, starring Hugh Laurie (pictured) is available to stream on BBC iplayer" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-de96b0975883cdef" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/00/34545972-8853337-Episode_2_of_Roadkill_starring_Hugh_Laurie_pictured_is_available-a-1_1603065304160.jpg" height="422" width="633" alt="Episode 2 of Roadkill, starring Hugh Laurie (pictured) is available to stream on BBC iplayer" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Episode 2 of Roadkill, starring Hugh Laurie (pictured) is available to stream on BBC iplayer</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Helen McCrory is at her best playing PM Dawn Ellison as part Margaret Thatcher, part Peaky Blinder.

With those two in cahoots, no one stands as much chance as a hedgehog crossing Spaghetti Junction.&#160;</p></div>

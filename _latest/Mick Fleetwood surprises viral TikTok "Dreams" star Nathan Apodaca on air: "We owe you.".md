All of Nathan Apodaca's "dreams" are coming true this week. Mick Fleetwood, co-founder of the legendary band Fleetwood Mac, surprised the TikTok star on air Friday to thank him for his viral video.

Apodaca's TikTok, which featured him skateboarding while drinking cranberry juice and singing along to Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams," has garnered over 38 million views on the platform. Fleetwood has already recreated the video himself, and Ocean Spray gifted Apodaca a truck.

The video helped the iconic 1977 hit song have its biggest-ever week on streaming services. BBC News brought the two men together during a surprise interview on Friday.

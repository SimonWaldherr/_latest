Melania Trump issued a major update on her health Wednesday, noting she has recovered and tested negative for COVID but revealing Barron Trump was positive for the disease in a second round of testing.

The first lady has not been seen in public since the White House announced almost two weeks ago she and President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus.

Her office originally said Barron, 14, tested negative for the virus, but Melania revealed on Wednesday that he ended up with a positive diagnosis even as he showed no symptoms and has since tested negative.

'Naturally my mind went immediately to our son,' she said of her thoughts after the first couple tested positive at the beginning of the month.

'To our great relief he tested negative, but again, as so many parents have thought over the past several months, I couldn’t help but think “what about tomorrow or the next day?”. My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms,' she noted.

He is now negative for COVID.

'In one way I was glad the three of us went through this at the same time so we could take care of one another and spend time together. He has since tested negative,' she said in a nearly 700-word personal essay about her experience battling COVID, entitled 'My personal experience with COVID-19.'

Barron Trump was last seen in public at the White House on August 27, when his father accepted the Republican Party's nomination for a second term. It's not unusual to go months without seeing the president's youngest child as Melania Trump keeps him out of public view as much as she can.

President Trump, upon leaving the White House on Wednesday for a campaign rally in Des Moines, said Barron is doing 'fine.'

While the president has returned to work and a heavy campaign schedule, the notoriously private first lady gave no indication of when she will resume her public life in the update she released Wednesday.

She did address the 'negative energy' in the country with less than three weeks to go until Election Day, thanked the country for their prayers and said the first family was offering prayers to all in return.

Unlike the president, Melania Trump didn't check into the hospital after her diagnosis with COVID. She said she had minimal symptoms but admitted it hit her like a 'roller coaster.'

She also said she treated herself with a 'natural route' - opting for vitamins and healthy food - indicating she did not take a heavy course of medication as the president did for his illness.

'I was very fortunate as my diagnosis came with minimal symptoms, though they hit me all at once and it seemed to be a roller coaster of symptoms in the days after. I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time. I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food,' Melania wrote.

President Trump was on dexamethasone, a powerful steroid which can cause insomnia, mania, mood swings, and rage. It has shown promise for treating patients with a severe case of COVID-19 who are getting supplemental oxygen.

His treatment regime also included an experimental anti-viral drug that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is testing to supply antibodies that help a patient fight the disease and the antiviral drug remdesivir.

The first lady did not mention wearing a face mask and social distancing, which doctors recommend to help fight the spread of COVID. She has touted the benefits of wearing a mask more than her husband has. She has worn face coverings in public although notably not as much when she is with the president, who is not a fan of wearing them.

Melania Trump went on to decry the negative energy in the country surrounding the election, much of it there as a result of her husband's combative tone as he runs for a second term.

'We are in unprecedented times - and with the election fast approaching, it has been easy to get caught up in so much negative energy,' she said.

She said she will resume her duties soon but gave no indication when the public may see her again - either in her role as first lady or on the campaign trail.

'I am happy to report that I have tested negative and hope to resume my duties as soon as I can,' Melania wrote.

She concluded that she is praying for the country: 'I want people to know that I understand just how fortunate my family is to have received the kind of care that we did. If you are sick, or if you have a loved one who is sick—I am thinking of you and will be thinking of you every day. I pray for our country and I pray for everyone who is grappling with COVID-19 and any other illnesses or challenges.'

Melania Trump sat in the front row of the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court - at least 12 people at that event later tested positive for COVID

Melania Trump was also with President Donald Trump at the first presidential debate in Cleveland on September 29

It's unclear how the first lady contracted the disease.

She was at the Saturday, September 26, Rose Garden announcement where President Trump formally nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. At least 12 people at that event later tested positive for COVID.

The first lady was also at the first presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 29, where she took her mask off after sitting in the audience - despite a request from the Cleveland Clinic for those in the audience to wear them.

The White House announced in the early hours of Friday, October 2, that the first couple was positive for COVID.

Melania, 50, was described as having a mild case. President Trump, 74, checked into Walter Reed Medical Center for four days on that Friday night.

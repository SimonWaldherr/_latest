In a standout moment of both town halls tonight, the mother of a trans child asked Biden a question on her daughter’s rights.

As many have pointed out, a discussion on LGBTQ+ rights in general has been notably absent in the 2020 campaign so far, but many have praised Biden for his response to the question:

Brennan Suen (@brennansuen) This awesome mom Mieke Haeck asked Joe Biden about how he'd protect her trans daughter, cited the Trump-Pence administration's rollback of trans rights pic.twitter.com/k23GTQkAKA

Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) We just got the first Transgender question in the whole damn campaign. Biden says he promises there is no reason to suggest there should be any right denied to Transpeople that is enjoyed by anyone else. Thank you!

Nadia E. Brown (@BrownPhDGirl) Holy sh*t! Joe acknowledged the high rates of deaths of Black trans women and the work of Beau Biden. This is an issue that is not getting due attention on the national level. #BidenTownHall

Hilary Buff(y): Vampire Slayer (@ItsHilaryBuff) Joe Biden is now discussing the murder of transgender women of color and how he plans to protect trans people. Again, he’s not perfect but bare minimum this is refreshing to hear.

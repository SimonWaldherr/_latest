  San Francisco Passes CAREN Act To Combat Racist 911 Calls 
description: > 
  San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a measure on Tuesday aimed at cracking down on racist 911 calls, a phenomenon that’s been increasingly documented on social media.Its name evokes the “Karen” meme, this year’s shorthand for a white woman weaponizing her privilege, usually with a heaping dose of prejudice against people of color.The ordinance was introduced by Supervisor Shamann Walton, who thanked his colleagues at Tuesday’s meeting for unanimously sponsoring it.And it wasn’t the first time something like that made waves in San Francisco.California Assemblyman Rob Bonta introduced a bill last month that would make such discriminatory 911 calls a hate crime.

  Opinion: Trump and Giuliani may be useful to Putin, but they're no idiots 
description: > 
  (CNN) President Donald Trump is a consistent creature in a lot of respects, especially when it comes to helping Russia and hurting the US.For years, Trump has engaged in behavior that makes Russian President Vladimir Putin's job of sowing discord, spreading disinformation and undermining our democracy a lot easier -- especially when Trump thinks it might benefit him.That's why new reports that US intelligence agencies warned the White House last year that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was being targeted by Russian intelligence come as no surprise.Every American should remember what this means: Trump has given Russia a free pass to attack our democracy.He has access to detailed, classified information, and the FBI alerted Trump to foreign intelligence threats back in 2016 , when he was still a candidate.

But Trump has refused to change his own behavior -- let alone tell his team to clean up their counterintelligence posture. That's why new reports that US intelligence agencies warned the White House last year that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/giuliani-biden-ukraine-russian-disinformation/2020/10/15/43158900-0ef5-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html" target="_blank">being targeted by Russian intelligence</a> come as no surprise.</p><a></a><a></a><p>US intelligence officials-- according to four former officials, cited by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/giuliani-biden-ukraine-russian-disinformation/2020/10/15/43158900-0ef5-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html" target="_blank"> Washington Post</a> as familiar with the matter-- were concerned that Giuliani, who was interacting with people linked to Russian intelligence, would act as a foot soldier in Moscow's <a href="http://www.justsecurity.org/71947/how-sen-ron-johnsons-investigation-became-an-enabler-of-russian-disinformation-part-i/" target="_blank">information warfare</a> against the US and feed misinformation back to Trump. Despite these direct warnings, however, Trump didn't tell Giuliani to cease and desist. Instead, Trump simply shrugged and kept him close.

For four years, the President has been briefed on malign Russian activities.

The Special Counsel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/full-mueller-report-pdf/index.html" target="_blank">report</a> also detailed ways Russia targeted Trump campaign officials as part of a wider influence campaign, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report did the same in even greater detail.</p><a></a><a></a><p>Last year, news reports indicated that Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/giuliani-counterintelligence-probe/index.html" target="_blank">was the subject of an FBI counterintelligence probe</a> , which reportedly looked into whether foreign governments were trying to take advantage of his business ties in Ukraine and with wealthy foreigners. While we don't know the status of this investigation, we do know one thing: If the FBI was investigating Giuliani as a potential counterintelligence risk, he should not have gone anywhere near the President or the White House. Any patriotic President would want to steer clear of an individual who could be doing double duty for a foreign government, including Russia. We also learned just this week that <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/521336-feds-investigating-if-alleged-hunter-biden-emails-connected-to" target="_blank">the FBI is now investigating</a> whether unverified emails, which the New York Post said were provided to the paper by Giuliani, about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden are linked to a foreign intelligence operation.</p><p class="read-more-gradient"></p><p class="read-more-link" id="js-body-read-more">Read More</p></div>

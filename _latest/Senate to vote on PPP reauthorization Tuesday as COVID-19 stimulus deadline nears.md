House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set the deadline&#160;for both sides to reach a deal to restore urgently needed benefits before Nov. 3, saying&#160;Sunday on ABC's "This Week," the deadline is for&#160;closing a deal before the election.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill said Monday the speaker hoped she would "have clarity on whether we will be able to pass a bill before the election" by the end of Tuesday.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., criticized&#160;Pelosi Monday over the deadlock in negotiations. The Kentucky Republican compared Pelosi to Marie Antoinette and&#160;said her role in the negotiations was obstructing Congress from passing aid.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">More:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/politics/2020/10/19/covid-stimulus-deal-what-democrats-republicans-and-trump-want/5979883002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Democrats, Republicans and Trump can't agree on a new stimulus deal</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">More:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/10/16/stimulus-deadline-extended-for-hard-reach-households/3664268001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Hard to reach households still need first stimulus money</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;No more all or nothing. No more endless posturing. One clear good thing that nobody even says they oppose,&#8221; McConnell said of&#160;the PPP legislation. &#8220;It would make a huge difference for workers, who may otherwise be laid off.&#8221;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Both sides are struggling to reach a deal just weeks before the election, with Democrats and Republicans hundreds of billions of dollars apart in their proposals and unable to resolve major policy differences on COVID-19 testing, liability protections, and school funding.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Congress last passed a comprehensive package in March, and many of the package&#8217;s provisions have since lapsed. The federal boost to unemployment benefits ran out in July, airline assistance expired in October, and Americans weathering an economic recession eagerly await another round of stimulus checks.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">President Donald Trump&#160;abruptly put an end&#160;to stimulus talks at the beginning of the month, telling Senate Republicans to instead focus on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, but has since&#160;reversed course, reopening negotiations with congressional Democrats.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The PPP loans have helped keep many small businesses afloat during the pandemic but expired Aug. 8&#160;and have&#160;not been authorized since then. Under the program, businesses with 500 or fewer workers were eligible for loans up to&#160;$10 million, which became forgivable if at least 60% of the amount is spent on payroll. The Senate's bill would restart the loan program.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Republicans in the Senate are also set to take up a $500 billion stimulus plan on Wednesday&#160;that would also reauthorize the PPP loans, reissue the federal boost to unemployment benefits, send over $100 billion to schools, and allocate funding for testing and vaccine development.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The price tag of the bill is much lower than the roughly $1.8 trillion package the White House is negotiating and the $2.2 trillion package Democrats have offered. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., the second-ranking Senate Republican, told reporters on Capitol Hill Monday "it would be hard " to get enough Republicans to support a bill at $1.8 trillion&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin spoke on the phone Monday afternoon as the two sides crawled along towards a deal. Hammill said they&#160;"continued to narrow their differences" and are set to speak again on Tuesday.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">More:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/19/covid-19-stimulus-updates-pelosi-sets-deadline-mcconnell-pushes-bill/3709406001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Will a COVID-19 relief deal be struck by Tuesday?

The U.S. has recorded more than 8 million cases of the coronavirus – more than any nation in the world.

The grim milestone comes as experts believe the country is facing another peak in its outbreak. Health officials reported over 63,000 news cases on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus tracker , making it the highest single day total in over two months. The seven-day new case average has topped 50,000.

"After a month of warning signs, this week's data makes it clear: The third surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is underway," experts from The COVID Tracking Project wrote in a recent blog .

While testing has increased, it is not enough to cover the number of new infections the country is seeing.

Seventeen states reported record high daily new cases this week, according to the project. The majority of them were in the Midwest and West, including Kansas, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, Colorado, Washington and Wyoming.

Infections are on the rise in most states, with the highest numbers coming from the Midwest and South. Hospitalizations are also increasing, with more than 37,000 people suffering from the coronavirus in hospitals as of Thursday.

President Donald Trump on Thursday night again defended his administration's response to the outbreak during a town hall, arguing – as he had done before – that the U.S. is "rounding the corner" on the pandemic. He also continued to raise skepticism about the effectiveness of mask-wearing.

A widely cited coronavirus model is predicting that the U.S. death toll from the pandemic will exceed 389,000 by February. It currently stands at over 218,000 fatalities.

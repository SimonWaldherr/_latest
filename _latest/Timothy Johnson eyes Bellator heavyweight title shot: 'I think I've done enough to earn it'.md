After notching his third straight win, Timothy Johnson wants a shot at the Bellator heavyweight title.

Johnson (15-6 MMA, 3-2 BMMA) avenged his loss to Cheick Kongo in the main event of Bellator Europe 10 on Saturday, edging out the hometown fighter by split decision at Accor Arena in Paris, France.

Johnson prevailed as an underdog once again and thinks his upset wins over the formerly unbeaten Tyrell Fortune and UFC veterans Matt Mitrione and Kong are enough to warrant a title shot against heavyweight champion Ryan Bader (27-6 MMA, 5-1 BMMA).

Speaking to reporters after his win in France, Johnson explained that, while he’s targeting a return in early 2021, he’d be willing to answer the call for a title shot at any time.

“January, February, but if they say ‘Hey, you wanna fight Ryan next week?’ I’d be like, ‘Yeah, let’s do it!'” he said. “But ideally, I’ve been training non-stop since June 28. I just got into a short, intense camp, fought Matt, took two days off, knew I was gonna fight again (and) went right back into an intense camp. My body definitely has some bumps and bruises on it, but I don’t want too long of a layoff. I’m liking what’s going on here, so a January, February fight would be great.”

He continued, “If I have to wait for Bader, I’ll do that. Like I said, I might be a little selfish right now, but I think I’ve done enough to earn it. Maybe I haven’t. Like I said, politics. MMA is kinda weird like that sometimes, but all throughout my career, I’ve been a yes man or a company man, and I’ve always said yes to everything. I think it’s not bad for me now maybe to be a ‘no’ man or a little selfish.”

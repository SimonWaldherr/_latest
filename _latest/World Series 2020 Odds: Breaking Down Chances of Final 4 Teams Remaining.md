The Houston Astros finished the season at a mediocre 29-31 and slipped into the postseason only because the American League West was a weak division and the playoff field was expanded.

Despite the fact that ace Justin Verlander and closer Roberto Osuna were sidelined by injury, the 'Stros beat the American League Central champion Minnesota Twins in the Wild Card Series. Then they did away with the Oakland Athletics in the division series.

"I know a lot of people are mad," shortstop Carlos Correa told reporters after he and his cohorts knocked out the Twinkies. "I know a lot of people don't want to see us here. But what are they gonna say now?"

The Astros are playing the heel in the wake of the sign-stealing scandal that tarnished the franchise and rocked the sport this offseason. No one aside from hardcore Houston boosters is rooting for them.

That said, manager Dusty Baker's bunch is four wins away from a World Series appearance.

The condition of Zack Greinke's arm is a question, though he did throw 4.2 innings in Game 4 of the ALDS against Oakland. And the Astros lost a 2-1 nail-biter in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series to the Tampa Bay Rays on Sunday.

Perhaps you're rooting against them. If so, you aren't alone.

But at this point, Houston's title hopes are alive and kicking...like it or not.

Odds: +700 (bet $100 to win $700)

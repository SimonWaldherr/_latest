It’s time to get the house ready for Halloween. Even though things might be different this year, that doesn’t mean you can’t turn your house into the funhouse of horrors and mischiefs. You can gather the family around and watch scary movies, make DIY costumes, have a horror beauty spa night, or have a monster-style BBQ outside in the backyard. If you prefer to keep it simple, you can always read a few scary stories with the kids, order a few subscription boxes, bake some goodies or enjoy a night of games and treats all in the comfort of your own home.

Here are 10 great ways you can celebrate Halloween at home this year.

1. Have a spa night

You and your partner or older children can have a spooky spa night and unwind together. You can paint your nails with the Sally Hansen x Sour Patch Kids limited-edition collection or some Dashing Diva Magic Press Press-On Nails. You will definitely get a kick out of the candy corn themed bath bombs from Etsy. You can decorate the bathroom and use one of our favorite humidifiers to give you the smoke effect you need to give you a ghostly feeling.

And no spa night is complete without a high-quality foot spa—our favorite is the Ivation Foot Spa Massager, which comes with massage rollers and has adjustable heating settings. Whatever you choose, just make sure you and your family are rocking some cozy and plush robes, which will be essential for setting the comfy mood.

2. Don't skimp on the outdoor decor

Turn your backyard into a Halloween fun fest with festive decor, like the inflatable Beetlejuice Sandworm, or the 12-foot Giant-Sized Skeleton with LifeEyes that's been all over the Internet recently. These decorations will turn your backyard into the ultimate spooky scene that your kids will enjoy.

3. Have a spooky slumber party

Grab some flashlights, blankets, and some glow-in-the-dark books like What Was I Scared Of? by Dr. Seuss. You can also fire up your projector and play a hand puppet game or find some ghosts to fly around on the screen. You can let the kids go a little wild with the Noshi Edible Kid Paint which is great for playing zombie games and eating fake body parts.

4. Make it a cozy movie night

Whether you want to watch something scary or something everything in the family can watch with no nightmares, a heated blanket and popcorn maker is the way to go. Encourage everyone to wear their costume during movie night so the kids can have a little more fun with it.

5. Make DIY costumes

No need to spend a lot of money on costumes for your growing kids when you can just make a fun outfit that can double as their everyday clothes. Primary is the source for all trendy, gender-neutral clothes for infants, toddlers, big kids and adults. You can turn regular clothes into funny pop culture references. The best part is that these Halloween outfits can also be part of your kid's wardrobe after Halloween which means you will save money.

6. Have a scavenger hunt

Turn your family into little scavenger hunters for the night. For the little ones, this witch piñata from Scandiborn comes ready with candy stuffed inside already. For older kids, you can scatter candy throughout the house, like an October Easter egg hunt, or lead them around with a number of clues that ultimately leads to a Halloween candy stash they can gorge on.

7. Whip up some Halloween treats

Is there anything more fun than eating spooky treats on Halloween? Scour the internet for some of the best, easy Halloween recipes you can bake along with your little ones. Even better, some of our favorite meal kits, like Home Chef, have Halloween-themed entrees you can whip up in no time. Check out the Home Chef Spooky Shephard's Pie, or these adorable healthy Halloween treats from Hello Fresh.

8. Have a photoshoot and play dress up

All you need is a good camera, some proper lighting, and adorable costumes. Have fun and be creative! Dress the little ones in shirts with funny sayings like the shirts from The Spunky Stork and Mori. Grab some props and start posing for the camera. Just remember, those images will make great holiday cards. And please—involve the pets!

9. Make it a crafting night

Turn on a Halloween playlist and get ready to create. For the school-aged kids, these Ooly Monster Erasers entertain as well as erase. You can make masks, or even offer to make each others’ outfit. Just a few supplies are needed to turn your night into a crafter’s dream.

There are also a number of Halloween-themed crafting boxes you can complete as a family from Cratejoy, like the We Craft Box, which comes with paper crafts for kids of all ages.

10. Carve a pumpkin together

There's no better family activity on Halloween than pumpkin carving. We think the Pumpkin Masters All in One carving kit is the best you can buy, as it's affordable, easy to use, and incredibly effective. Get a few pumpkins and have fun watching your kids create their own designs and play with fruity insides.

What issues do people care about most in places we don’t hear from often enough? That’s what HuffPost set out to discover last year on our Listen to America bus tour. We interviewed nearly 1,700 people (you can hear more than 300 of them in this beautiful interactive) and listened. What we heard surprised us, and informs the stories we’re telling at HuffPost today.

Heading into the 2018 election cycle, we’re going to go out and educate ourselves again. We’re out on the road for a two-week journey through five Western states (four of which we didn’t manage to visit last year) to talk about issues affecting communities in California, Nevada, Idaho, Arizona and Colorado. We’re partnered with local media organizations to produce town hall events in each location where we address an issue of specific concern. For more detail, here’s what we’re doing in Sacramento, Reno, Boise, Boulder and Phoenix. All events will be livestreamed on this page, and HuffPost’s social accounts.

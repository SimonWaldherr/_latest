Would you wear these silly sandals . . . for a Scooby snack?

Designer Matthew Williams has released his first collection as the creative director of the French fashion house Givenchy, and the standout style is his “Tryp-toe” shoe, heels that separate the toes into three groups split apart by thin loops. The sandals are paired with everything from draped tanks and trousers to strong suiting, but the way they’re styled is what’s raising eyebrows: Models are rocking them with matte tights in a well, doo-colored brown.

The look evokes a cartoonish vibe that Twitter wasn’t going to let slide. Culture vultures online are decrying the haute hoof as a dupe of Scooby-Doo’s paws.

The canine comparison was first flagged on Twitter by fashion writer Hannah Tindle, who posted a side-by-side shot of the sandal from Givenchy’s lookbook and a picture of Scooby’s haunches, and cartoonist Cathy Nolan says it’s pretty on point.

“When I teach my students how to draw paws, we basically start with an oval that we divide into thirds,” Nolan, a Williamsburg artist and Scooby superfan told The Post. “I think the shoe looks like Scooby-Doo’s paw, definitely.”

Even Williams’ other color choices for pieces in the collection scream Scooby: punchy purple pants (very Daphne), the brown stockings give the illusion of monochrome fur, and “especially the orange,” on the sandals and on a slinky scarf top, said Nolan. “There was a lot of orange in the Scooby-Doo characters like Velma’s outfit and Daphne’s orange hair.”

But while cartoon fans might immediately recognize those meddling kicks from the long-running TV show where Shaggy, his buds and Scooby pile into the Mystery Machine to go on adventures and crack cases, the split-toe style does have a history in high fashion.

Maison Marigela’s Tabi style — cloven Chelsea boot and loafer variations retail for about $1,000 — have been a fashion world staple since 1989.

Another pricey paw: Alexander McQueen’s Armadillo shoe, a gravity-defying pointed boot favored by Lady Gaga. Her now ex-fiancé Taylor Kinney spent $295,000 on three pairs for her through a Christie’s charity auction in 2015.

Indeed, McQueen, who was Givenchy’s head designer from 1996 to 2001, designed a three-toed sandal for his 1997 Givenchy fall collection which served as Williams’ inspiration.

Williams told Vogue UK this week of the head-scratching heels, “I’ve always been obsessed and now I get to do mine.”

  Opinion | The Encroachment of the Unsayable 
description: > 
  “Why is a career like that of Christopher Hitchens not only unlikely but almost unimaginable?” Packer asked.Imagine that ever running today, in Vanity Fair or any other mainstream publication.What these examples show, and what Packer brilliantly captures in his speech, is what might be called the encroachment of the unsayable.It’s an encroachment that, in its modern form, began with the Ayatollah Khomeini’s 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie for the publication of “The Satanic Verses,” which was deemed blasphemous.In short order, the world got to see who in the liberal world really had the courage of liberalism’s supposedly deepest convictions.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In January, in what now seems like a bygone age, the writer George Packer <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/packer-hitchens/605365/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delivered</a> a memorable speech, &#8220;The Enemies of Writing,&#8221; for the honor of winning the Hitchens Prize. &#8220;Why is a career like that of Christopher Hitchens not only unlikely but almost unimaginable?&#8221; Packer asked. &#8220;Put another way: Why is the current atmosphere inhospitable to it? What are the enemies of writing today?&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">For a sense of what Packer meant, consider that in 2007 Hitchens <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> &#8212; and Vanity Fair published &#8212; an essay titled, &#8220;Why Women Aren&#8217;t Funny.&#8221; It was outlandish, but also learned, and maybe not entirely serious. Imagine that ever running today, in Vanity Fair or any other mainstream publication. Or take another Hitchens column from the same year, in which he called Islam &#8220;simultaneously the ideology of insurgent violence and of certain inflexible dictatorships.&#8221; Try finding a line like that today in Slate, where it first <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2007/03/ayaan-hirsi-ali-is-no-fundamentalist.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeared.</a></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">What these examples show, and what Packer brilliantly captures in his speech, is what might be called the encroachment of the unsayable. It&#8217;s an encroachment that, in its modern form, began with the Ayatollah Khomeini&#8217;s 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie for the publication of &#8220;The Satanic Verses,&#8221; which was deemed blasphemous.

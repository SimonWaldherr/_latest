Reagan Hancock, 22, died on Friday after her unborn baby was forcibly cut out from her womb. She is pictured right with her young daughter and husband

A heavily pregnant woman has been killed along with her unborn baby in Texas, allegedly by a friend who cut the infant from her womb then took her to a hospital across state lines.

Reagan Hancock, 22, who was seven and a half months pregnant, was found by her mother in her home in New Boston, Texas, on Friday.

The woman - who already had a daughter - had had her belly cut open and the baby she was carrying removed from her womb.

Nearly 50 miles away, a female suspect was arrested in Idabel, Oklahoma, after allegedly taking the baby to a hospital. The baby has since died.

That woman has not yet been named by police but it's been claimed by Reagan's family on social media that she was a friend. Police are yet to reveal an alleged motive.

The woman has been charged with kidnapping and murdering an unborn child.

The young mom had been expecting a second child with her husband Homer, whom she married in 2019 and shared a three-year-old daughter

She had allegedly taken the fetus to a hospital in Idabel, where the baby later died, according to the news station.

Friends and family identified Hancock as the victim in social media posts and revealed she had been friends with her attacker.

A PayPal fund that was set up for the married mother-of-one in the wake of her gruesome death states Hancock 'and her unborn baby were selfishly killed by someone Reagan considered a friend.'

Reagan's mother found her body at her home in New Boston, Texas, on Friday

There was a large police presence in the quiet residential neighborhood

The post revealed the young mom had been expecting a second child with her husband Homer, whom she married in 2019 and with whom she shared a three-year-old daughter.

Social media posts show Hancock was expecting another little girl, who she planned to name Braxlynn Sage, on November 10.

In a heartbreaking post shared on Saturday, Hancock's mother revealed she was the one who discovered her daughter's body in her home.

'I am begging for prayers without ceasing for our family.

'Our beautiful daughter Reagan Hancock and her precious unborn baby girl Braxlynn were murdered yesterday by Satan in the flesh,' the mom wrote.

'I found her and Marcus and Chris were on scene right after me.

'Our family, friends, & community are rocked to the core! Our Reagan was one of the most precious people you would ever meet.'

Police said the Texas Rangers are now investigating incident.

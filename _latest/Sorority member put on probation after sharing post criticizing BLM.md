<div><p>A University of Kansas sorority has put a member on probation for &#8220;unbecoming&#8221; behavior on social media &#8212; for sharing a post criticizing Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>Sophomore Katherine Lauer shared <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/sorority-member-put-on-probation-for-conservative-social-media-posts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documents with Fox News</a> that show she was sanctioned by the college&#8217;s Kappa Alpha Theta sorority for &#8220;argumentative communication &#8230; as a result of your social media posts.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was told to take a &#8220;social media posting holiday&#8221; for a week to do a &#8220;personal reflection and cleanse&#8221; &#8212; and watch a video selected by the sorority&#8217;s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, Fox said.</p>
<p>The student said she was also ordered to monitor her online posts to &#8220;assess their alignment with the Kappa Alpha Theta online social media contract,&#8221; as well as have &#8220;open dialogue&#8221; with Kappa Alpha Theta chief operating officer Allie Dew to get a &#8220;broader education of America today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suspension was sparked by Lauer reposting a <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1308740712419274752" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message from conservative firebrand Candace Owens</a>&#160; calling Black Lives Matter &#8220;the most flagrantly racist organization in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Lives Matter is an organization of white men, using the faces of dead black people, to raise millions of dollars toward electing white Democrats into positions of power,&#8221; Owens declared in the Sept. 23 tweet.</p>
<p>Lauer told Fox that she supports the ideals of the BLM movement and was merely questioning the funding.</p>
<p>When she asked why she was being put under discretionary probation, she was told it was for &#8220;conduct unbecoming of a member of Theta .&#8221;</p>
<p>She attempted to appeal the probation in a meeting with the sorority&#8217;s advisory board on Oct. 18 &#8212; but it was overturned by the board, which pressed her to admit she benefitted from white privilege, Fox said.</p>
<p>Lauer said that other sorority sisters texted her to complain that her posts &#8212; that also included pro-life stances and ones highlighting flubs by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden &#8212; were &#8220;hurtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the sorority took no action against those posting &#8220;aggressive&#8221; attacks on President Trump and his policies, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like they&#8217;re really trying to suppress me and silence me,&#8221; Lauer told Fox.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the conservative friends that I have do not feel comfortable speaking their opinion. It&#8217;s almost like &#8230; the environment that everyone feels suppressed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Lauer is set to be &#8220;reevaluated&#8221; during a meeting next Monday.</p>
<p>The University of Kansas and the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority did not respond to Fox News&#8217; requests for comment.</p>

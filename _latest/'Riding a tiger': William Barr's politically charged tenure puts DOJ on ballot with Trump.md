  'Riding a tiger': William Barr's politically charged tenure puts DOJ on ballot with Trump 
description: > 
  Trump's comments came after the attorney general privately indicated that the Russia review, headed by Connecticut federal prosecutor John Durham, would not be released before the election."I'm not happy," Trump said, adding that it was "too early" to say whether he would retain the attorney general in a second term."Barr has been riding a tiger throughout his tenure at the Justice Department," Turley said.The attorney general claimed that Democrats were pursuing a "scorched earth, no-holds-barred resistance" meant to "sabotage" Trump's presidency."I don't know of any (attorney general) who has faced this kind of pressure," Mukasey said.

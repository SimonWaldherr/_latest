<p>Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/joe-biden-retreats-to-delaware-as-trump-stumps-through-four-states/">back at his Wilmington, Del., home</a> and will not return to the campaign trail until after his face-off with President Trump at Thursday night&#8217;s debate.</p>
<p>The former vice president landed down in his home state Sunday evening after campaigning in North Carolina, after which the Biden campaign called a lid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling a lid&#8221; refers to a candidate or campaign indicating to the press that they will not be holding anymore events, usually for the day.</p>
<p>The 2020 Democrat will be focused heavily on prepping for his second and final debate, with no public events on his schedule.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Biden campaign did not respond to The Post&#8217;s request for comment on the matter.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic hit the United States in mid-March, just after the former vice president had secured the Democratic nomination.</p>
<p>As a result, Biden was forced to begin campaigning virtually from his Delaware home, where his campaign built a television studio.</p>
<p>Biden defended himself when he took flack from Trump and Republicans for <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/27/biden-basement-lockdown-is-working-pretty-well-for-campaign/">remaining on lockdown amid the pandemic</a>, saying doing so helped his campaign, during a CNN interview in May.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this stuff about &#8216;Biden&#8217;s hidin,&#8217; well, you know, the fact of the matter is, it&#8217;s working pretty well so far, doing the rules,&#8221; the former vice president said at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s [Trump] behind in almost every &#8212; every state,&#8221; he continued, noting that he recognized that the numbers could change between then and the November election.</p>
<p>Biden was referencing his climbing poll numbers, which had shown him ahead of Trump both nationally and in key swing states.</p>
<p>The ex-VP did not begin in-person campaigning again until Labor Day, with each appearance being limited to a few dozen attendees kept at a distance for safety purposes.</p>
<p>And with his polling lead in the top Electoral College battlegrounds hovering at just under 5 percent, few Democrats are complaining about his laid-back schedule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Biden is doing exactly what he needs to do to win,&#8221; Democratic strategist Eric Koch told The Post on Sunday.</p>
<p>President Trump, meanwhile, is not letting the last 15 days of the election cycle go to waste.</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief will travel to Arizona Monday where he will hold two rallies, one in Prescott and one in Tuscon.</p>
<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, he has campaign events scheduled in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, respectively.</p>
<p>As of Monday, the president has no formal debate prep scheduled, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/19/us/trump-vs-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s vice presidential running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), will be out on the trail in Biden&#8217;s absence. On Monday, she will be in the must-win swing state of Florida.</p>

 <p>     </p> <p>"Let's have factual information given out to the public," he said.</p> <p>Questioned on what he would do to protect the livelihoods of those he had spoken about, including lower paid workers in the hospitality industry, if the government didn't offer any extra financial support at midday, he said: "The ultimatum letter that we got late last night was a little odd in that it talked about additional support.</p> <p>"But the government has never given us a figure as to what that might be."</p> <p>He added that they were expecting to write to the government to say that they need support to reflect that they had already been in lockdown restrictions for three months and stability to support the people of businesses.</p>

 <p>But Ranvir questioned: "They've got a prominent mayor in you in delaying these restrictions. Surely that gives the people of Greater Manchester the freedom to actually [think], 'If our mayor doesn't think it's imperative to go into Tier 3 right now then why should I behave in a way that means I can't mix with other households'?"</p> <p>"I've never said that I wouldn't accept Tier 3 under any circumstances," Andy pointed out. "What I've said is that if you're going to do it, you have to support people properly through it."</p> <p>Kate interjected, saying: "But Andy, people react and... don't necessarily listen to every word that we say. They form an overall impression. And you have publicly delayed - for what you believe are good reasons for the people of Manchester.</p> <p>"But the perception of people is that he's standing up to the government, he doesn't want to have this Tier 3 unless we get money. The impression will be that resistance isn't futile, that actually going out and breaking the rules because they need to put food on the table might be something that you would unconsciously approve of that."</p>

 <p>Andy conceded that there was a "risk" of that but insisted that it was a risk that the government are taking because they are the ones talking about imposing.</p> <p>"I'm trying to be constructive," Andy said. "They are the ones that set the ultimatum, not me. So I will continue talking right up to it."</p> <p>He went onto hit about suggestions that the reason he was speaking out was due to "party politics", which he objected to.</p> <p>"Politics should be about speaking out for people who don't normally get a voice," he insisted, adding that he "wouldn't make an apology to the government or anybody" for speaking for them.</p>

 <p>Kate then addressed Labour leader Keir Starmer's calls for a national two-week circuit breaker lockdown, she questioned Andy on whether he agreed it was a good idea and if he took some responsibility for bringing it upon everyone.</p> <p>"I personally think that staying in Tier 2 with the possibility of a national circuit break is the best way to go because the experts tell us that Tier 3 is not certain to bring the cases down, but a circuit breaker of that kind if certain to bring cases down," he replied. "Because it's shorter, it would create more benefits to health and less harm to the economy. So that is my position."</p> <p>But he added: "What I need to remind you, Kate, is that you're talking about cases in the south. Cases were lower in the north when we went into national lockdown earlier this year, and that is sometimes forgotten.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>"But as I pointed out on this programme at the time, that national lockdown was lifted too early for the north of England and that is why we are in the problem that we are in at the moment."</p> <p>Kate interjected, pointing out: "London's in as tight restrictions as you are about to have imposed but the mayor there has accepted similar restrictions, so it isn't just a north-south divide."</p> <p>"No, not completely and I did say earlier in the interview that this is everyone's issue," Andy replied. "We need a fair financial framework."</p> <p><strong>*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV</strong></p></div>

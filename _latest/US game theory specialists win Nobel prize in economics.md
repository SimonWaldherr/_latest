The Nobel prize for economics was awarded on Monday to two US game theory specialists, 26 years after John Nash – the Princeton academic depicted by Russell Crowe in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind – won for his groundbreaking work on the same subject.

Americans Paul R Milgrom and Robert B Wilson won for the designs of mathematical models that promote “improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats”, said Göran K Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Milgrom, 72, the Shirley and Leonard Ely professor of humanities and sciences at Stanford University, is one of the leading lights in auction theory, along with his Stanford colleague and thesis advisor Wilson, 83, the Adams distinguished professor of management.

Auction theory, which is a branch of game theory, was developed during the late 1970s and early 1980s after a group of researchers set about building mathematical models that could introduce incentives and information into the auction bidding process to maintain a fair market and prevent collusion among the bidders.

It came to prominence in the UK in the early part of the century when the government, with the support of the Oxford academic Paul Klemperer, was credited with extracting one of the largest sums obtained by any country from the big phone providers following the auction of new mobile phone spectrum.

Speaking to reporters in Stockholm by phone after learning of his win, Wilson struggled to think of an auction in which he himself had participated. But then added: “My wife points out to me that we bought ski boots on eBay. I guess that was an auction.”

John Nash developed the Nash equilibrium to analyse situations of conflict and co-operation and produce predictions about how people will behave.

Nash’s famous equilibrium has found application in fields as diverse as computing, evolutionary biology and artificial intelligence.

The award, which comes with 10m krona (£850,000) cash prize and a gold medal, caps a week of Nobel prizes and is technically known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Since its establishment in 1969, it has been awarded 51 times and is widely considered one of the Nobel prizes.

Last year’s award went to two researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a third from Harvard University for pioneering on-the-ground experiments to discover the most effective ways to tackle poverty in the developing world.

There was speculation ahead of the award that American Claudia Goldin, whose research has focused on inequality and the female labour force, would become the third woman to receive the prize.

Another contender was her compatriot Anne Krueger, formerly the number two and briefly the managing director at the International Monetary Fund, who has studied how businesses use their economic and political power to dominate markets, and is a free-trade activist.

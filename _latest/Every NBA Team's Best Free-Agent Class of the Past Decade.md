Only signing unrestricted free agents, restricted free agents or being on the receiving end of an agreed upon sign-and-trade count. Players who inked rookie or veteran extensions were not included, since no other teams had the chance to sign the player at the time.</p><p class="">While some franchises have had far better luck than others with recruiting and signing players, these are the best free-agent classes for every NBA team since 2010.</p></ol><p id="br-ad-2913364-1" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><h1>Atlanta Hawks: 2013</h1><p

years, $24 million)</li><li>PG Jeff Teague (four years, $32 million)</li><li>SF DeMarre Carroll (two years, $5 million)</li><li>PF Elton Brand (one year, $4 million)</li></ul><p class="">The Atlanta Hawks began building the core of their 60-win 2014-15 team the season before, headlined by luring Millsap from the Utah Jazz.</p><p class="">Millsap would go on to make the All-Star team all four years in Atlanta, and his original contract there was one of the decade's best values.</p><p class="">Korver and Teague would both make an All-Star appearance under these pacts, with the former leading the NBA in three-point shooting in both 2013-14 (47.2 percent) and 2014-15 (49.2 percent).</p><p class="">Carroll ended up being a terrific signing, becoming a talented perimeter defender and reliable offensive threat as the team's starting small forward.</p><p id="br-ad-2913364-2" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><h1>Boston Celtics: 2019</h1><p class="slideData">2 of 30</p><ol><p></p><img alt=""

million)</li></ul><p class="">The Boston Celtics' decade featured some big individual signings (<a href="http://bleacherreport.com/al-horford">Al Horford</a>, Gordon Hayward), but no class was as complete as last summer's.</p><p class="">After <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a> left as a free agent, getting Walker from the Charlotte Hornets helped save the season and gave Boston an All-Star at point guard.</p><p class="">While signing Kanter made more headlines, it was Theis who became the team's starting center, one who blended well Boston's talented wings and guards.</p><p class="">Wannamaker was one of the few veterans on the team, playing in all but one game and leading the NBA in free-throw shooting (92.6 percent) this past season.</p><p

year's biggest free agents, Durant and Irving could go down as one of the best classes in league history.</p><p class="">While Irving's season lasted just 20 games before he underwent shoulder surgery, he was averaging a career-high 27.4 points to go with 5.2 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.4 steals per game.</p><p class="">The Brooklyn Nets knew Durant would be out for the year while he recovered from an Achilles injury, but getting him for three healthy years at $164 million will be worth it if he even closely resembles his pre-injury self.</p><p class="">Both players took slightly less than the max to bring Jordan in, and the 32-year-old is still a solid rotation player even if Jarrett Allen should win the starting job.</p><p class="">With a healthy Irving and Durant for 2020-21, the Nets' $300 million investment should start paying dividends.</p><p id="br-ad-2913364-4" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><h1>Charlotte Hornets: 2013</h1><p class="slideData">4 of

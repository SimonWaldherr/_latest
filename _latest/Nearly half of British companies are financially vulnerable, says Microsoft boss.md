<div><p>Nearly half of British companies are financially vulnerable and unprepared for the future, according to the chief executive of the world's second most valuable company.&#160;</p>
<p>Microsoft's Satya Nadella told the Telegraph that the UK needs to focus on areas where it has key competitive advantages - including healthcare and financial services - to build an economy that will thrive after Brexit.</p>
<p>Figures compiled by the US tech firm, together with Goldsmiths, University of London, suggested that half of all UK companies are struggling to remain competitive and appeared at risk.&#160;</p>
<p>These are companies where revenue was slumping and managers were taking &#8220;too long to integrate new technology&#8221;, Microsoft said. Just over 20pc of British businesses had been forced to scrap their existing business model days after Britain entered a lockdown this year.&#160;</p>
<p>Microsoft said it was &#8220;ringing the alarm bell&#8221; amid concerns that the failure of these businesses to compete &#8220;posed a threat to Britain&#8217;s prosperity&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>Mr Nadella said the UK should be capitalising on the areas that it was already strong in to drive productivity growth.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK has a big structural advantage with the NHS,&#8221; he told the Telegraph. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t that many systems in the world which have this amount of healthcare data and real-world evidence data that can change everything that&#8217;s happening in the pharma industry all the way down to care.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said financial services was another area where the UK had a unique advantage, and could compete in an "increasingly digital world".&#160;</p>

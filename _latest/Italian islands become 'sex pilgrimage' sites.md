"So many singles who meet here for holidays end up falling in love and return to celebrate their wedding or their child's birth."</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Aristocrats and lyrical poets composed sonnets in the past hailing the erotic properties of cestrum, which dots every corner of Stromboli.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Belonging to the jasmine species, it may fool the occasional passerby. During the day it appears quite a dull plant, resembling a shrub. It is not strikingly beautiful, but when night falls it comes into its own. </p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Originally found in more tropical climates, legend has it that Italian explorer Christopher Columbus brought cestrum back from the New World and it found an ideal habitat in extremely hot spots like Stromboli.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>But most locals say it is indigenous, a "child of the volcano," and are proud of their plant's powers, also said to include Viagra-like properties.

They also offer a service taking young single ladies on a boat tour that includes touching unusually shaped rocks said to offer luck in the search for love.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Nino Terrano of I Delfini diving center says he often brings women out "to discover the ragged sea stacks that surround the isle, of the weirdest shapes and colors." </p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>"One such rock, shaped like male genitalia, is said to bring good luck: girls who stroke it will end up finding a guy, get married and have lots of kids."</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>The main highlight on the rock-caressing boat tour is La Canna, an 85-meter volcanic protrusion that juts out of the emerald sea off Filicudi's shore. Some say it resembles the head of a cobra or a rifle, but most see in it the representation of a huge phallus reaching for the sky. Its name means "rod" or "cane," and you don't need an Italian dictionary of slang to understand why.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>The spot also lures rock-climbing enthusiasts and is home to a unique lizard serpent that also sparks curiosity among visitors.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Filicudi has a primeval vibe that awakens senses and pleasure, locals insist. Older village women have been known to make fertility potions.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>"This is the island where you'll find love, no matter how or where you look for it, even if it comes at a later stage and somewhere else," says Enzo Anastasi of Hotel La Canna. "This place prepares the ground for whatever passion destiny has in store for you. After all, here's where I met and married my wife."</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>It's a place of unspoilt nature. There's only a fishing village, Pecorini a Mare, with pastel-colored houses, two little harbors and one single road that circles the island. </p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p><h3>Lovers' Cave</h3></p></p><a href="/travel/article/italy-fertility-islands/index.html?gallery=7"><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F201002141058-lovers-grotto-filicudi.jpg" alt="Lovers' grotto Filicudi"><p class="CaptionedImage__ctaText"></p></a><p class="CaptionedImage__caption">Lovers' Cave is said to be popular with amorous couples. </p><p class="CaptionedImage__credit">Silvia Marchetti</p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Steep dusty stone paths and old donkey trails connect bright dwellings with thatched terraces covered in bougainvilleas and made of white columns and maiolica benches.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Filicudi's cliffs are black, green and red with labyrinths of grottoes. Ruins of a prehistoric hamlet and ruined farm huts dot the shore.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Nino Terrano enjoys showing his guests fascinating rock patterns and playing with their imagination. Waves and sand layers have drawn colorful designs in the cliff side that he says resemble gods making love to women and babies being born. </p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>The myriad of sea grottoes are popular spots among couples looking for privacy. </p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>Among them is Lovers' Cave, where it is said that if a man and a woman enter the cave as two people, they will inevitably succumb to lust and come out as three, with a baby just conceived.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>"It's a mystery, there's something in that cave that drives hormones wild and blinds people with desire," says Terrano.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>To enhance the experience and further boost libido, Terrano often dives from his boat to fetch raw sea urchins -- a major aphrodisiac treat -- to serve pronto to his clients on a slice of grilled bruschetta bread.</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component"><p>As if they'd need it. </p></p></div>

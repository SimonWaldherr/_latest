  Trump news live: Latest Covid updates as president calls Fauci ‘disaster’ and CNN ‘dumb b*****ds’ 
description: > 
  US president Donald Trump in Arizona on MondayDonald Trump has renewed his attack on Dr Anthony Fauci in his latest interview with Fox News, also blustering about his re-election hopes and the popularity of his rallies, smearing Joe Biden and warning that Thursday’s presidential debate on NBC will go against him because he’s facing “a stacked deck” and a biased moderator.The president was labelled “reckless and negligent” by Biden’s campaign on Monday after he raged against the country’s top infectious diseases expert in Arizona, the president calling Dr Fauci “a disaster” while declaring that the country is “pandemic-d out” and attacking the “dumb bastards” of CNN for their extensive coronavirus coverage.Trump kept up his angry form at twin rallies in Prescott and Tucson, claiming baselessly that 500,000 Americans would have died if he had listened to his respected director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (rather than 220,000 and counting) and even warning his MAGA crowd that a Biden administration “would listen to Fauci”, apparently a negative.

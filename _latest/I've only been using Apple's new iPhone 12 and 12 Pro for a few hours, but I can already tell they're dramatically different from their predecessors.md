<p>Apple's new iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are launching this Friday, bringing changes like 5G support, a refreshed design, improved cameras, and a new bigger screen size for the Pro model.</p><p>Apple pointed to 5G as being the biggest change coming to its new crop of iPhones during its launch event on October 13. Just before unveiling the new phones, Apple CEO Tim Cook called 5G "the most exciting step yet" for the iPhone in terms of leaps forward in cellular network technology.</p><p>Whether 5G will make a big difference in the way you use your phone each day <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-release-5g-not-reason-to-upgrade-2020-10">is still up for debate.</a>That's because next-generation 5G networks still aren't nearly as common and widespread as 4G LTE. And the type of 5G that is widely available is typically only moderately faster than 4G LTE.</p><p>But 5G aside, even after using Apple's new iPhones just for a few minutes, I can tell it feels like a much more substantial upgrade than we've seen in the past two years of iPhone releases. The updated design and refreshed screen sizes make Apple's iPhone lineup feel newer than it has in years.</p>

Instant Pot's multicookers have a fervent following; for the uninitiated, Amazon Prime Day 2020 might be a good time to hop on the bandwagon, with deals of more than 50% off popular Instant Pot models across multiple retailers.

First up are Amazon's offerings, with 58% off the Instant Pot Ultra Mini 3 Quart multicooker and 53% off the Instant Pot Aura 8 Quart slow cooker. The Ultra Mini, normally priced $119.95, is the smaller version of our favorite smart multicooker and on sale for $49.99, a savings of almost $70. The 3-Quart Mini has the same digital controls and custom temperature and altitude settings we love in the larger version we reviewed as part of our guide to the best electric pressure cookers. The small size is best suited to those cooking for one or two people.

The Aura 8 Quart, which is usually priced $145.95, is on sale for $69.99, a savings of about $75. Unlike other Instant Pot models, the isn't so "instant" — it doesn't pressure cook. Instead it functions like a traditional slow cooker, with added settings for roasting, fermenting yogurt, making rice, and even baking. If you're not into pressure cooking, the Aura offers an updated take on a classic slow cooker design. The 8-Quart model is great for large families, or for making big batches of soup, stew, and more.

Amazon isn't the only retailer with savings on Instant Pot models this Prime Day — Walmart is also offering 29% off on Pioneer Woman Instant Pot Lux 6-Quart models. Both the "breezy blossoms" and "vintage floral" patterns are on sale for $49.00, down from $69.00 (a savings of $20). Aside from the more colorful exterior, this model offers an easy to use button interface and has 12 different programs, though you'll probably find the pressure and slow cook modes most useful. Six quarts is also the perfect size for most recipes.

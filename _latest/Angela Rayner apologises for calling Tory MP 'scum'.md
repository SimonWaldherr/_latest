<div><p>Labour&#8217;s deputy leader <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/01/26/angela-rayner-says-labour-leader-should-not-have-power-appoint/">Angela Rayner</a> was Wednesday&#160;forced to apologise after she called a Conservative MP "scum" during a debate on financial support for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/21/lockdown-wales-manchester-york-ireland-liverpool-lancashire-local-rules-covid/">local lockdowns</a> in several regions.</p>
<p>She made the insult after Chris Clarkson, the MP for Heywood and Middleton in Rochdale, accused Labour politicians of taking an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/enraged-andy-burnham-rueful-boris-johnson-day-total-covid-chaos/">opportunistic approach</a> to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Sources close to Ms Rayner claimed she was shocked by the accusation after she opened the debate by talking about her aunt who died from coronavirus last week.</p>
<p>Mr Clarkson was subjected to the heckle after he suggested that members of the shadow front bench believed the pandemic was a "good crisis" to exploit.</p>
<p>He was forced to interrupt his speech to ask: &#8220;Excuse me, did the honourable lady just call me &#8216;scum&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>While Ms Rayner was not asked to withdraw her comment in the chamber, deputy speaker Dame Eleanor Laing intervened to scold her.</p>
<p>She said: "From the front bench we do not have remarks like that. Not under any circumstances, no matter how heartfelt it might be. Not at all."</p>
<p>Conservative MPs defeated the Labour bid to force ministers to publish a "clear and fair national criteria" for providing financial support, and after the vote Conservative Katherine Fletcher raised a point of order.</p>
<p>She accused Ms Rayner of having "shamed Manchester&#8221; with her remarks and asked: "Is it in order for a senior member of the Labour front bench opposite to repeatedly call out 'scum' when my colleague was talking and then to fail to retract it or apologise?&#8221;</p>
<p>Treasury minister Jesse Norman defended the Government's economic response and criticised the language used by Ms Rayner.&#160;</p>

Khloe Kardashian announced on Tuesday that she is now working with a collagen line.

The 39-year-old reality TV star explained to People that New Zealand-based brand Dose & Co helped her health after she welcomed her daughter True Thompson in 2018.

'After I was done breastfeeding, there was a big change in my hair and I'm assuming it's from my breastfeeding [because that] is what I was told,' said the beauty. The star then tried collagen powder.

'I think it’s so important to take care of yourself from the inside out, so I’m really excited to partner with Dose & Co. The glow is unlike anything else,' she said on the website.

Now she is hooked: 'I'm just sort of in love and healthily addicted to adding a Dose & Co into my everyday routine,' she told People.

She puts a scoop of the Dose & Co Pure Collagen Powder into her coffee.

'It's not something that's so many extra steps out of your day,' Kardashian offered. 'My go-to is in my coffee, but whatever you like, go with it and stick with that. Sometimes I will put some Dose & Co Collagen Creamer but it depends on my mood.'

Better now: 'After I was done breastfeeding, there was a big change in my hair and I'm assuming it's from my breastfeeding [because that] is what I was told,' said the beauty. The star then tried collagen powder

Good stuff: 'I think it’s so important to take care of yourself from the inside out, so I’m really excited to partner with Dose & Co. The glow is unlike anything else,' she said on the website

Now that she takes the collagen regularly, she said it has made a 'difference really quickly in my hair, skin and nails.'

She tried others but they were not as good as Dose.

'I was taking some collagen powders for a minute after I had True, but I was still a little frustrated that the ones I was taking had quite a few fillers or artificial color. I was really, really impressed by their ingredients and the price point,' the girlfriend of Tristan Thompson said.

'Most of all, the plastic-free packaging was something that really spoke to me as well,' Kardashian shared.

She sure does glow! The star added that the formula helps her complexion

Now she is hooked: 'I'm just sort of in love and healthily addicted to adding a Dose & Co into my everyday routine,' she told People

Kardashian loves the eco-conscious collagen blend brand and 'its mission to provide healthy, high-quality products at an accessible price point.' Nothing costs over $35.

Now Khloe is Dose & Co's global spokesperson to bring their lineup of collagen to the United States.

The Good American designer also said that lockdown has been a challenge for her.

'At the beginning [of quarantine] I wasn't motivated. I would say for a good two weeks, I was just kind of stagnant and at home with my daughter watching way too much news, which is just too toxic,' she stated.

'And then I was like, "You know what? I got to [clap] shake myself out of this, get up, go to the gym, keep my routine."'

The cover girl then added: 'It's the little things that make me feel so good and then make me okay to take on the bigger things.

'Whether that be just walking around the block with True for a half hour just to get some fresh air or to keep moving my body, that's what I need that make me feel good.'

This comes after there has been attention on Khloe's changing appearance.

A source told UsWeekly on Thursday that the star has not gone under the knife for plastic surgery.

Teaser: The brand teased Khloe's involvement with the brand on Instagram

'She hasn't done a major surgery, just small treatments like micro-injections, laser work and facial contouring,' the insider shared.

In 2016 Khloe represented Kybella, an FDA-approved injectable.

That same year she wrote on her website: 'Let me set the record straight, once and for all: I haven't had any fillers or done any plastic surgery. YET, LOL. But I do believe in a great laser treatment. I do lasers all of time.

'Lasers for skin unevenness, skin tightening, stretch marks, scars, acne. Nowadays, it's so easy and you don't have to go under for plastic surgeries.'

And last year she admitted to facial contouring: 'So one of my favorite things is nose contour. But this does stress me out a little bit. In person and how cameras reflect and light, everything looks different.

'So sometimes I will contour my nose and in real life I think I look so good and then in some photos I look crazy!'

The magazine's source added that her changing face also has to do with weight loss. 'Her transformation is due to hard work in the gym,' said the friend.

Khloe has read the criticism of her recent Instagram photos but brushes it off. 'She feels like the best version of herself,' said the US source.

'Khloe doesn't care about the backlash she's been getting from fans saying she doesn't look like herself in her recent photos,' a second source told Us. 'She thinks she looks great. And actually [she] does not care what people think as long as she's happy.'

The Good American designer has also spoken out about the criticism. 'I'll never understand how bored or unhappy some people can be. I am someone who would never comment something unless it's positive,' she shared last week. 'I believe in uplifting and complimenting one another. Who has the time chiiiillllldddd?! Time is precious boo. I'm spending it on happy things.'

She then noted: 'With that being said, I love you guys!! I truly wish you all things beautiful in this world because there still is so much beauty. You just have to look through the BS but it's there.'

Khloe has previously been accused of using altering apps such as FaceTune in some posts, as Khloe has been seen in similar clothes while looking completely different in scenes from KUWTK.

However, she has previously laughed off any criticism, and even joked earlier this year that she had undergone a 'face transplant' in an apparent bid to troll fans.

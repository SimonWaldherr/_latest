The estate of a recently deceased Holocaust survivor filed a lawsuit to keep her interview out of Sacha Baron Cohen’s upcoming “Borat” movie, saying she thought the film was a serious documentary.

Judith Dim Evans, who passed away this summer, was approached to talk about the Holocaust by the “Borat” creators for what she thought was a documentary, according to the lawsuit filed earlier this week in Fulton Superior Court.

She was interviewed in a Georgia synagogue on Jan. 29.

“Upon learning after giving the interview that the movie was actually a comedy intended to mock the Holocaust and Jewish culture, Ms. Evans was horrified and upset,” the lawsuit states, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

“Had Ms. Evans been informed about the true nature of the film and purpose for the interview, she would not have agreed to participate in the interview,” it continued.

Adam Hoipkemier, the attorney representing the Evans’ estate, spoke with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, saying he hasn’t seen the film but knows that Evans will be included in the final cut.

The film is officially titled “Borat Subsequent Movie Film: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,” and is set to premiere on Oct. 23 on Amazon Prime.

Evans’ daughter, Michelle Dim St. Pierre filed the lawsuit as an executor of her mother’s estate.

The suit names Amazon Prime and Oak Springs Productions as the defendants, and wants Evans’ scene to be removed from the film and is seeking damages of less than $75,000.

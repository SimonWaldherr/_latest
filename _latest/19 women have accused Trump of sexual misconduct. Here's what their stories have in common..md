<div><p class="dropcap">Today, writer E. Jean Carroll goes to court in an unique case: she accused the sitting president of defamation. But when she came forward in 2019 to say <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2019/06/25/e-jean-carroll-what-we-know-sexual-assault-claim-against-trump/1546559001/" target="_blank">Trump had raped her </a>in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s, her story started with a familiar detail.</p><p>"The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips," <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/donald-trump-assault-e-jean-carroll-other-hideous-men.html" target="_blank">she wrote</a> in June 2019.&#160;</p><p>Former model Amy Dorris, the latest to come forward just last month to allege that Trump had sexually assaulted her in 1997 at the US Open tennis tournament, said it began in a similar way.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;He just grabbed me.

</p><p>Carroll is the only one of the 19 women to accuse Trump of rape, although his first wife, Ivana Trump, accused him of marital rape in a 1990 deposition. Trump denied it and she later said she did not mean it in a criminal sense. Jill Harth, a makeup artist who, along with a male associate, had a business relationship with Trump, accused Trump of attempted rape in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/300193678/1997-Jill-Harth-Lawsuit" target="_blank">1997 lawsuit</a> which she withdrew from court, though she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview" target="_blank">said in 2016</a> she stood by her claims.</p><p>From 2005 to early 2007, there were seven incidents when women alleged Trump sexually attacked or forcibly touched them. That&#8217;s at the very start of his marriage to model Melania Trump, and it&#8217;s in the early &#8211; and peak ratings years &#8211; of Trump&#8217;s hit television show, "The Apprentice."</p><p>It&#8217;s also in the immediate wake of when the Access Hollywood tape was recorded.</p><p>Two of the allegations took place in July 2006 &#8212; the same month Trump had his affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels,&#160;who received a $130,000 payment just before the 2016 election by the president&#8217;s former lawyer and signed a nondisclosure agreement about the affair. It is&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/03/trump-investigation-goes-beyond-hush-money-manhattan-da-suggests/5573931002/" target="_blank">now part of a larger investigation into Trump's finances</a>.</p><p class="oembed-frame">
</p><p>That same weekend, Jessica Drake said, Trump kissed her without permission and offered to pay her for sex. Ninni Laaksonen, the former Miss Finland, said that he grabbed her butt that same month before an appearance on the David Letterman show.&#160;</p><p>Though our analysis focused on 19 women who alleged physical contact, more women have alleged other&#160;inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature from Trump, including a number of participants in pageants he owned like&#160;former Miss North Carolina Samantha Holvey, who said he made her feel "like a piece of meat." And former Miss Teen Vermont Mariah Billado and former Miss Arizona Tasha Dixon who both say Trump entered dressing rooms unannounced while young women were topless or naked.</p><p>Trump's own comments about "inspecting" Miss USA contestants and claims he would touch them, Tuerkheimer said, are an example of entitlement that "can lead to an inference that a person is more willing to just touch, just grab, just grope, just kiss."</p><p class="custom-chapter-marker no-image Serif" id="10-women-allege"><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">10 women allege the incidents happened in business settings</h2></p><p class="oembed-frame">

</p><p>More than half of the cases are alleged to have happened at Trump&#8217;s properties in New York and Florida, places where he had access to private spaces or more control over the environment.</p><p>Like Dorris, Karen Johnson said Trump caught her outside the restroom. However, Johnson was at a Mar-a-Lago party when Trump allegedly groped her, pulled her behind a tapestry and kissed her, she told journalists Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy in their book "<a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a29391247/donald-trump-assault-allegations-karen-johnson-all-the-presidents-women-book/" target="_blank">All the President's Women</a>."&#160;</p><p class="oembed-frame">

</p><p>Ten of the 19 women were in their twenties when they say the incidents occurred. In many cases, they were decades younger than Trump.&#160;</p><p>Dorris was 24 and Trump 51 at the time the alleged assault took place.&#160;</p><p>Kristin Anderson, an aspiring model who said Trump groped her in the early 1990s, was in her early 20s at the time; Trump would have been in his mid- to late-40s. Then-Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks denied the incident with Anderson occurred and called it a "political attack designed to tear down Mr. Trump" in 2016.</p><p class="oembed-frame">

I call the head of Exxon, I don't know, you know. I'll use a company. 'Hi, how are you doing? How's energy coming? when are you doing the exploration? Oh, you need a couple of permits, huh? Okay.' But I call the head of Exxon, I say, 'You know, I'd love you to send me $25 million dollars for the campaign.

Dominic West's wife Catherine FitzGerald is 'shocked, heartbroken and devastated' after pictures emerged of him in a passionate embrace with Lily James taken in Rome on Sunday.

The actor, 50, and the Mamma Mia! star, 31, didn't seem to mind who saw them as they cuddled up to one another and shared a ride on an electric scooter while taking in the sights, tenderly touching throughout the day.

A female friend of Catherine who came to console her at the family home near Chippenham, Wiltshire, told MailOnline on Monday that she has seen the pictures and is 'devastated' as she thought they were 'very much together' with a 'good marriage'.

They said: 'Catherine has seen the pictures and she's devastated. I came over to speak with her as soon as I knew about them.

'Catherine has been trying to speak with Dominic but he's not answering his phone. She's totally shocked because she didn't know anything was going on. They were very much together, so this is completely out of the blue.

'She thought they had a good marriage and now it's probably over. That's how she feels right now but the two of them need to speak but at the moment, she's lost for words.'

A gardener who lives on the grounds of the stunning property said: 'This is their family home and as you can see it's a wonderful place. They've got great kids and everything that you can imagine.

'Catherine was devastated when she saw those pics and they also left us feeling quite numb. It's a total shock to all of us who know them.'

Neighbours in the picturesque postcard village where Catherine lives with Dominic and their children - daughter Dora, 13, son Senan, 12, son Francis, 11, and daughter Christabel, seven, have also been rallying around her.

The actor also has another daughter Martha, 22, with former girlfriend Polly Astor.

One said: 'To say she's in shock would be an understatement. She's heartbroken and has got nothing to publicly say. She needs to be left alone and have some time to herself.'

MailOnline has contacted Dominic's representatives for comment.

Lily and married actor Dominic surprised onlookers when they were pictured passionately kissing while dining al fresco during a romantic break in Rome on Sunday.

Dominic is best known for playing Noah Solloway in Showtime drama, The Affair, which explores the emotional effects of an extramarital relationship between his character and a younger woman who catches his eye, named Alison Bailey (Ruth Wilson).

In real life, the actor has been married to Irish landscape designer and aristocrat Catherine since 2010 but he was not wearing his wedding ring while in Rome.

On Thursday, it was announced that Lily, 31, had split from The Crown star Matt Smith, 37, for good after a failed attempt to rekindle their relationship in lockdown following an on-off five year romance.

But the pair go way back and starred in Othello together at Sheffield's Crucible back in 2011. Lily played Desdemona when she was aged 22 and Dominic played Iago aged 41.

Dominic previously spoke about his marriage and wife Catherine in an interview with Vogue UK in 2015, he was discussing his role as Noah Solloway in steamy Showtime drama, The Affair.

He said: 'I think, really, what marriage is is two people helping each other to live the best lives they can. And that's what happened with me and my missus. That's why it works. She doesn't get jealous, either. If she were doing the scenes I'm doing in The Affair, I would hate it.'

Praising his wife at the time, he added: 'Does she watch? She saw it a bit, and I said, ''What d'ya think?'' And she said, ''Yeah, it's all right!'' She's incredibly undemanding in that way and it gives me a freedom I never want to give up, and I hope I do that for her, too.'

In May, Matt and Lily sparked rumours they'd reconciled after spending lockdown together at their joint home, having split last December after five years as a couple.

Lily and Matt first met while filming Pride and Prejudice and Zombies in 2014, but didn't confirm their romance until February the following year.

The couple parted ways in December 2019 after five years together, with reports claiming their romance had hit the buffers over Matt's closeness to his The Crown co-star Claire Foy, 37.

In July, Lily was pictured enjoying a night out in London with Captain America star Chris Evans.

Dominic recently hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons when he said he 'jumped for joy' after learning about President Trump's coronavirus diagnosis.

GMB host Kate Garraway, 53, later revealed that Dominic 'personally apologised' to her, she claimed that he 'wasn't aware' her husband Derek Draper, also 53, was 'still sick' with Covid-19 .

The Wire actor didn't hold back when asked for his views on Trump's positive result after the President, 74, had minimised the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic for months.

Appearing on video link from his Wiltshire home, Dominic was branded 'evil' and 'disgusting' after saying: 'Well I did slightly leap in the air with joy.

'I think the phrase is ''what goes around comes around''. I just hope it doesn't interfere with him being elected out of office that's all.'

He was far from the only left-wing social media user to take delight in the President's diagnosis with many advancing theories that his illness would harm his chances in the presidential election on November 3.

Kate questioned if Dominic was suggesting he wished Trump well on a personal level, but perhaps felt this was karmic given that Trump had previously downplayed the virus.

The actor's words were somewhat tone deaf, given that Kate's husband Derek, 53, has become the longest patient battling coronavirus in hospital in the UK as he enters his seventh month in hospital.

Dominic said: 'Well there's an element of schadenfreude I suppose.

'I'm not a fan of his, as you can probably tell, and I just hope Biden stays healthy and gets the presidency as quickly as possible. I think Trump is a catastrophe for America and the world.'

Move up a bit: The pair did well to both fit on the scooter as they traversed across the cobbled streets

Taking it easy: They carefully looked left and right before heading out into the main road

Gasping: At one point, Dominic removed his mask for a second as he got some air

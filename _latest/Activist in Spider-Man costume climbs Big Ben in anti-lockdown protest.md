  Activist in Spider-Man costume climbs Big Ben in anti-lockdown protest 
description: > 
  An activist dressed as Spider-Man scaled scaffolding outside London’s Big Ben on the edge of Parliament early Thursday — unfurling two huge banners, one blasting the country’s coronavirus lockdown and the other insisting “all lives matter.”The unidentified wallcrawler managed to climb up scaffolding at the UK landmark just before 8 a.m. and shouted at cheering crowds for around two hours before he climbed down and was arrested, police said.It has also seen other similar protests since then — including an activist dressed as Prime Minister Boris Johnson who scaled Big Ben a year ago.“Parliament takes security extremely seriously.A review is underway, the outcomes of which will not be disclosed for security reasons,” a spokesperson told London’s Evening Standard.The scaffolding has been there since 2017 as part of a $100 million restoration of the landmark that is expected to finish next year.

<div><p>An activist dressed as Spider-Man scaled scaffolding outside London&#8217;s Big Ben on the edge of Parliament early Thursday &#8212; unfurling two huge banners, one blasting the country&#8217;s coronavirus lockdown and the other insisting &#8220;all lives matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unidentified wallcrawler managed to climb up scaffolding at the UK landmark just before 8 a.m. and shouted at cheering crowds for around two hours before he climbed down and was arrested, <a href="https://twitter.com/MPSWestminster/status/1319175937817219072" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">police said.</a></p>
<p>The protester unfurled two banners &#8212; one attacking the UK government&#8217;s ongoing lockdowns, and the other saying, &#8220;Black and all lives matter so unify peoples of the world, unite and put things right.&#8221;</p>
<p>London&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/MPSWestminster/status/1319214145821081600" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Met Police said</a> the protester &#8212; who is in his 60s &#8212; was evaluated by the London Ambulance Service when he eventually came down at around 9.45 a.m.</p>
<p>He was arrested on suspicion of criminal trespass under a section of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/4/made#:~:text=Under%20section%20128%20of%20the,Northern%20Ireland%20as%20a%20trespasser.&amp;amp;text=This%20Order%20amends%20the%202007,National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales%20site." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serious Organised Crime and Police Act</a> because the building is a &#8220;protected site.&#8221;</p>
<p>The breach left Parliament reviewing security at the site, which is not only the house of power in the UK, but it is where a <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/03/23/the-moment-london-parliament-terrorist-attacked-pedestrians/">terrorist stabbed an unarmed policeman</a> to death in 2017.</p>
 
<p>It has also seen other similar protests since then &#8212; including an <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/18/daredevil-dressed-as-boris-johnson-climbs-big-ben-to-fight-climate-change/">activist dressed as Prime Minister Boris Johnson</a> who scaled Big Ben a year ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parliament takes security extremely seriously. A review is underway, the outcomes of which will not be disclosed for security reasons,&#8221; a spokesperson <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/spiderman-protester-scales-big-ben-scaffolding-london-lockdown-a4572544.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told London&#8217;s Evening Standard</a>.</p>
<p>The scaffolding has been there since 2017 as part of a $100 million <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/big-ben/elizabeth-tower-and-big-ben-conservation-works-2017-/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restoration of the landmark</a> that is expected to finish next year.</p>

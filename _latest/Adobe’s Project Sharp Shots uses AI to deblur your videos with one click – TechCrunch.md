  Adobe’s Project Sharp Shots uses AI to deblur your videos with one click – TechCrunch

<div><p id="speakable-summary">Every year at its <a href="https://www.adobe.com/max.html">MAX user conference</a>, Adobe shows off a number of research projects that may or may not end up in its Creative Cloud apps over time. One new project that I hope we&#8217;ll soon see in its video apps is Project Sharp Shots, which will make its debut later today during the MAX Sneaks event. Powered by Adobe&#8217;s Sensei AI platform, Sharp Shots is a research project that uses AI to deblur videos.</p>
<p>Shubhi Gupta, the Adobe engineer behind the project, told me the idea here is to deblur a video &#8212; no matter whether it was blurred because of a shaky camera or fast movement &#8212; with a single click. In the demos she showed me, the effect was sometimes relatively subtle, as in a video of her playing ukulele, or quite dramatic, as in the example of a fast-moving motorcycle below.</p>
<p>With Project Sharp Shots, there&#8217;s no parameter tuning and adjustment like we used to do in our traditional methods,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;This one is just a one-click thing. It&#8217;s not magic. This is simple deep learning and AI working in the background, extracting each frame, deblurring it and producing high-quality deblurred photos and videos.&#8221;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fast_moving_Car.png"><img class="wp-image-2063691 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fast_moving_Car.png" alt="" width="3340" height="1710"></a></p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AdobeGupta tells me the team looked at existing research on deblurring images and then optimized that process for moving images &#8212; and then optimized that for lower-memory usage and speed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that After Effects already offers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlcLa5JeTrE">some of these capabilities</a> for deblurring and removing camera shake, but that&#8217;s a very different algorithm with its own set of limitations.</p>
<p>This new system works best when the algorithm has access to multiple related frames before and after, but it can do its job with just a handful of frames in a video.</p>

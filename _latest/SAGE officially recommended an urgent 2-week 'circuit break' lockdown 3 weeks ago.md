The government's scientific advisors officially recommended an urgent two-week 'circuit break' lockdown three weeks ago, it emerged tonight.

Boris Johnson has been asked to explain why he is seemingly ignoring scientific advice, with Labour branding it "alarming".

Documents slipped out by the government show scientists were urging Boris Johnson to go further than the three-tier local lockdown system he announced today.

The Prime Minister today announced restrictions on household contact and travel and shut pubs that don't serve food in the worst 'Tier 3' area.

Yet at a No10 press conference tonight, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty admitted the standard Tier 3 measures in England do not go far enough on their own.

Now bombshell papers - quietly published on the government's website moments after the press conference - show how much further SAGE asked the PM to go.

In a meeting on September 21, the group said a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown across the whole of England was one of a shortlist of five measures that "should be considered for immediate introduction".

SAGE said a circuit-breaker of perhaps two to three weeks was "likely to have similar levels of effectiveness as national lockdown in Spring" and bring the R below 1, albeit only temporarily.

"Modelling suggests that 14 days of significant reduction in transmission in October could put the epidemic back 28 days and could significantly reduce the prevalence of infection in December," SAGE added.

“The amount of ‘time gained’ is highly dependent on how quickly the epidemic is growing – the faster the growth or stricter the measures introduced, the more time gained.”

SAGE did not call for all five changes to be taken at once but warned: "A package of interventions will need to be adopted to prevent this exponential rise in cases. Single interventions are unlikely to be able to reduce incidence. If schools are to remain open, then a wide range of other measures will be required."

SAGE admitted the measures would inflict a hit to the economy but called for government support to help.

The experts agreed: "All these interventions listed above have associated costs in terms of health and wellbeing and many interventions will affect the poorest members of society to a greater extent. Measures will be needed urgently to mitigate these effects and to achieve equity and social justice."

Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: "This is deeply alarming. Why were these documents published an hour AFTER the press conference?

"Why is the government ignoring its own scientists? Why is the PM taking steps that scientists say will not be sufficient? What is the PM going to do to get control of the virus?"

In its shortlist of five options, SAGE asked the government to "consider for immediate introduction":

A circuit-breaker (short period of lockdown) to return incidence to low levels

Advice to work from home for all those who can;

Banning all contact within the home with members of other households (except members of a support bubble)

Closure of all bars, restaurants, cafes, indoor gyms, and personal services (e.g. hairdressers)

All university and college teaching to be online unless absolutely essential.

The day after the SAGE meeting, Boris Johnson told staff to work from home if they could in a major U-turn - but did not announce any of the other measures at that time.

Three weeks on, he has not closed any restaurants, cafes, gyms or hairdressers even in the worst-hit 'Tier 3' areas, apart from some bespoke closures in Liverpool City Region.

And indoor contact is banned between members of different households in Tier 2 and 3, but not Tier 1.

Universities are being advised they could move teaching online but there is no compulsion on them to do so.

The PM refused SAGE's plea for a circuit-breaker lockdown despite SAGE's modelling suggesting it would have a major impact on the virus.

SAGE added: "The more rapidly these interventions are put in place the greater the reduction in COVID-related deaths and the quicker they can be eased."

But the PM became locked in talks with northern leaders and only introduced the three-tier lockdown system today after a row over whether support for workers was enough.

SAGE did also say a circuit-breaker "could be timed around planned school holidays to help mitigate the impact, but not necessarily."

Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said: "Only one of the measures suggested was introduced and some that weren’t on there were instead. Must be part of the reason we are in this mess today."

Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: “The revelations in this paper are alarming.

“The fact that the Prime Minister chose to publish it an hour after his press conference is yet more evidence that he is treating the British people with contempt.

“The Government now needs to urgently explain why it ignored its own scientists and what it will be doing to get control of the virus.”

At tonight's press conference, England's top medic signalled he believed the new Covid Local Alert Level system was not enoguh.

Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty, who was at the meeting on September 21, warned that even the strictest new lockdown measures would not "be enough to get on top of it" in the worst-hit areas.

His warning came only hours after Mr Johnson announced a three-tier lockdown system, where areas in England would be rates as 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' risk.

Standing beside the Prime Minister at a Downing Street press conference, Prof Whitty said: "I am very confident that the measures that are currently in place are helping to slow the virus.

"These measures will help to slow it further.

"I am not confident - nor is anybody confident - that the Tier 3 proposals for the highest rate, if you did the absolute base case and nothing more would be enough to get on top of it."

Prof Whitty suggested tougher measures would be necessary, saying there was lots of "flexibility" for leaders in the worst-affected regions to bring in extra curbs.

"They can do significantly more than the absolute base, because the base will not be sufficient," he said.

"I think that's very clearly the professional view."

Liverpool City Region has already put in place measures that go further than the Tier 3 baseline - including shutting leisure centres, gyms, betting shops and casinos.

President Emmanuel Macron is due to address the nation on Wednesday evening about the current situation. The number of new infections has been rising and hit a peak last Saturday at more than 27,000 in a day.

On Monday, 96 deaths were reported, bringing the total since the virus first hit the country to 32,825. The situation is particularly worrying in Paris, where the head of the regional health body, Aurélien Rousseau, said that the positivity rate in tests was now 17 per cent - the highest figure ever seen.

The infection rate in the capital now stands at 413 per 100,000 inhabitants, well above the maximum alert level of 250.

The occupancy rate of Covid patients in intensive care has hit 42 per cent. Martin Hirsch, head of Paris hospital group AP-HP, said that within ten days, that figure would reach 70 to 90 per cent. "It's inevitable. The situation is grave," he told Le Parisien.

Spain

As the Covid second wave has kicked in, Spain has become a patchwork of different types of lockdown, involving varying restrictions applied under different epidemiological parameters.

Although the country was under one of the strictest lockdown regimes in Europe due to a national state of emergency that lasted for three months, since June 21 healthcare management has reverted to Spain’s 17 regions.

They are showing vastly different results in terms of containing infections and in how to clamp down on a rising caseload.

Last week Spain’s national government re-introduced a state of emergency to cover the region of Madrid, where the local authority disagreed with the need to ban non-essential traffic in and out of the capital.

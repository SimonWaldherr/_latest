title: > 
  D-day for a stimulus deal as Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin to hold final talks on $2 trillion package 
description: > 
  Nancy Pelosi's 48-hour deadline to reach a deal with Republicans on the latest coronavirus stimulus package expires Tuesday as she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin scramble to wrap up negotiations.Those involved in talks claim Mnuchin has already agreed to more than $1.9 trillion in spending for the package, including a major $60 billion rental assistance program.The two sides, however, walked away Monday with different ideas of where they are on reaching a deal, despite narrowing their differences.While President Donald Trump says he agrees with going big on the latest stimulus package, he opposes measures Pelosi has included in her $2.2 trillion CAREs Act â€“ calling the measures 'goodies' for Democrats.Republicans lament that Democrats will only settle for the $143 billion and will not meet anywhere in the middle.

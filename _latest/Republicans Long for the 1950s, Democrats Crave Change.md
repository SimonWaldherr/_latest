<div><p>Republicans don't like change. They might get it next month, anyway.</p><p>Fewer than half of Republicans &#8211; 46% &#8211; think American culture and the nation's way of life have changed for the better since the 1950s, compared to 62% of Democrats who feel that way, according to a sweeping <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/amid-multiple-crises-trump-and-biden-supporters-see-different-realities-and-futures-for-the-nation/">report </a>about American values and opinion by the nonpartisan group PRRI.</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>A deeper dive into views toward changes in American demographics shows why: 13% of Republicans, for example, say they prefer that America be made up of people from a wide variety of religions (53% of Democrats feel that way). One in four Republicans "mostly agree" with the statement that America should be made up of people from all over the world (63% of Democrats think so). Six out of ten Republicans believe that men are punished just for being men, compared to a fourth of Democrats who believe that.</p><p>Republicans also show less support for the Black Lives Matter movement, with 79% saying police killings of Blacks that have caused widespread civil unrest are isolated incidents (17% of Democrats think so). Republicans are also less likely than Democrats to believe there is "a lot of" discrimination against Blacks, Asian Americans or Hispanics. In fact, Republicans are more likely to believe white people suffer discrimination, with 57% of GOPers feeling that way, according to PRRI, which studies the intersection of culture, politics and religion.</p><p>The picture adds up to dramatically different visions of America held by Democrats and Republicans, with the latter group harkening for a time when the county was home to smaller percentages of racial and ethnic minorities, and when women had less political and social power.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"Perhaps the most powerful word Trump has ever uttered is the word, 'Again,' " says Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO of PRRI. "His call to 'Make American Great Again' &#8211; which in Trump's hands has largely meant a white grievance agenda fueled by xenophobic and racial fears &#8211; has transformed political conservatism from a principled philosophy to a rear-guard exercise in nostalgia, an effort to prop up the power of a declining white Christian base amid the changing demographics of the country."</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on the 2020 Election</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/0da1cfe/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Ff6%2F62%2F3fdef3c04aef926a45c2d8ba93d4%2F20201015edhan-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>But while Republicans might harken back to an earlier time, the report also found that big change may be coming anyway: Democratic nominee <a href="https://www.usnews.com/elections/joe-biden">Joe Biden </a>leads President <a href="https://www.usnews.com/elections/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> by 14 percentage points, with Biden capturing 56% support and the incumbent, 42% support.</p><p>Trump's 2016 campaign appealed strongly to the sort of GOP voter nostalgic for what they perceived as a simpler or more pleasant time; his "Make America Great Again" slogan hit home with voters &#8211; especially white men &#8211; who were uneasy with the direction of the nation.</p><p>But PRRI's report found that it is Trump's performance in office that is hindering him now.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>The president's approval rating among all voters remains at a dismal 40% (with 59% disapproving), and there doesn't appear to be much room for improvement, the group found. Among those who disapprove of his job performance, just 21% say there is something he could do to win them over. But among those who approve of him now, 63% say there is something Trump could do to lose their approval.</p><p>Mirroring other polls, the PRRI survey found that Trump's relatively strong numbers on the economy (half approve, half disapprove) are overwhelmed by poor marks on other pressing issues. Just a little more than a third &#8211; 35% &#8211; of Americans approve of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, compared to 65% who disapprove.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Similarly, 35% approve of the president's handling of summer protests after the deaths of Black men in police custody, with 54% disapproving. More than 6 in 10 Americans &#8211; 63% &#8211; say Trump has damaged the dignity of the presidency. A majority, 57%, say Trump's rhetoric and behavior have encouraged white supremacists.</p><p>The survey also found tremendous voter enthusiasm, in line with predictions that this election season might produce record turnout. The vast majority, 86%, said they were registered to vote, and another 6% said they planned to register.</p><p>And 76% say they are absolutely certain they will vote this election season, a stunning number, given the limitations of the pandemic. Early voting is already breaking records nationally and in individual states, according to ongoing tallies by the <a href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html">U.S. Elections Project</a>. By Sunday, nearly 29 million people had voted early, according to the U.S. Elections Project. That&#8217;s more than a fifth of the entire 2016 turnout.</p><p>A majority &#8211; 55% &#8211; say they are not confident that Trump will concede to Biden if the former vice president wins the election. But lower-ranking Republicans may come to the rescue, Americans believe. The PPRI survey found that a combined 62% of Americans are very or somewhat confident GOP leaders would convince Trump it's his time to go, if need be.<br></p></div>

Sales of new cars are dwindling, but experts say that those who want to upgrade their vehicle now can get a bargain.

In September, sales of new cars declined 4pc on the previous year, marking the lowest number of cars sold in the month since records began in 1999, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

September and March have been key months for car sales data since Britain moved to the “two-plate system”, where licence plates are changed every six months. People often wait to buy cars until the new plate is due, making these months the biggest for sales in dealerships.

But the number sold last month is almost 16pc less than the average number of September sales over the past decade.

Overall, there have been 615,000 fewer registrations so far in 2020 and the SMMT said it expected the market to fall by 30pc by the end of the year, equivalent to £21.2bn of sales lost. The three most-bought cars this year were the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen Golf.

Sepi Arani of Carwow, a comparison site, said: "With the vast majority of brands looking to recover lost sales during lockdown, now more than ever we see increasingly strong offers in the market, making the remainder of 2020 a great time to snap up a great deal on a new car."

It was the fly that launched 1,000 tweets. Well, probably lots more.

"Saturday Night Live" predictably spoofed this week's Vice Presidential debate, after mocking the first debate in the episode's season premiere.

Maya Rudolph reprised her role as Kamala Harris and entered the debate stage spraying Lysol. Beck Bennett played Vice President Mike Pence – who had not one, but two flies on his head during the sketch, an homage to the fly on his head that stole everyone's attention on Wednesday.

Kate McKinnon played USA TODAY's own Susan Page, the moderator of Wednesday's debate. "I'm Susan Page and I missed book club for this," McKinnon quipped.

"The topic is coronavirus," McKinnon, as Page, began the debate questioning. "Dammit," Bennett, as Pence, said in return.

Rudolph predictably delivered Harris's viral "I'm speaking" line several times, and riffed on other moments as well: "How calm were you when you didn't know where you were going to get your next roll of toilet paper? Hmm? How calm were you when you were staring at that cardboard tube when you finished the roll and thought 'Well it's technically paper?'"

She went on to announce what types of facial expressions she was making in response to Pence's statements during the debate, basically saying what Twitter was thinking during the debate on Wednesday.

But the real star of the sketch came later: Jim Carrey reprised his role as Joe Biden and – as an apparent nod to the movie "The Fly" starring Jeff Goldblum – arrived on the debate stage via a teleportation device as, indeed, a fly. He sat on top of Pence's head, and which Page calls out in the sketch. Neither Harris no Page mentioned the fly during Wednesday's debate, and Pence appeared unaware of its presence.

A second fly appeared, too: Herman Cain, played by Kenan Thompson. Cain died earlier this year after attending President Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cain did not wear a mask.

The fly had already inspired the launch of Biden/Harris swatters earlier this week, a number of new Twitter accounts and endless jokes — and also a campaign to get Goldblum on "Saturday Night Live." In fact, the actor's name was trending on Twitter, along with the term "The Fly," right after the debate ended on Wednesday.

Goldblum is the star of David Cronenberg's 1986 sci-fi/horror remake "The Fly," in which he plays a fit, eccentric scientist who starts turning into, you guessed it, a fly, with the help of some creepy special effects.

USA TODAY had reached out to Goldblum's representatives for comment earlier this week.

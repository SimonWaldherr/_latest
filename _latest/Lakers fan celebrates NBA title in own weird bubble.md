Some Lakers fans caused chaos in Los Angeles after their team won the 2020 NBA title. Others just wanted to celebrate peacefully — and not risk getting COVID-19.

One Lakers fan was spotted on the streets of Los Angeles walking around in a plastic bubble. The fan, who donned a yellow “Who’s Your Mamba?” t-shirt in honor of the late Kobe Bryant, appeared to feel safe and sound inside a personal bubble with no need to wear a mask.

The Lakers crushed the Heat in Game 6 on Sunday night to win their first NBA championship in a decade.

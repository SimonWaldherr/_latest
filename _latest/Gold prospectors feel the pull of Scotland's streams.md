It is not just the amateurs, though, who want to strike it rich on the back of Scottish gold.

With prices currently high, there is more effort being put into making new discoveries by commercial companies while deposits that were known about and were previously seen as unprofitable may become viable.

Scotland’s first commercial goldmine, at Cononish near Tyndrum, is hoping to begin production next month with companies exploring other sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Gold was not discovered at the Cononish site until the 1980s.

“Much of Scotland and Northern Ireland is quite prospective for gold, particularly in small quantities,” Dr Clive Rice, Emeritus Senior Lecturer at the School of Geosciences at the University of Aberdeen, said.

“Of course Scotland is a very small country so our slice of mountain chain is very small. That reduces the chances of finding something big but it doesn’t mean it’s impossible.

“We already have one significant gold deposit, very close to going into production. I think it’s possible that there might be other small, high grade deposits. It will take quite a lot of work to find them, but encouragement to carry out that exploration could come from the success of the Coronish deposit, or uncertainty on the world stage. When conditions are uncertain, people want to find gold.”

He said there had always been a “hardcore” of Scottish panners, with previous “gold rushes” noted in Sutherland in the late 1860s, and in Kinnesswood, in eastern Scotland, in 1852.

He said he would hesitate to use the term to describe the current situation, and that the days in which significant finds could be made regularly by amateurs are “long gone”.

“It’s quite a solitary band, not everyone wants to go panning up in the mountains every day, it’s bloody hard work,” Dr Rice said. “But now and again someone finds a significant nugget, and that encourages all the rest, but I suspect it will stay at that sort of level.”

The UK’s largest gold nugget was found as recently as 2018, by a man lying face down in a Scottish river.

The anonymous amateur found the 85.7g (3.02oz) lump of gold through an alternative to panning known as sniping, in which a snorkel is used to search the riverbed. The value was estimated at around £50,000, given its rarity.

“It is true to say that over the past few years, there have been a number of small companies carrying out exploration across Scotland and Northern Ireland, so I’m encouraged something more can be found,” Dr Rice added.

“As long as the price of gold is high, you can be pretty sure there will be people out there, looking.”

Richard Jemielita, a geological consultant from Glasgow in the mineral exploration industry, has searched for gold all over the world. He said the resource had been exploited in the UK since at least the Roman era, but that at least half a dozen companies are currently scouring Scotland for new deposits.

“Scotland is relatively well endowed with gold in a European sense, but compared with Australia, Russia, Canada, the US, it’s not on the same page at all,” he said. “The Coronish mine for example, is planning to produce about 175,000 ounces, whereas many of the mines in places like Australia, Canada, it’s multi-millions.

“So it’s a different ball game, but the mining company has suggested there could be a goldsmithing industry in which Scottish gold would sell at a premium. On the open gold market, it’s just gold, but if a Scottish jeweller marketed it properly, I think it would sell at a premium.

“I’m part of a community of exploration geologists worldwide, and a lot of us are Scottish. One grew up in Callander, two grew up in Cumbernauld. It’s always interesting to me that there are so many of us that have gone from the relative backyard of Scotland to worldwide exploration.”

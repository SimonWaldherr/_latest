<p>The election is extremely under way, with a <a href="https://targetearly.targetsmart.com/" class="u-underline">record number</a> of Americans casting their ballot via mail or in-person during early voting hours across the country.</p>



The US may face its biggest ever ballot brawl this November. Sign up to our weekly email Fight to Vote to stay informed on election integrity and voting rights.


<p>I&#8217;m personally shocked (in a mostly good way) how many people are voting early instead of waiting for election day and it seems like I&#8217;m not the only one. While it&#8217;s partly the Covid-19 pandemic driving people to be more proactive, there are also signs that the turnout signals a swell of civic engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Just look at these early voting stats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>An estimated 39.8 million people <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/1318904288173842432?s=20" class="u-underline">have voted</a> in the US as of Wednesday morning.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>20% of the votes cast are by people who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/early-voting-numbers-so-far/" class="u-underline">did not vote</a> in 2016.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Texas is leading the US in most ballots cast so far, with 4.6m votes &#8211; that&#8217;s more than half of the state&#8217;s voter turnout in 2016.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Florida also beat its early voting record, with <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/10/19/florida-shatters-opening-day-record-for-early-voting-1327488" class="u-underline">350,000 voters</a> casting their ballot on Monday, the first day of early voting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is early voting good for Democrats or Republicans?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no easy answer to that. Currently, there <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/two-weeks-till-election-day-democrats-have-big-lead-early-n1243991" class="u-underline">are more </a>registered Democrats voting early than their Republican counterparts. That includes voting by mail, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/15/mail-in-ballot-tracker-us-election-2020" class="u-underline">we&#8217;re tracking</a> in swing states here at the Guardian.</p>
<p>It could be that Republicans are opting to vote on election day because the president has tried to sow confusion and fear around mail-in voting . But will there be enough red votes to make up for the groundswell of blue early votes? We won&#8217;t know until 3 November at least.</p>
<p><strong>So the election system is functioning well?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that. While voters are turning out in droves, the election process itself is under fire. Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p> <strong>State officials</strong> such as Florida&#8217;s secretary of state <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/21/florida-voting-changes-felony-convictions-drop-boxes" class="u-underline">are still trying</a> to change rules and put burdensome restrictions in place.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mail-in votes</strong> are being rejected over small technicalities. In North Carolina, this is disproportionately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/17/black-voters-mail-in-ballots-rejected-higher-rate-north-carolina" class="u-underline">affecting</a> Black voters.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strange voter intimidation issues</strong> are cropping up across the country, like these <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-proud-boys-election-threat-rumors-20201021-b4hld4mhlvanhh4gax6ejdhvna-story.html" class="u-underline">threatening emails</a> at the University of Florida or this policeman <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/21/miami-cop-trump-mask/" class="u-underline">who showed</a> up at the polls in Miami.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Amid all this, millions of Americans have decided that their vote matters now more than ever. The first-time </strong><strong>voters we recently interviewed in Texas exemplify this attitude:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m 50 years old now. You see things in another perspective. How many times can you vote in your life? There&#8217;s not that many. There are none you can afford to lose. You always talk about &#8216;freedom&#8217; and this is that &#8211; the option to choose.&#8221; &#8211; Carmen Rocha, 50.</p>

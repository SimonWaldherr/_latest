Saturday's scheduled SEC football game between No. 9 Florida and LSU has been postponed due to COVID-19 concerns, the conference announced Wednesday.

Florida announced Tuesday it was halting team activities due to five positive tests in the past week. Quarantines for players with the virus and those quarantining for contract tracing left the Gators with concerns about the ability to field a team for the game in Gainesville.

Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin said in a news conference Wednesday that the Gators have 21 positive COVID-19 tests and they have "less than 50 scholarship players available currently" when factoring in quarantining. The 50 scholarship players available for the LSU game is three below the SEC limit.

The postponed game is tentatively rescheduled for Dec. 12, one week before the SEC championship game.

“Our priority is the health and well-being of our student-athletes and staff,” LSU athletic director Scott Woodward said in a statement. “The decision to reschedule the game comes as a result of close coordination and cooperation with the University of Florida and SEC officials, and we are in full support. It is disappointing for everyone, but prudent. We wish all those at Florida who may be impacted the very best.”

Both Florida and LSU lost games last week and were looking to rebound and stay in their respective divisions. The Gators are next scheduled play Oct. 24 at home against Missouri if health conditions allow. The Tigers have a home game against South Carolina on the same day.

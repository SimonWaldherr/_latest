To me, Playboy’s impact on the freedoms of female sexuality can’t be understated. From the early Sixties, it championed birth control, equal pay and abortion rights for women, as well as addressing civil rights, racism and gay liberation when other major publications refused to.

When you consider Playboy’s generational impact (it’s estimated a quarter of all American male college students were reading the magazine in the Seventies), Dolly Parton’s decision to return to the magazine makes more sense.

In the 42 years since her first cover, she's become a living legend. She’s had 25 songs reach number one on the Billboard country music charts (a record for a female artist), written feminist anthem-turned-international musical 9 to 5, been inducted into every musical Hall of Fame you can think of, and even built a theme-park empire.

Dolly Parton doesn't need Playboy, but the world might just need a 75-year-old Parton in Playboy.

Despite the liberties women have gained since the Seventies, society still reserves sexual pride for the young. Past a 'certain age', women are supposed to cover up the body parts straight men find appealing and try to find beauty treatments that make them look younger.

And when they do dare to show some flesh - think 48-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow posing naked last week, or Madonna going anywhere ever - we throw up our hands in horror.

But demanding women cover up is no better than demanding they undress. And with the impact of the pandemic on so many women's lives - forcing many back into the home for the first time in decades, with little choice but to take on the burden of childcare and domestic duties - shouldn't we be celebrating anything that smashes stereotypes? Anything that a woman 'can't' or 'shouldn't' do?

Roll on January 2021.

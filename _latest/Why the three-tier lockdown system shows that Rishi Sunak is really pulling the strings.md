Anyone expecting Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, to have occupied the front bench seat next to the PM need now be in no doubt as to who is actually pulling the strings behind the Government's coronavirus response.

For in watering down a more rigid "traffic light" scheme that would have seen mandatory pub and restaurant closures in the worst-affected areas, Downing Street again appears to have bowed to Treasury pressure.

Instead of the planned shutdown of all hospitality venues in the "red" tier three areas in which transmission rates are causing the biggest concern, pubs and bars will now be able to stay open if they can operate as a restaurant serving "substantial meals".

Local leaders will be able to decide whether further closures are needed to other parts of the entertainment sector and tourist attractions, rather than a blanket ban being imposed.

The move marks another victory for Mr Sunak, but it also reflects the disconnect between Downing Street and regions railing against further restrictions being arbitrarily imposed Mr Johnson as he struggles to sate Sage's appetite for a half-term circuit-breaker lockdown.

Once again caught in the lives versus livelihoods debate, compromise appears to be the only option open to the Prime Minister.

It was partially effective in helping to put off a legal challenge by a group of English pub and nightclub owners who have put the action on hold after it emerged the only pubs in Merseyside would be forced to close.

The watering down is a testament not only to Mr Sunak tightening the screw but also to the safety net provided by his announcement last week that businesses forced to close will continue to have two thirds of their workers' wages subsidised by the Government.

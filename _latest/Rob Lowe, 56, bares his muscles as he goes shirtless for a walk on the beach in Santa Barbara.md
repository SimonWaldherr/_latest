He'll soon make his directorial debut.

But Rob Lowe was intent on rest and relaxation as he combed the beach in Santa Barbara with a few friends on Sunday afternoon.

The 56-year-old actor went shirtless and showed off his muscles as he soaked up the sun on a warm fall day in Southern California.

Rob opted for a pair of classic blue swim trunks while walking along the shoreline with a few friends.

He carried a pair of dark sunglasses in his hand and sported a silver medallion necklace around his neck.

The Parks and Recreation star showed off his gym-honed figure with a golden tan completing his California-cool aesthetic.

Rob stepped behind the camera for the first time with the upcoming documentary Madness in the Hills.

The film follows Rob's journey in understanding the events surrounding the Montecito mudslides which claimed the lives of 23 people in January 2018.

Just months before, the Thomas Fire ravaged the Southern California community, leaving soil ready to be swept away by rain.

'When a disaster of this magnitude struck so close to home, killing friends and neighbors, I wanted the world to know our story. It is one of the unspeakable (and perhaps even preventable) tragedies, yet one that shows resilience and hope,' Lowe said

'When a disaster of this magnitude struck so close to home, killing friends and neighbors, I wanted the world to know our story. It is one of the unspeakable (and perhaps even preventable) tragedies, yet one that shows resilience and hope,' Lowe said. 'And just maybe, we can learn a lesson or two to prevent it from happening again.'

Ventura County Fire Department investigators later determined the fire was caused by power lines.

President Trump told a crowd of supporters he “felt like Superman” after his experimental COVID-19 treatment with the antiviral drug Regeneron during a campaign stop in Johnstown, Pa. on Tuesday night.

“The vaccines are coming soon, the therapeutics, and frankly, the cure. All I know is I took something — whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly,” the president said during his second rally since being declared coronavirus-free by his doctor.

“I don’t know what it was, antibodies, I don’t know. I took it, I said I ‘felt like Superman.’ I said, ‘Let me at ’em!'” he said to cheers from the audience.

The 74-year-old commander-in-chief went on to thank the doctors that treated him at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center after he was hospitalized at the Maryland facility for three nights.

“One great thing about being president, if you’re not feeling 100 percent, you have more doctors than you thought exist in the world. I was surrounded by like 14 of them!”

The president also boasted about his new immunity to the disease which has claimed the lives of 216,000 Americans and threatened to kiss everyone in the audience — without discriminating.

“They tell me I’m immune! I could come down and start kissing everybody, every man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I could kiss him, not with a lot of enjoyment,” he joked.

They're friends with lots in common – successful film careers, famous mothers, and thriving personal brands.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Hudson had fun reminiscing about some of their leading men – particularly, what it was like to smooch them – when Kate visited Gwyneth's Goop podcast on Tuesday.

When Paltrow, 48, asked the Bride Wars star, 41, who her 'best on-screen kisser' was, Hudson instead thought of her worst.

Past kisses: Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Hudson had fun reminiscing about some of their on-screen lip-locks on Gwyneth's Goop podcast on Tuesday; Kate seen here with Matthew McConaughey in How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days in 2003

'Honestly, I feel like I kind of haven’t had the best kissers,' Kate shared. 'I feel like I should have had better ones.'

Immediately, the Skeleton Key actress mentioned Matthew McConaughey, with whom she's starred in both Fool’s Gold in 2008, and How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days in 2003.

'Every time I kissed McConaughey, I mean, it’s like there’s just something happening and there’s like snot, or wind, Hudson remarked.

'Every time I kissed McConaughey, I mean, it’s like there’s just something happening and there’s like snot, or wind, Hudson remarked; seen here together in Fool's Gold

'Like when we were kissing, like, in the end of Fool’s Gold, we’re like in the ocean, we had the plane crash, he just had snot all over his face!'

She followed this with a mildly disgusted noise, through laughter.

Gwyneth, for her part, wondered if kissing someone she's worked with so much may have felt more like 'brother energy,' as that's how it felt for her with fellow Marvel actor Robert Downey Jr.

Gwyneth, for her part, mentioned the 'brother energy' she felt when kissing fellow Marvel actor Robert Downey Jr.; seen here in 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming

'With Robert, like, when I kissed him, I was like, "You’ve got to be kidding me, this is literally like kissing my brother."' Paltrow recalled.

Gwyneth, of course, acted with RDJ in no less than SEVEN MCU movies, including the Iron Man and Avengers trilogies.

The seventh was 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming... which the Academy Award-winning actress famously forgot all about last year while on a cooking show for Iron Man actor-director Jon Favreau.

Kate, meanwhile, did follow up with one good on-screen kisser, but she made sure to mention that the scene in which they locked lips unfortunately ended up on the cutting room floor.

'You know who was a good kisser, but you didn’t see it cuz they cut it out, was Billy', the actress said, referring to Billy Crudup in Almost Famous from 2000. 'Billy was good. That was good.'

'He looks like he would be a good kisser,' Gwyneth observed.

Kate, meanwhile, did follow up with one good on-screen kisser: Billy Crudup in 2000's Almost Famous 'was good,' she said

And before they signed off, the beautiful pair of actresses dished on one other juicy tidbit.

'Is there a famous person that you’ve had a thing with that the world doesn’t know about?' the Goop founder posed to Hudson.

And without hesitation, the Fabletics founder responded, 'Oh yeah,' before exploding into laughter.

'Whadaya mean? Doesn’t everybody?? If they said no, they’re lying,' Kate added.

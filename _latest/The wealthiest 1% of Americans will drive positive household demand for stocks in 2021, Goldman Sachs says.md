  US equity demand is set to rise in 2021, driven by a combination of foreign investors, corporations, and US households, Goldman Sachs detailed in a note on Thursday."The wealthiest 1% will drive positive household equity demand next year," Goldman said, highlighting a three-decade trend that is the polar opposite of stock-buying habits of the bottom 99% of households.Corporations will be the second largest buyer of US stocks next year, estimated to be $300 billion, the note said."We expect that a double-digit increase in gross buybacks and a normalization in share issuance will boost net corporate demand for shares in 2021," Goldman said.Wealthy households round out the estimated 2021 demand for US stocks, with $100 billion in purchases expected by the group.

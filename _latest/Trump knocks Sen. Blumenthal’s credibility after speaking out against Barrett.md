President Trump attacked the credibility of Sen. Richard Blumenthal on Monday as he gave his opening statement during the Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett — targeting the Connecticut Democrat’s false comments about serving in Vietnam.

“So Crazy to watch Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut lecture all on morals & ethics when for 25 years he said he was a Great War Hero in Vietnam, and he was never even there,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “He lied & cheated right up until the day he got caught. Thank you to those in military who turned him in!”

In his opening statement, Blumenthal told Barrett he would oppose her nomination because she will rule as justice if confirmed to strike down the Affordable Care Act.

“Your nomination is about the Republican goal of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the ObamaCare they seem to detest so much … protections for people with preexisting conditions, tax credits that will make healthcare more affordable, bans on charging women more simply because they are women,” he said.

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a legal challenge to the ACA on Nov. 10 — a week after the presidential election.

The president has gone after Blumenthal before, referring to him as the “phony Vietnam con artist.”

Trump blasted Blumenthal last month after he spoke out in opposition to the president’s nominating a replacement for the late Justice Ruth Baser Ginsburg in an election year.

“Hanoi Dick, who lied for years by saying he was a war hero in Vietnam, and was never even there (Impeach him!), should not be entitled to a vote on anything of importance!,” Trump tweeted on Sept. 27.

Blumenthal had claimed more than a decade ago that he served “in” Vietnam, but he had in reality served in the US Marine Corps Reserve during the Vietnam era and was never deployed to the country.

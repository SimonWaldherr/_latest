A glitch in a computer-controlled male “chastity cage” could cause some unlucky guys’ privates to be locked up by hackers.

The security flaw in the Qiui Cellmate Chastity Cage — which is a kind of sex toy designed to be attached to a user’s manhood — can be taken over remotely, forcing victims to cut their way out, according to a report by the BBC.

“The problem is that manufacturers of these other toys sometimes rush their products to market,” said Alex Lomas of the UK-based cybersecurity firm Pen Test Partners, which has a knack for exposing snags in sex toys and other gadgets.

“Most times the problem is a disclosure of sensitive personal data,” Lomas said. “But in this case, you can get physically locked in.”

About 40,000 of the Chinese-made devices, which sell for about $190 a pop, hit the market with the security glitch before Pen Test flagged the problem and prompted the manufacturer to come up with a safe update and a downloadable fix for older models, the network said.

The device consists of a cage that locks up over a man’s private parts and is wirelessly connected to a smartphone through a Bluetooth signal, which allows jealous or untrusting partners to “lock and clamp” from afar.

But hackers could access the code and trigger the lock on the devices, which do not have a manual override function, the BBC said.

And cutting your way out of it “poses a risk of harm,” the outlet said.

The US tech publishing company Techcrunch said there was no evidence that anyone had been harmed by the faulty gadget.

However, it noted that one reviewer who was locked in due to an unrelated bug suffered “a bad scar that took nearly a month of recovery,” BBC said.

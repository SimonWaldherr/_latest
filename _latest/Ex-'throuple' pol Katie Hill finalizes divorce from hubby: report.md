Former “throuple” pol Katie Hill and her estranged husband Kenny Heslep have finalized their divorce, according to a report on Tuesday.

The ex-California congresswoman had previously accused Heslep of abuse and blamed him for exposing the sex scandal that prompted her resignation last year.

Heslep’s attorney, Michelle Sherwood, told The Daily Mail that the divorce was settled amicably outside of court, with no allegations of abuse or violence in any court documents.

“There was no mention of domestic violence in the divorce judgment,” Sherwood told the outlet.

A rising star in the Democratic party, Hill, then-32, stepped down last October after her leaked nude photos and private text messages were published on the conservative website RedState.

The Daily Mail followed with more explicit pictures of Hill.

The openly bisexual lawmaker was accused of having an affair with her legislative director Graham Kelly and of having a three-way relationship with Heslep and her 24-year-old campaign worker Morgan Desjardins.

Hill admitted she had an “inappropriate relationship” with the campaign staffer before becoming a representative, but denied a tryst with Kelly, which would have been a possible violation of a House rule forged in response to the #MeToo movement.

In a statement at the time, she implied that Heslep was to blame for leaking her nude photos.

“The fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,” Hill had said.

When she announced her resignation, Hill blasted Heslep and “hateful political operatives” for perpetrating what she called a “smear campaign built around cyber exploitation.”

The sordid saga is set to play out on the big screen, in a film adaptation of Hill’s memoir, “She Will Rise: Becoming a Warrior in the Battle for True Equality,” starring actress Elisabeth Moss.

Shortly after news of the movie broke, Hill said her old government Twitter account was “hacked” by former staff who blasted out messages that she is “not a hero for women.”

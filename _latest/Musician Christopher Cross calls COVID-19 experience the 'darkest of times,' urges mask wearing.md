"And so, it was certainly the darkest of times for me, you know? It really was touch-and-go, and tough."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He said he believes he contracted the virus in early March while at a concert in Mexico City.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"To be frank, nobody knew about masks or anything like that... We weren't made aware that it was a problem," he said, adding he and his&#160;with his girlfriend both tested positive. "We were&#160;sick for about three weeks.&#160;The biggest thing I remember is just incredible malaise, you couldn't move your head."</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-celebrity-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In April, while feeling better and out shopping, Cross explained how&#160;his legs "gave out."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Boom, I'm paralyzed. I'm in the hospital but I&#160;can't turn over, I can barely do anything. My hands were also paralytic, which is hard because I play the guitar of course, so I wasn't sure whether I would&#160;get that back," he said.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-celebrity-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While battling his illness&#160;in&#160;intensive care for 10 days,&#160;he said he turned to God.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;There was some, you know, come-to-Jesus moments or whatever, where I was looking for any help I could get to through this, to get out of this thing," he said. "Because I wasn&#8217;t sure."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He continued, "I could tell you that I had a few conversations, you know, when I was in there &#8211; with whoever He or She is, and just saying, you know, 'If you could just get me out of here, I will be a better person.' "</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He also urged others to take the virus seriously.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I'm not a big celebrity, but it's important for people to know you can get this disease," he said. "And so, I felt it was sort of my obligation to share with people: 'Look, this is a big deal. Like, you've got to wear your mask. You've got to take care of each other. Because, you know, this could happen to you.' "</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He also said, while the paralysis he experienced was temporary, he's still suffering impacts as he recovers.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"So yeah, my walking is affected," he explained. "My speech at times can be affected. Memory is a big deal, too. Just neurologically, I'm kind of a little foggy, you know? Now I'm on medication &#8230; a nerve pain medication, which also can cause some of the fogginess. But until I can get off it at some point, I won't know how clear I would be. But most people with Guillain-Barre heal about 90% to 100% over about a year. That's what my prognosis is."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cross <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/04/03/coronavirus-singer-songwriter-christopher-cross-says-he-has-covid-19/2943984001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">revealed his diagnosis</a> in a Facebook post in April, writing, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to report that I am among the growing number of Americans who tested positive for the COVID-19 virus."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Though he did not say he was&#160;hospitalized at the time, he added, "This is possibly the worst illness I have ever had."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"For those of you who still do not believe the COVID-19 virus is real, or think it is a 'hoax' or part of some conspiracy, my advice to you is to understand right now that this is a deadly illness spreading like wildfire throughout the world," Cross, who lives in Austin, Texas, wrote.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cross is a a&#160;Grammy- and Oscar-winning artist, known for early 1980s hits "Sailing" and "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)" from the movie "Arthur."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Contributing: Peter Blackstock, Austin American-Statesman</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">More:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/life/2020/09/24/halloween-2020-how-celebrate-safely-during-covid-19-pandemic/5807530002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Tips to celebrate Halloween safely during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Halloween drive-thru:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/10/15/halloween-drive-thru-during-pandemic-make-fun-car-experience/5941906002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">In COVID times, is a spooky car experience worth the trip?</a></p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/entertainment/celebrities/2020/10/12/lady-gaga-ariana-grande-more-stars-wear-masks-amid-covid-19/5791226002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

Republicans had been eager to pivot from an ongoing pandemic to filling a Supreme Court vacancy as the GOP seeks to cling to its fragile Senate majority. But news of President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis and a string of other cases connected to the White House have deflated those efforts and returned the focus of the campaign to an issue on which the party is especially vulnerable just weeks out from the November elections.

Trump's diagnosis adds another layer of volatility not just to the presidential race but to competitive down-ballot races that will determine which party controls the upper chamber next year. Republicans, who hope to continue reshaping the federal judiciary in a second Trump term, hold a 53-47 seat majority but are mostly on defense with a Senate map that continues to widen for Democrats less than one month out from Election Day.

Democrats, eyeing control of both chambers of Congress under a President Joe Biden, need to win at least four seats to take back the Senate majority for the first time since 2014. With an expanding map, Democrats have more than half a dozen opportunities, though they still need to protect a couple of their own vulnerable seats, like in Alabama and Michigan. And one of their top targets – North Carolina – has been roiled by revelations of their nominee's extramarital relationship. The battle for the Senate remains fluid and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has put Republican chances of holding the chamber at "50-50."

Republicans, meanwhile, want to put the focus squarely on the Supreme Court confirmation of Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett before Nov. 3 and will have the chance to do so again with next week's confirmation hearings, though election observers believe the expedited process could electorally benefit not only Republicans but also mobilize Democrats worried about the conservative trajectory of the court. Still, Republicans have traditionally been able to energize voters more around the courts, particularly on issues related to guns and abortion.

But the recent spike of coronavirus cases in connection with the White House has given Democrats an opening to highlight the administration's response as well as instances of Trump and some GOP lawmakers downplaying the risks of a virus that has killed more than 212,000 people in the U.S. Trump, who tweeted Monday that Americans shouldn't fear the virus, was discharged from the hospital that night after experiencing some symptoms and two drops in oxygen. His medical team has given a rosy assessment of his health but has dodged questions that have kept the public in the dark about a full understanding of the president's condition.

"Trump wins with jobs and the economy ... And obviously he just got out of the hospital for a COVID infection, so it's hard to pivot back to those jobs."

"Now that you see this sort of rapidly spreading, it's a big problem for Senate Republicans. It's a lot of the chaos at the top of the ticket that many voters don't like," says Jessica Taylor, the Senate editor for the Cook Political Report, adding that it could further turn off suburban women and seniors – two demographics that have fled Trump in droves and threaten his reelection prospects. "These Senate Republicans are on the ballot with Trump whether they like it or not."

The pandemic has been front and center at Senate debates in the wake of Trump's diagnosis. In South Carolina, Democrat Jaime Harrison, who spoke from behind a plexiglass barrier at Saturday's debate, urged Americans to take the virus seriously, while Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham largely sought to highlight the Supreme Court. Harrison, who's been a fundraising powerhouse, has been locked in a tighter-than-expected race with Graham, who has seen the national party intervene financially on his behalf. This week, The Cook Political Report moved South Carolina closer to Democrats in the toss-up column, though the seat still remains a reach in a solidly red state.

Meanwhile, in Iowa, Democrat Theresa Greenfield pressed Sen. Joni Ernst to apologize for previously questioning whether the number of COVID-19 cases are inflated. Ernst, who's also in a tough race and a member of leadership, again apologized to essential health care workers.

Democrats are also mirroring their 2018 midterm strategy in which they spotlighted health care to help take back the House majority. They maintain that the appointment of Barrett to the Supreme Court – ensuring a 6-3 conserative majority – threatens the Affordable Care Act , which they argue is even more alarming during a pandemic. The court is hearing arguments on the landmark case one week after the November election. The lawsuit, supported by the Trump administration, believes the entire law should fall with an invalidated individual mandate.

Vulnerable Republicans have sought to neutralize some of those attacks, especially when it comes to keeping protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Last week, five senators in challenging races voted with Democrats for a bill that would prevent the Justice Department from supporting the lawsuit to dismantle the entire Affordable Care Act: Ernst, Martha McSally of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, who is facing a tougher-than-expected race in the deep-red state.

"Democrats win if it's on health care and COVID. Trump wins with jobs and the economy. Where those issues go are important. And obviously [Trump] just got out of the hospital for a COVID infection, so it's hard to pivot back to those jobs," says Mike Noble, an Arizona pollster for OH Predictive Insights. His polls have shown Biden consistently leading Trump in Arizona, as well as retired astronaut Mark Kelly ahead of McSally.

Republicans are looking to shift the attention back to filling the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat and knocking Democrats over growing calls within their party to add more justices to the bench if Barrett's confirmed.

The GOP is also working to ensure that the Senate Judiciary Committee can still proceed with its confirmation hearings next week since some members are currently recovering from bouts with the virus. Both Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina have tested positive, and a number of their colleagues who recently interacted with them are in quarantine. But as of now, they all say they'll return to work by Oct. 12, which is the start date of the confirmation hearings.

Trump has also signaled that he wants to make the Supreme Court the GOP's singular focus in the final month of the campaign, calling off stimulus negotiations Tuesday on a multitrillion-dollar deal for coronavirus relief to instead work "full time" on confirming Barrett. But since then, Trump has wavered and signaled support for both advancing stand-alone relief measures and resuming talks on a larger bill.

Beyond the coronavirus, Republicans face major challenges in polling and fundraising. Democrats are pulling in massive fundraising numbers – three Senate candidates have raised more than $20 million in the third quarter – and outside groups are spreading out their resources beyond the traditional battlegrounds. That money has forced their GOP counterparts to also spend and defend seats that still remain more favorable for Republicans but are no longer foregone conclusions, like the former GOP seat in Kansas that is now open and Graham's seat in South Carolina.

Recent public polling across battleground states also shows Trump outperforming some GOP incumbents in Senate races, a troubling sign for Republicans in North Carolina, South Carolina and Arizona that they still need to consolidate their bases. Republican lawmakers trailing Trump illustrates the skepticism that remains among some GOP voters, even as the incumbents have gone to great lengths to show their alignment with the president.

The Cook Political Report has the top-tier races most likely to flip from red to blue at Colorado, Arizona, Maine and North Carolina. Not far behind are GOP-held seats in Iowa, Montana, Georgia – for Sen. David Perdue's seat – and now South Carolina. The ones that are better odds for Republicans but still a possibility for Democrats include the Kansas race and a special election for the other Georgia seat.

Republicans also have some offensive opportunities – including Alabama's seat held by Sen. Doug Jones, the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in the state since 1992. Republicans are also feeling more bullish in Michigan, which was narrowly carried by Trump in 2016. Veteran and former House candidate John James is running against Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, and the GOP's top Senate super PAC is spending heavily there to boost James.

But one of the top races of the cycle is now on shaky ground – a seat that many see as the tipping point in the battle for the Senate.

Within a matter of hours, major news broke last week about both candidates in North Carolina: first with Tillis testing positive for the coronavirus followed by a texting scandal involving Democrat Cal Cunningham and a woman who isn't his wife. Cunningham immediately apologized for the texts and, after days of silence, briefly addressed the scandal and reiterated his apology at an awards dinner on Wednesday night. Democrats say they are standing by their nominee.

The news puts Cunningham, who has consistently led Tillis in public polling, on defense as Republicans question his character and run ads highlighting the incident. Since the initial story broke, more details have emerged about the extent of his relationship with a public relations strategist in California. The woman confirmed to The Associated Press that they had an intimate encounter in North Carolina in July. Cunningham, a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, is now under investigation by the military body.

"It takes Cunningham off message. He hadn't been out there a ton ... but now he does so at the risk of looking weak instead of looking strategically smart," says Doug Heye, a GOP strategist who previously worked for Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina.

But analysts in North Carolina questioned if the revelations would sway a sizable number of voters or how much Cunningham's transgressions would break through with an avalanche of other news, including Tillis' own coronavirus diagnosis. The GOP senator, who says he no longer has symptoms, attended the White House Supreme Court ceremony that has been characterized as a "super spreader" event. Tillis, who wore a mask outside but not for the indoor portion of the event, has said he'll "wear a mask going forward."

"The question becomes: Does it affect things in that specific race? Voters' minds are made up. That becomes part of it as well, and I think that's true everywhere," Heye adds. "In a normal world, [the Cunningham story] kills the race, and we've seen this happen before."

Plus, much of the electorate appears largely settled with only a small number of undecided voters and a sizable portion of voters already submitting absentee ballots. Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College, says that of the nearly 1.2 million requests for mail-in ballots in North Carolina, 360,000 of them have been returned as of Monday.

Even if Cunningham gets dragged down, analysts say Democrats are well-positioned enough in a host of other states to still make a play for the majority.

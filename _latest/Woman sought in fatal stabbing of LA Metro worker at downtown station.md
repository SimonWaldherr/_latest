<div><p>A woman is being sought by homicide detectives Monday for fatally stabbing a Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority worker at a busy downtown station, police said.</p>
<p>The suspect allegedly got into a &#8220;verbal dispute&#8221; with the unidentified employee late Friday on a Red Line train. The argument escalated and the woman &#8220;armed herself&#8221; before stabbing the male worker and killing him at the 7th Street/Metro Center subway station, Los Angeles police said.</p>
<p>The woman then left the Red Line train while pushing a distinctive green bicycle and should be considered armed and dangerous, according to the LAPD.</p>
<p>She is described as a white or Hispanic woman believed to be 25 to 30 years old.</p>
<p>Paramedics treated the victim &#8211; who was stabbed in the chest &#8212; on a platform before taking him to a hospital, city fire officials <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-18/la-metro-employee-fatal-stabbing-7th-street-downtown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the Los Angeles Times</a>. He was later pronounced dead and had not been identified as of Sunday because his relatives had yet to be notified, a Metro spokesman told the newspaper.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the employee was on duty when he was attacked, Metro spokesman Rick Jager said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim&#8217;s family and fellow Metro employees,&#8221; Jager said, adding that the agency was &#8220;deeply saddened&#8221; by the deadly stabbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will work closely with our law enforcement partners to identify and aggressively pursue perpetrators and bring them to justice,&#8221; agency officials <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/l-a-metro-employee-fatally-stabbed-at-rail-station-downtown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement to KTLA</a>.</p>
 
<p>The victim was a Metro employee for more than 18 years who was most recently assigned to the agency&#8217;s rail operations division, Metro&#8217;s chief executive, Phil Washington, told workers in an email Saturday, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>Anyone with information about the suspect is asked to contact LAPD at (213) 486-8700.</p>
<p>No arrests had been made as of early Monday, Los Angeles police told The Post.</p>

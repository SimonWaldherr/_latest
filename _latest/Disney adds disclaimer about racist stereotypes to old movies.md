<div><p>Disney+ will now serve it classics with an additional warning. The streaming giant has confirmed that it has added a disclaimer about racial stereotypes, stating that while the past cannot be changed, it can definitely be acknowledged and learnt from moving forward.</p>

<p>The advisory that will be added reads: "This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together."</p>

<p>This move comes to emphasise Disney&#8217;s "ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion." Instead of opting to remove these movies from their roster all together, the company hopes that allowing them to stream will "spark conversation and open dialogue on history that affects us all."</p>

<p>Some movies that will attach this disclaimer include <i>Aristocats, </i>which showcases racist caricatures of East Asian people and <i>Dumbo, </i>in which the crow characters sing in the style of racist minstrel shows. In addition, <i>Peter Pan </i>is on the list for its portrayal of Native people.</p>

<p>This statement appearing at the beginning of these films has been worded more strongly in comparison to when Disney launched Disney+ last year. The previous warning read, &#8220;This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.&#8221; Now, the 12-second disclaimer not only agrees to these wrongful depictions but also links back to the Disney&#8217;s website, &#8216;Stories Matter&#8217; where there are explanations available as to why certain characters in both movies and T.V shows are harmful or offensive.</p>

<p>One example is <i>Peter Pan. </i>The &#8216;Stories Matter&#8217; website states, "The film portrays Native people in a stereotypical manner that reflects neither the diversity of Native peoples nor their authentic cultural traditions. It shows them speaking in an unintelligible language and repeatedly refers to them as 'redskins,' an offensive term,&#8221; the site continues.</p>

<div><p>Sunday turned into a day of celebrations for Camille Kostek.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGfdVmKFvO7/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nabbing the cover</a> of the 2021 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Calendar, the 28-year-old model got to see boyfriend Rob Gronkowski score his first touchdown as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; Kostek exclaimed on her Instagram story. &#8220;Touchdown for baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gronkowski, who came out of retirement in April, caught a pass from quarterback Tom Brady for a 12-yard touchdown in Sunday&#8217;s 38-10 win over the Green Bay Packers. Following the game, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGgfqYlFvGP/">Kostek also posted a stunning photo</a> that called out Gronkowski&#8217;s play in the caption.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Me looking at Rob in the end zone,&#8221; she shared with her followers.</p>
<p>Gronkowski had not made a dominant impression with the Buccaneers at the start of the 2020 NFL season, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/22/why-rob-gronkowski-has-been-invisible-in-buccaneers-offense/">appearing all but invisible</a> on offense. On Sunday, head coach Bruce Arians noted the tight end has been playing with a bum shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;It speaks volumes for him and he&#8217;s playing with a bum shoulder so the blocking, the receiving, he&#8217;s just one of the best all-around tight ends to ever play the game. He&#8217;s in good football shape right now, we just have to continue to watch his snap count,&#8221; <a href="https://www.pewterreport.com/bucs-arians-we-set-a-new-standard-for-ourselves/">Arians said</a>.</p>

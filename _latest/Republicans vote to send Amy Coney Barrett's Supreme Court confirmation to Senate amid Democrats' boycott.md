  Republicans vote to send Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation to Senate amid Democrats' boycott 
description: > 
  Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee did not attend the meeting on Thursday, after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the hearings and confirmation a “sham process” that undermines the legitimacy of the court.In their place, Democrats on the committee placed placards of people who have benefitted from the Affordable Care Act, which the Trump administration has sought to dismantle pending a favourable Supreme Court decision.Judge Barrett’s addition to the bench will ensure a conservative majority that Democrats fear will jeopardise several critical precedents.She will be the sixth Republican-appointed justice on the nine-judge court.President Trump, eager to seat a justice ahead of the election to resolve vote-related litigation, presented his nominee a week after her death.

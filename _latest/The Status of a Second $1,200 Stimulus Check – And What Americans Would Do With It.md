Nearly half of households say they would put a potential second-round stimulus check in savings while a sizable share would use the money to pay down debt, but the odds that Americans will receive checks in the near future are uncertain at best.

White House officials and top congressional Democrats have been locked in on-again, off-again negotiations over another pandemic relief bill and remain far apart on several aspects of a potential package, including the top-line cost. And Republican lawmakers have even balked at the administration's recent proposal.

The White House has sent mixed messages of its own. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated Wednesday that a deal with lawmakers before the Nov. 3 presidential election appears unlikely, though Trump on Thursday suggested a compromise involving more money than he has proposed in the past could still be in play .

"I would go higher. Go big or go home," Trump told Fox Business.

Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have been haggling for months over a relief package. Election year politics has clearly played a part in the process. The talks appeared in jeopardy last week when Trump instructed White House officials to pull out of negotiations. But he reversed course after stocks plunged and some Republicans criticized the move.

Pelosi has questioned Trump's motives in pursuing a deal, suggesting the president just wants to take credit for the jolt a stimulus would provide to the economy and the direct payments that would be distributed to grateful Americans.

"All the president wants is his name on a check," she said last week.

For now, discussions are ongoing. The Democratic-controlled House passed a $2.2 trillion package earlier this month, a scaled-down version of a bill they approved this summer. The White House recently countered with a $1.8 trillion proposal, which was panned by both Pelosi, who said it was riddled with deficiencies, as well as Republican lawmakers, who said it's too costly.

Though both Mnuchin and Pelosi have admitted they are still at odds over several specific aspects of an aid package, both sides seem to agree that it should provide another round of stimulus checks for American households. Both the Democrats' bill and the White House proposal include provisions for a second round of stimulus checks that could end up paying out more than the first round did this spring.

Under a congressional relief bill passed in March, adults making less than $99,000 a year received checks of up to $1,200, and families received an extra $500 for each child.

The recent White House proposal includes a second round of stimulus checks of $1,200 per adult and $1,000 per child – up from the child stipend doled out this spring. The House bill also includes $1,200 stimulus checks for adults and an extra $500 for dependents of all ages.

Even if the White House comes to an agreement with Democrats on another package, it could face opposition from the Republicans in the Senate, who are wary of additional massive spending.

Trump has repeatedly said he supports another round of $1,200 checks and suggested a stand-alone bill, though the proposal went nowhere.

While the stimulus is intended to help Americans with pandemic-related expenses and inject a boost into the U.S. economy, data indicates a shift in how households would spend the extra cash if a deal is reached and checks are distributed.

In a survey conducted in June by the New York Fed, 89% of respondents reported receiving stimulus money, with a median payment of $2,400 per household.

Nearly 37% of households saved that money, while roughly some 35% paid off debt, according to an analysis of the data by economists at the New York Fed. Just 25% spent the cash, with the majority of spending on essential items.

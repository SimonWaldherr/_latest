New York Police on Sunday arrested an anti-lockdown leader in connection with the attack of a Jewish journalist at a protest in Brooklyn last Wednesday, as the city fined five synagogues $15,000 for violating COVID-19 restrictions.

Heshy Tischler filmed the moment he was taken into custody, apparently one day before he was due to turn himself in on Monday, accused of inciting a riot and unlawful imprisonment over the attack on Jewish Insider reporter Jacob Kornbluh.

Borough Park saw angry protests by Hasidic Jews this week after Governor Andrew Cuomo announced he was partially shutting down the neighborhood to stem a second wave of COVID-19.

'I called, I even spoke to the chief. They tricked me,' he is heard complaining to cops on Sunday. 'They're telling everybody that I was supposed to be arrested tomorrow.'

Heshy Tischler led away in cuffs as he arrived home from Synagogue as the holiday came to a close.



His crime?

The same crime that started Kristallnacht.

'You are moyser (snitch). Everybody scream 'Moyser!'' Tischler yelled at Kornbluh on Wednesday on Borough Park, Brooklyn

On Friday, Tischler shared a clip on Twitter explaining that Pastor Mcall & Jeffry Davis would be taking him into the 66th Precinct on Monday.

The same day NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio – who Tischler's Next News Network has referred to as Adolf De Blasio – said they were close to making an arrest. Kornbluh claimed he was labelled a 'Nazi' and 'Hitler' when he was attacked Wednesday.

It took place after Tischler was given a hero's welcome as he arrived at the protest night and spoke to the press about how Kornbluh and another Jewish journalist, Berish Getz, were liars.

'You are moyser (snitch). Everybody scream 'Moyser!'' Tischler yelled at Kornbluh.

Earlier in the day, he had taken to Twitter to hold up a picture of Kornbluch and say: 'You know where rats belong. Jacob Kornbluh is a rat.'

This was before Kornbluh was attacked but after an assault on Getz, 34, during protests the previous night.

On Tuesday, a crowd hurled bottles and rocks at Getz as he filmed video from a lamppost. He wound up needing to be carried out on a stretcher.

Lockdowns have turned political with right-wing figures stoking the demonstrations and Orthodox Jews claiming they are being targeted by the Democratic governor for their support of President Donald Trump.

However Borough Park is part of a large area of Brooklyn declared a 'red zone' by Cuomo, and backed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, after the rate of positive cases soared above the three percent threshold.

Citywide on Thursday, the rate of positive tests was 1.16 percent but in a Borough Park zip code 8.7 percent of tests came back positive, according to government statistics. In the 20 red zone neighborhoods the positivity rate was 5.7 percent and houses of worship are limited to a capacity of 25 percent. In orange zones its limited to 33 per cent and yellow zones 50 per cent.

Many of the neighborhoods recording high rates include large Orthodox Jewish communities, where residents recently celebrated the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur holidays.

Last week Tischler addressed protesters and called for flags emblazoned with 'Cuomo Hates Jews' and 'Cuomo Killed Thousands,' a reference to the approximately 33,000 people in New York state who died from Covid-19.

A New York federal judge ruled that Cuomo's partial lockdown was lawful, dismissing a claim from Orthodox Jewish organizations that it violated the free exercise of their religion.

'Covid crosses racial, religious and economic lines,' said Judge Kiyo A Matsumoto.

Cuomo's measures received backing from the liberal New York Jewish Agenda network which released a statement signed by 450 rabbis supporting the 'data-driven, geographically based approach.'

About 20 neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, Rockland County and Orange County have been slapped with intensified restrictions as the coronavirus positivity rate soars.

It means synagogues must have no more than 10 people gathered.

Congregants of the Bobov 45 say its COVID-positive rabbi held a large gathering of 300. Police were not allowed to shut down the gathering but could only issue the fine.

Schools and non-essential businesses in the area must remain closed.

Cuomo said Saturday that 826 people were hospitalized with the virus in New York, the highest number since July 15. Eight people died from COVID-19 on Friday.

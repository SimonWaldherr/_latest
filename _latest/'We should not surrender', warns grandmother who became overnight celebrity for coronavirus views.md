<div><p>The octogenarian, who served as a parish councillor for her home village of Notton for 50 years, warned that restriction would leave millions unemployed and those paying for it would be &#8220;all the young ones. Not me because I'm going to be dead&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mrs Elms, who has three grandchildren and two great grandchildren, said she had been overwhelmed by support since the interview.</p>
<p>She immediately drew comparisons with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/20/cant-believe-brenda-finds-has-gone-viral-general-election-comments/">Brenda from Bristol</a>, who summed up the feelings of many when she was told that the 2017 General Election had been called and responded: "You&#8217;re joking. Not another one."</p>
<p>An ordinary member of the public also caused some embarrassment for Gordon Brown when he was Prime Minister in 2010 and&#160;was recorded <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7645072/Gordon-Brown-calls-campaigner-bigoted-woman.html">calling Gillian Duffy a "bigot" during a walkabout in Rochdale</a>.</p>
<p>She had first-hand experience of the virus when her husband Michael, 82, developed severe coronavirus in late February, coughing up blood, and wasn&#8217;t fully recovered until May. She caught it at the end of May and developed deep chest pains but recovered after ten days.</p>
<p>The retired doctor&#8217;s housekeeper has revealed that she was against lockdown for the start and continued her routine of shopping three times a week.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;What they should have done was ensure that all the old people and the people who have health problems were protected and if they wanted anything there was someone there to take it to the house. Then they let the rest of us get on with life.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;All this money that's been spent and at the end of this year there'll be so many children, young people and old who'll be unemployed. &#8220;There's no future for the young ones where this is going.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Tory voter said that she laid the blame for the response on Matt Hancock and believes that Mr Johnson has been &#8220;shackled&#8221; by his scientific advisors. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of the young is in your hands Boris. And for God's sake, get some people around you who know what needs to be done,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would sack the lot of them, especially Matt Hancock. Get people who will tell you to open everything up and shield the vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the Health Secretary&#8217;s mistakes, Mrs Eames believes, was telling doctors to see patients on Zoom, which has made it &#8220;easier to get into jail&#8221; than a GP surgery. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It really does worry me is how many people at the outset were diagnosed with cancer and now are dying," she said. "They have no future because of this policy, they are dying."</p>
<p>Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield will move into <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/22/tier-3-lockdown-rules-high-alert-areas-restrictions/">the most stringent Tier 3 restrictions</a> at Midnight on Saturday, joining Manchester, Lancashire and Liverpool.</p>
<p>It was not just those on social media who supported her frank views as Mr Eames, a retired coal mine electrical engineer, revealed he was proud of his wife.</p>
<p>"We watched it on the telly and I said &#8216;you&#8217;ll go viral with that and she said give over. But I was right," he said. &#8220;I call her My Hyacinth, my own Mrs Bouquet.&#8221;</p>

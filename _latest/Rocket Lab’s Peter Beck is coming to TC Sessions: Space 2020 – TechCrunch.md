<div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the last few years Rocket Lab has gone from its very first orbital launch to regular commercial missions, with the goal of being the most responsive launch provider on the planet. Founder and CEO Peter Beck will join us at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=rocketlab&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">all virtual TC Sessions: Space event</a> happening on December 16 &amp; 17 in December to talk about the new launch ecosystem and building a company to compete with industry giants.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s 15th mission, &#8220;In Focus,&#8221; is scheduled to take off this very afternoon, with 10 Earth observation satellites from Canon Electronics and Planet. It has already put satellites in orbit for NASA, the NRO, and numerous private companies. The company&#8217;s launch cadence has slowly increased, though the loss of a mission in July soured its plan to go from months to weeks between launches.</p>
<p>But Beck, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/from-launch-to-launch-peter-beck-on-building-an-orbital-business-from-scratch/">who has led the company from its inception in 2006</a>, saw this as just another challenge to take head-on, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/rocket-lab-clear-to-launch-again-after-first-mission-failure-attributed-to-electrical-fault/">within the month Rocket Lab had gotten to the bottom of the issue and was clear to fly again</a>.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to own a rocket company and launch vehicles, you have to be prepared for this kind of thing,&#8221; he said at the time. And now Electron is even more reliable than it was before, he pointed out.</p>
<p>Now Rocket Lab is expanding into adjacent businesses as well with the secretive launch of its First Light satellite platform, demonstrating tech that it hoped to share with customers who don&#8217;t want to build a satellite from scratch. &#8220;It&#8217;s just really painful to go from an idea to getting something in orbit,&#8221; he said, and by making it easier to actually build a spacecraft, it both democratizes space and creates customers out of thin air.</p>

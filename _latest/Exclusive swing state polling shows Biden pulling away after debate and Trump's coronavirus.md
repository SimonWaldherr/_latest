Polling taken after the debate and the announcement of Mr Trump’s positive test in six key battleground states shows it is Mr Biden who appears to have gained votes.

In Wisconsin, Mr Biden’s lead jumped from five percentage points to 10. In Arizona, it jumped from three points to six points.

In North Carolina, Mr Biden’s lead rose from two points to five points and in Pennsylvania - a critical state given its large electoral college votes, it rose from six points to seven points.

The two remaining states did not show the Democrat increasing his lead. He stayed five points ahead in Florida and in Michigan his lead dropped from nine to eight points.

The responses will have the Biden camp cheering. Not just are they ahead but they are further ahead, in general, in the critical swing states than a fortnight ago.

If that result was replicated on election day then Mr Biden would in all likelihood become the 46th president of the United States, with Mr Trump confined to a single term in office.

That is a big if, however. As pollsters often note their surveys are a snapshot of voter thinking at a single moment in time and not a forecast of the result.

The findings chime with nationwide polls in the wake of the first debate in Cleveland, Ohio, that suggest that Mr Trump’s aggressive approach turned off more voters than it won over.

More respondents in all six states who watched the debate picked Mr Biden rather than Mr Trump when asked which candidate would most fight for their interests, suggesting a debate victory for the Democrat.

The chance of the next two debates taking place remain up in the air. Mr Trump pulled out of the second debate when organisers made it a virtual event due to coronavirus concerns, though negotiations continue.

Mr Trump’s illness thrust Covid-19 back to the top of the news agenda, both underscoring the threat the virus continues to pose in America, where there have been seven million positive tests, and throwing the president’s policies towards it into the spotlight.

This may have helped Mr Biden, who has tried to frame the election as a choice about who should steer America through the pandemic.

  Biden campaign faces backlash for TV ad depicting Michigan tech CEO as struggling bar owner 
description: > 
  The Biden team is under fire for releasing a TV campaign ad last week depicting a Michigan bar owner struggling to keep his business afloat during the pandemic.What the ad fails to mention is the man is actually a wealthy tech investor who made contributions to the former vice president’s campaign.“For 50 years, The Blind Pig has been open and crowded – but right now it’s an empty room,” he says in the one-minute ad, showing the empty venue.The Blind Pig briefly reopened in June, adhering to strict requirements such as requiring masks, enforcing social distancing, aggressive cleaning, and limited guests.The Biden campaign and Malcoun did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.

Malcoun blamed his business&#8217; economic downturn on President Trump&#8217;s COVID-19 response. </p><p>&#8220;For 50 years, The Blind Pig has been open and crowded &#8211; but right now it&#8217;s an empty room,&#8221; he says in the one-minute ad, showing the empty venue. &#8220;This is the reality of Trump&#8217;s COVID response.&#8221;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-whitmer-assassination-attempt-nbc-meet-the-press-interview" target="_blank">TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS WHITMER 'ENCOURAGING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS' AGAINST PRESIDENT WITH DISCREET TV MESSAGE</a></strong></p><p class="ad gam"></p><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/640/320/blind-pig.png?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="The Blind Pig co-owner, Joe Malcoun, seen in a recent TV ad released by Joe Biden's presidential campaign.&#160;"><p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how much longer we can survive not having any revenue.

It does not," MacFarland wrote last week in a since-deleted LinkedIn post. "To be clear, I have not endorsed President Trump, either. I'm not a political person, but this isn't about just me. I object to the use of ANY military personnel in uniform in political ads &#8211; full stop. That goes double for generals and admirals, even if we have since retired, as I have."</p><p class="ad gam"></p></div>

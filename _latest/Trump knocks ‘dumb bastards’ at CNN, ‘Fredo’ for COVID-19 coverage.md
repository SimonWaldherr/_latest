<p>Trump told a large outdoor audience in Prescott, Ariz., that he believes the cable news channel is hyping the coronavirus to depress voting.</p>
<p>&#8220;You turn on CNN, this is all they cover. COVID, COVID, pandemic, COVID, COVID, COVID, COV-ah-ah. You know why, they&#8217;re trying to talk everybody out of voting. People aren&#8217;t buying it, CNN, you dumb bastards,&#8221; the president said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You watch this guy, he&#8217;s got lousy ratings, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/12/chris-cuomo-caught-on-video-flying-into-rage-after-man-calls-him-fredo/">Fredo, you know Fredo</a>?&#8221; Trump added, referring to Cuomo, who is the brother of New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gets horrible ratings. He&#8217;s talking about the pandemic, it&#8217;s all they talk about,&#8221; Trump said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know he said he had it. I&#8217;m not sure he had it. he went to the basement, it&#8217;s the only time his ratings were up. People wanted to see what was gonna happen, probably get it again even though in theory, you&#8217;re not supposed to.&#8221;</p>

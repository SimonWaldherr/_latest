<div><p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/alex-perez">Alex Perez</a> knows the kind of fight he&#8217;s in for with <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/deiveson-figueiredo">Deiveson Figueiredo</a>, and he&#8217;s 100 percent ready.</p>
<p>After Cody Garbrandt was forced out due to a bicep injury, Perez (24-5 MMA, 6-1 UFC) got the call to challenge flyweight champion Figueiredo at UFC 255 on Nov. 21.</p>
<p>Figueiredo (19-1 MMA, 8-1 UFC) became the first man to submit Joseph Benavidez in the main event of UFC on ESPN+ 30 in July as he captured the UFC flyweight title at the second attempt after he failed to make weight for their first meeting.</p>
<p>But Perez has been on a roll himself, having won three straight, including back-to-back finishes of Jordan Espinosa and Jussier Formiga. Figueiredo may pack plenty of power, but Perez isn&#8217;t planning on backing down and says he wants to meet Figueiredo in the middle of the octagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody in the top five, top 10 can be beaten in any day, but I just feel like I bring the pressure,&#8221; Perez told MMA Junkie. &#8220;I bring the size for flyweight. I&#8217;m a big flyweight. I bring the size, I bring the pressure, I bring the wrestling and the cardio, so I feel like we match up well. It&#8217;s going to be a great fight. People are counting it out because Cody&#8217;s out, but I feel like we&#8217;re going to steal the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be &#8216;Fight of the Night.&#8217; We both like to go in there, we both come forward, we both like to throw. If people have seen my fights, I don&#8217;t take a step back (and) he doesn&#8217;t take a step back, either. So I&#8217;m expecting a five-round war. I&#8217;ve been five rounds before, so I know the cardio can hold up, and I&#8217;ve seen him go to a decision a few times, so I know his cardio can hold up. So it&#8217;s going to be a standup battle, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perez will be entering his 30th pro fight, but is projected to be a sizable underdog. It&#8217;s a position he&#8217;s accustomed to and is excited for the opportunity to shock the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would mean the world to me to prove everybody wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had people tell me time and time again that I didn&#8217;t belong here, I wasn&#8217;t good enough to ever make it to the UFC. Now look at me: I&#8217;m fighting for the title. So it&#8217;ll just be the cherry on top, winning that belt.&#8221;</p>

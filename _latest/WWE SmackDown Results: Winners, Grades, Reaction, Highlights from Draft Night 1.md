Stephanie McMahon came out onto the stage to open the show. She said she was looking forward to presiding over the draft and immediately revealed McIntyre has been drafted by Raw.

SmackDown selected Reigns, Raw kept Asuka and Rollins became the first person to officially change brands by moving to SmackDown. The final pick of the first round saw Raw keep the entire Hurt Business stable with MVP, Bobby Lashley, Shelton Benjamin and Cedric Alexander.

Big E came out for the first match of the night against Sheamus. They went right after each other and Sheamus took control with a rolling senton to score the first two-count. Big E planted him with an urinagi before spearing him off of the apron to the floor.

The Celtic Warrior tied Big E up in the ropes and teed off on him with a kendo stick. After breaking free, the powerhouse of The New Day managed to wrap Sheamus' legs in duct tape so he could get in some of his own shots with a kendo stick.

We returned from a break to see them fighting backstage. Sheamus was already showing signs of massive welts on his back as he slammed Big E onto a table. He showed disdain for his opponent but dumping flour and eggs on top of Big E's head.

Big E broke a couple of brooms over Sheamus' back before picking up a trash can and hitting him several times. They fought into a garage and Sheamus found a tire iron to use as a weapon. He picked up Big E and delivered White Noise onto the windshield but failed to get the pin.

He put Big E into a trunk and tried to slam it on his arm but the powerhouse avoided disaster. He picked up Sheamus and powerbombed him onto the hood of a car. He climbed up with him and hit the Big Ending through a table for the win.

Grade: A

Analysis

With only one person actually changing brands, the first round of the 2020 draft was a bit lackluster. Rollins is a good pick for SmackDown, though.

When it comes to the Falls Count Anywhere match, Big E and Sheamus held nothing back. Both men left this bout battered and bruised after taking each other to the limit.

This feud might have lasted longer than it needed to but this was a fantastic final chapter, especially if they end up on different brands after the draft.

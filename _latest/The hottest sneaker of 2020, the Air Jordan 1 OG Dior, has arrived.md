The biggest cop of 2020 was so haute, it came and went without ever hitting store floors.

After the Air Jordan 1 OG Dior sneakers debuted during Dior’s pre-fall 2020 show in Miami in December, sneakerheads and industry insiders alike went into a sartorial tizzy about the first-ever streetwear-meets-luxury mashup from the storied couture house and Air Jordan.

The collaboration celebrates the 35th anniversary of the release of the Air Jordan 1. The makings of that iconic pair are all there on the new one — an ’80s-inspired high-top silhouette, the Jumpman Wings logo, that signature swoosh — while the hand-painted shade of Dior gray is a nod to the French label’s signature hue (and a favorite of the founding couturier, Christian Dior).

Originally scheduled to drop in the spring, the coronavirus pandemic caused a delayed release.

On June 25, the public was able to register to shop the drop. According to a report from WWD, 5 million people signed up despite the production of only several thousand sneakers.

With a retail price tag of $2,200 (the low-top version retails for $2,000), the limited-edition high top is now reselling on sites like StockX for over $14,000.

Landing an actual pair is mission impossible, but a newly released video — which taps into Dior Creative Director Kim Jones’ deep-rooted love of the Air Jordan — offers swoon-worthy close-ups of this year’s most coveted sneaker.

  Boris's lockdown juggernaut is infuriating all sides of the Covid debate

<div><p>In fact we are liable to be even more disgruntled that the decisive change of direction away from the great lockdown sledgehammer that we thought we had secured is proving to be a mirage.</p>
<p>In the case of Greater Manchester, the Government has signally failed to demonstrate it has public consent for either the substance or the manner of the imposition of its extra restrictions. Locally elected leaders of both main parties are outraged.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s landslide majority of 80, achieved last December, should have been sufficient to propel him into the Thatcher post-1983 class of dominant premiers. Instead his trajectory currently seems much more akin to Major post-1992 &#8211; <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/01/confusion-inconsistency-world-reporting-uk-governments-response/">at the mercy of events and conveying the impression of being in office but not in power.</a></p>
<p>When he was Greater London Mayor, Johnson had the reputation of making different groups of advisers compete for his backing on particular issues before coming down on one side. This kept the underlings on their toes and also&#160;meant that everyone&#8217;s arguments were properly scrutinised before the great Johnsonian thumb was raised or lowered in favour of one school of thought or the other.</p>
<p>But at times of crisis this technique of a leader sitting grandly on a throne and listening to rival entreaties from courtiers can rapidly start to look like a leader sitting on the fence and unsure of his own mind. As one Cabinet source told me recently: &#8220;Of course one of our biggest problems is that Boris just hates making decisions, which has always been the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end the Prime Minister will either choose a bold new approach of pivoting to a strategy of shielding the vulnerable while letting working-age people back out to earn a living, or he will continue to find that his Covid policies are being written for him in advance by scientific advisers and the Leader of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Major at least had the excuse of being hamstrung by a wafer-thin majority that had disappeared altogether well before the 1997 election. Johnson increasingly appears hamstrung by himself. For many of us who were overjoyed by last year&#8217;s election result it is all shaping up to be the most terrible disappointment.</p>

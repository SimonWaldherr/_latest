<p>Micah Ulrich's <a href="https://shop.micahulrich.com/'">illustrations</a> of dancing grim reapers and mythical creatures pierced by swords might strike some as morbid, but he says his fans find them comforting and whimsical.</p><p>"A lot of people have told me they feel a warm feeling from the things I make," Ulrich told Business Insider. "That death isn't scary. It's more comforting, and it's just part of the natural cycle."</p><p>The Michigan-based artist, who describes his style as "spooky Scary Skeletons doing spooky scary stuff," once thought that he would have to become a corporate graphic designer in order to make a living from art. Ulrich told Business Insider he's now self-employed and makes his living&#160;from merchandise sales and deals with clothing lines, breweries, and bands who use his art, but declined to share exact revenue numbers.</p><p>"It is more than I'd make as a corporate designer," Ulrich said. "And it's enough to where I can have a house, I can eat, I can sleep, and I can have a hobby."</p><p>Ulrich attributes his success to his online following. The artist has more than 43,000 followers on Twitter, 226,000 followers on Facebook, and 723,000 followers on Instagram. The goal of his online strategy is to drive potential customers to his website, where they can purchase prints, apparel, playing cards sporting his designs, and other merchandise.&#160;</p><p>His popularity also helps him catch the eye of potential business partners. Catherine Hahn, stylist for superstar musician Post Malone, reached out to Ulrich over Instagram after discovering his macabre art. That led Ulrich to the surreal experience of watching from his couch as Malone performed <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8547207/post-malone-performs-circles-congratulations-at-dick-clark-new-years-rockin-ryan-seacrest-2020#:~:text=Post%20Malone%20brought%20a%20colorful,Circles%22%20and%20%22Congratulations.%22">wearing a pink suit emblazoned with Ulrich's art</a> during New Year's 2020 celebrations on ABC.</p><p>"It just doesn't feel real until it happens," Ulrich said. "And then it feels very, very, very real."</p><p>Ulrich's art is informed by a personal fascination with anatomy and a love of drawings spanning from the Renaissance to the Golden Age of Illustration. He spoke with Business Insider about how he used his dark illustrations to build a passionate online following.</p>

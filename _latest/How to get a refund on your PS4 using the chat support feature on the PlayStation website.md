You can get a refund on your PS4 for a PlayStation Store purchase through the PlayStation website's customer support chat.

You'll have the best chance of getting a refund if you request it within two weeks of your purchase, and haven't downloaded or opened it.

Once you answer a few preset questions, a live PlayStation representative will help you with your refund request.

If you've made a purchase in the PlayStation Store and have decided that you want a refund, or you've found charges on your account that you didn't make, it's possible to request a refund. Depending on the type of content you want to be refunded for, you might be able to get a refund through the PlayStation Network.

The specifics regarding your refund largely depend on the type of content you are seeking to be refunded for. Most content can be refunded if you request a refund within 14 days of purchase and have not downloaded or streamed the content in question.

If you're not sure where to start when it comes to requesting a refund, the PS4 chat support bot is here to help. Follow this guide to get started.

2. In the pop-up chat window, click on "New refund request."

3. Click "I'm ready."

9. For question six, click "Yes" if you are requesting a refund for the first time with your PlayStation Network account. If you've requested a refund before, click "No." If you're not sure, click "Unsure." If you click "Yes," answer question 6.5 by clicking on the option that most closely resembles the reason for your previous refund request.

The live agent will help you along through the rest of the refund process, including determining whether or not you qualify for a refund.

<div><p>In the very same week Boris Johnson introduced a new set of national restrictions likely to last for six months, his&#160;fianc&#233; Carrie Symonds has been spotted on the shores of glittering Lake Como with baby Wilfred and friends. She is believed to have been staying at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/italian-lakes/lake-como/hotels/grand-hotel-tremezzo/" target="_blank">Grand Hotel Tremezzo</a>, where rooms currently start from&#160;&#163;439 and climb to &#163;3,179 for a top-drawer suite.&#160;</p>
<p>Italy has been on the UK's 'green list' with air bridge status since July 4, meaning it is FCDO-approved, with no need to quarantine upon return &#8211; and of course, no curfew in place.</p>
<p>A&#160;one-hour drive north of Milan, Lake Como is the most glamorous of Italy&#8217;s lakes, hemmed in by the snow-capped Alps with picture-perfect villages dotted all around the water's edge.</p>
<p>Milanesi pop here for the day for a breath of fresh air and to soak up the fabulous vistas, while international visitors &#8211; the Clooneys, the Kennedys &#8211; have long been drawn to the grand lakefront hotels and elegant mahogany Riva boats that zip around the deep blue waters. It would appear Carrie is no different.</p>
<p>In fact, photos in the Daily Mail show her on board the Grand Hotel Tremezzo's &#163;300-an-hour launch, ready to explore the romantic region from the water.</p>

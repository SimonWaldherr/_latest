Biden’s fundraising machine gained a significant lead on Trump’s in the third quarter of 2020, as Biden brought in more than 2.6 million new campaign donors into the fold and kept up an aggressive schedule of virtual fundraising events along with Harris.

Biden entered October with a cash haul of $432 million, nearly double that of Trump’s $251.4 million — Biden’s biggest cash-on-hand lead so far in the campaign, according to figures announced by the campaigns.

The fundraising committees that raise money for both the Democratic National Committee, Biden campaign and state Democratic parties brought in a staggering $457 million from July through September, new filings show. In comparison, the committees raising money for the Republican National Committee, Trump campaign and state Republican parties drew in $355 million in the same period.

Biden’s campaign haul marks a stunning reversal of resources from just a few months ago, when he was still working to close the gap with Trump’s historically large fundraising machine. Trump has raised and spent money toward his reelection since he was elected in 2016, starting the process earlier than previous presidents.

It is not yet clear how much of the cash haul reported by each candidate is controlled directly by each campaign committee and can be spent directly on the presidential campaign, versus the money that is held by shared fundraising committees or the national party committees.

New filings show that the DNC and Biden campaign held a combined $279.2 million as of October and the RNC and Trump campaign had about $141 million together. The breakdown between the party and campaign committees will be made public next week, providing a glimpse into how much money each campaign had at its disposal as it entered the final full month of the campaign, rather than the money that the campaigns must use to contribute to the national parties’ needs.

In September, the most recent monthly data so far, the Trump campaign, along with the Republican National Committee and the two joint fundraising committees, raised $247.8 million, according to the campaign.

Meanwhile, Biden reported raising a record-breaking $383 million among his campaign committee, the Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committees.

The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump super PAC formed by former top GOP strategists, raised $39.4 million the third quarter of 2020, posting its largest fundraising quarter to date since the group launched in December 2019. The group’s fundraising has picked up steam since the spring, when its incisive ads needling Trump drew national attention. The group entered October with $13.2 million, its new filing shows.

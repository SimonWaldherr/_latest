<div><p>It may not have been the dream start to their Champions League campaign, but clean sheets are a cause for celebration at Chelsea right now and getting through an entire game without a goalkeeping nightmare can be considered a success.</p>

<p>Edouard Mendy has played two games since joining from Rennes for &#163;22 million and is yet to concede a goal, with his latest shut-out earning a group stage point against Sevilla.</p>
<p>The fact this was Chelsea&#8217;s first goalless draw since his appointment last summer will not disappoint head coach Frank Lampard, who had wanted to see better game management than he had witnessed <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/17/chelsea-vs-southampton-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">in the 3-3 Premier League draw with Southampton.</a></p>
<p>He got exactly that, as the Blues dug in and clung on when needed, enjoyed a good spell at the start of the second half, when they might have scored, and then ensured there were no heart-stopping moments at the end.</p>
<p>Mendy may not have needed to make a string of spectacular stops, but the Senegal international did the basics right and produced an assured performance that will instill some confidence into Chelsea&#8217;s back-line.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Lampard is only the second English manager to take charge of a team in the Champions League for more than one campaign, having reached last season&#8217;s last-16.</p>
<p>Bobby Robson was the other manager to lead a team in Europe&#8217;s top competition more than once and Lampard&#8217;s Chelsea side started this season&#8217;s group stages against, on paper at least, their toughest opposition.</p>
<p>As revealed by Telegraph Sport on Tuesday afternoon, Mendy returned early from a thigh injury to replace error-prone Kepa Arrizabalaga and give Lampard a big boost.</p>

Airlines or other transportation providers should, "at the earliest opportunity, disembark any person who refuses to comply."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The CDC's "strong recommendation" could be a boost to airlines, ride-hailing drivers and others that have seen resistance by some passengers to rules requiring they wear masks while traveling in close proximity to strangers to ward off the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Wide use of masks especially helps protect those at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 as well as workers who frequently come into close contact with other people," the CDC said in justifying its advice.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8211; Chris Woodyard</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a id="gpd-1603139146872"></a>States finalize their COVID-19 vaccine distribution plans</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">State public health departments say they&#8217;re ready to leap into action as soon as a COVID-19 vaccine is approved but caution so many things are still unknown that exactly what that leap looks like is hard to say right now.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For example, Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it's like planning an outdoor picnic for 1.3 million of his closest friends (the population of Maine) without knowing how much food he has, who's coming, how he's going to invite them and what they can and can't eat.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We plan for things we have knowledge around and move forward from there," he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The good news is that the earliest date a vaccine is expected to arrive is now around Thanksgiving so that gives states a little breathing room.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On Friday, state public health departments submitted vaccination distribution plans to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The plans were as detailed as they could be given the many things that are still unknown, such as&#160;when a vaccine or vaccines will become available and which groups will be first in line to get it and who comes next.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8211;&#160;Elizabeth Weise</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a id="gpd-1603139202721"></a>Wales locks down as COVID-19 cases spike</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Wales has become the second nation in the United Kingdom to lock down large swaths of its economy to combat rising coronavirus infections, even as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is resisting loud calls to do the same throughout England.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-health-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said Monday that his administration was backing a short, sharp &#8220;firebreak&#8221; to slow the spread of COVID-19.

At that point, many states had instituted&#160;coronavirus lockdowns, air traffic from&#160;Europe, the&#160;U.K. and Ireland&#160;had ceased because of&#160;travel bans and U.S. airlines were still several weeks away from&#160;requiring all passengers to wear masks.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8211;&#160;Jayme Deerwester</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Improving indoor air quality:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2020/10/18/improving-indoor-air-quality-prevent-covid-19/3566978001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Ventilation and air filtration play a key role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 indoors</a></p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-health-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a id="gpd-1603119504987"></a>New York governor says coronavirus restrictions may be relaxed soon</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Gov.

The country has required people over the age of 12 who are not exempt for medical reasons to wear masks on public transportation since July&#160;6, but the order now&#160;extends to subway platforms as well.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-health-6" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">No&#160;more than 15 people will be allowed at public gatherings and the government recommends people work from home.

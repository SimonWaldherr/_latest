<div><p>The knitwear mogul Philip Day is this weekend making frantic efforts to &#173;salvage his retail empire from a total collapse that threatens to exile him from the high street.</p>
<p>The owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group (EWM) has only days to convince administrators not to seize control, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/16/peacocks-edinburgh-woollen-mill-shut-50-stores/">with 21,000 jobs in 1,100 stores at risk</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Day, who founded the company nearly two decades ago and built it up via acquisitions of brand<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/09/24000-jobs-danger-peacocks-jaeger-owner-faces-collapse/">s including Ponden Home, Peacocks and Jaeger</a>, is working on complicated rescue proposals at his home in Switzerland.</p>
<p>However, with grim prospects for parts of the business, thousands of job losses are expected as soon as this week.</p>
<p>The self-made Cumbrian has concluded that banks will not lend to EWM in its &#173;current state. Credit insurers have withdrawn cover, meaning it is effectively unable to trade.</p>
<p>Mr Day is now due to present his rescue ideas in a last-ditch conference call tomorrow with the insolvency specialists FRP Advisory, before a court hearing on Thursday at the latest.</p>

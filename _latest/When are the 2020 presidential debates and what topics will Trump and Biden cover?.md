<div><p>President Trump and Joe Biden clashed in their first chaotic, insult-laden in-person <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/first-presidential-debate-trump-biden-wrap-up-moments/" target="_blank">debate in Cleveland</a> on September 29, in what was supposed to be the first of three debates before <a href="/race-to-2020/">Election</a> Day. But the second debate, originally scheduled for October 15 in Miami, was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/second-presidential-debate-canceled-commission/" target="_blank">cancelled by organizers</a>&#160;after Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-covid-positive-first-lady-melania-coronavirus-2020-10-02/" target="_blank">tested positive for the coronavirus</a> and refused to participate in a virtual debate.&#160;</p>

<p>Interruptions and name-calling so dominated the first debate that the commission announced the following day it would make changes to the rules before the candidates met again, but those plans were quickly derailed after Mr. Trump's&#160;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-death-toll-us-200000-covid-19/" target="_blank">COVID-19 diagnosis</a>.&#160;</p><p>Only one opportunity now remains for the two candidates to directly debate the merits of their respective visions of the next four years for the country. Both President Trump and Joe Biden have agreed to face off for the last time on Thursday, October 22.&#160;</p>

<div><p>The estate of celebrated author and Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison <a href="https://www.bhsusa.com/manhattan/downtown/66-leonard-street-10a/condo/19864666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has put her Tribeca home on the market</a> for $4.75 million, according to multiple reports this week.</p>
<p>Morrison, who died in 2019 at age 88, was best known for her novels &#8220;The Bluest Eye&#8221; and &#8220;Beloved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 10th-floor home, at 66 Leonard St., features three bedrooms and 2&#189; bathrooms.</p>
<p>The 2,319-square-foot spread is as elegant as you might imagine. One of the photos features Morrison&#8217;s white-tone library, complete with a statement ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toni had the ladder custom built, so she could reach the top of her bookshelf, and it also has shelves on it so she could rest what she was reading there and move it around,&#8221; Brown Harris Stevens broker Amanda Brainerd told Gimme Shelter.</p>

 
	<p>Brainerd is listing the home with BHS brokers Simone Mailman and Gerard Ryan.</p>
<p>She added that the ladder can be sold with the apartment &#8220;for the right price&#8221; &#8212; but the books are not part of the deal. The loft also features an open chef&#8217;s kitchen, an open living/dining room with a gas fireplace and lots of custom built-ins.</p>
<p>Morrison bought the condo for $3.8 million in 2014, <a href="https://streeteasy.com/closing/10179540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to property records</a>.&#160;Known as the Textile Building, the landmarked condo dates to 1901 and was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Janeway_Hardenbergh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Henry J. Hardenbergh</a> of the Plaza Hotel and Dakota fame.</p>
<p>Building amenities include a gym; a library/media room with a full kitchen and a wet bar; a rooftop terrace with outdoor grills, dining and lounge seating, plus a children&#8217;s play area.</p>

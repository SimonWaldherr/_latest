<div><p>Ghislaine Maxwell was grilled on her ties to former President Bill Clinton in a 2016 deposition that was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/22/ghislaine-maxwells-deposition-about-sordid-sex-life-unsealed/">unsealed Thursday morning</a>.</p>
<p>An attorney for Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre asked the former British socialite a series of questions about Clinton&#8217;s time on the multi-millionaire pedophile&#8217;s planes and if the former president ever visited his <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/31/ghislaine-maxwell-had-continuous-sex-with-young-girls-on-epstein-island/">notorious private island</a>.</p>
<p>Maxwell responded by repeatedly attacking Giuffre and blasting her as a liar.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the lies she told was that President Clinton was on the island where I was present. Absolutely 1000 percent that is a flat out total fabrication and lie,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Giuffre&#8217;s attorny, Sigrid McCawley, then pivoted to a question about Clinton flying on Epstein&#8217;s private planes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did fly on planes, Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s planes with President Clinton, is that correct?&#8221; McCawley asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have flown, yes,&#8221; Maxwell responded.</p>
<p>She added that she would not characterize Epstein and Clinton as &#8220;friends&#8221; &#8212; despite the former president having flown on his private jet.</p>
<p>In a deposition that was unsealed in July, Giuffre <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/31/jeffrey-epstein-hosted-bill-clinton-on-private-island-court-docs/">testified that Clinton</a> had visited Epstein&#8217;s private Carribbean island.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember asking Jeffrey what&#8217;s Bill Clinton doing here kind of thing, and he laughed it off and said well he owes me a favor,&#8221; Giuffre said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He never told me what favors they were. I never knew. I didn&#8217;t know if he was serious. It was just a joke,&#8221; she said.</p>

Just five days ago Boris Johnson was proclaiming that he was a "freedom lovin' Tory". This weekend, he is signing off on plans for new lockdown restrictions across the North of England.

With a stroke of a pen next week he will be shutting thousands of pubs in areas at greatest risk from coronavirus. As the Prime Minister might have quipped, it was always going to end in tiers.

Mr Johnson is assailed from all quarters this weekend about how to manage the response to this second spike in coronavirus cases.

His Cabinet ministers signed off on the plans for a three tier scheme – dubbed traffic lights without any green or amber – three weeks ago to make sense of the different local lockdown rules.

England will be divided into one of three tiers, each of which will have predetermined restrictions. The challenge for Mr Johnson will be deciding the level of restrictions in those tiers.

Tier one is likely to see people expected to follow the 'rule of six' and maintain social distancing. Tier two could ban households from mixing in homes, gardens, pubs, bars or restaurants.

It was another reminder of the strange times we find ourselves in.</p><p class="">What isn't strange is these Dodgers being in the World Series as they've played in three Fall Classics in the past four years. For the Braves, however, a drought dating back to 1995 enters another year.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Key Stats</strong></p><p class="">Mookie Betts, LAD: 2-for-4, one walk, one home run robbed</p><p class="">Cody Bellinger, LAD: 1-for-2, go-ahead homer, two walks</p><p class="">Julio Urias, LAD: Three innings, no hits, walks or runs allowed</p><p class="">Ronald Acuna Jr., ATL: 0-for-3, one walk, one run</p><p class="">Freddie Freeman, ATL: 0-for-3, one walk</p><p class="">Dansby Swanson, ATL: 1-for-3, one homer, one walk</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>The Dodgers' Stars Came Up Big When It Mattered Most</strong></p><p class="">Betts stole a run from the Braves. Bellinger put the Dodgers up a run in the seventh with the clutchest of homers. Dustin May pitched out of a jam in the first inning and escaped with only one run allowed. Urias was perfect.</p><p id="br-ad-30625479" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">What will probably be remembered from this series is the resiliency and heart the Dodgers showed in overcoming a 3-1 deficit. That spirit came alive again after they fell into a 2-0 deficit in Game 7, too. But many of their best and most important players contributed in huge ways in this game as the Dodgers' depth and star power were on full display.</p><p class="">This was a game that hinged on a few key moments.

Acuna and Ian Anderson are 22. Ozzie Albies is 23. Swanson and Max Fried are 26. Marcell Ozuna is 29. Freeman is 31 and fresh off an MVP-level season, so he isn't slowing down anytime soon. The bullpen is stacked with talent.</p><p class="">The Braves will rue blowing 2-0 and 3-1 leads in this series. They'll rue some of the questionable baserunning decisions in Game 7, and they will certainly rue the absurd catches Betts made against them.</p><p class="">But they'll be back, and they'll be a threat for a long time. It's hard to imagine we won't be seeing a reprisal of this matchup in the years to come.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>What's Next?</strong></p><p class="">The Dodgers will face the Rays in Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night at 8:09 p.m. ET.

If you want to smoke pot in Maine, you can now buy it legally.

Sales of marijuana for recreational use began Friday in the state, one of 11 that have made it legal for adults, 21 and older, to possess small amounts for non-medical purposes. Washington D.C. has also legalized the recreational use of weed.

Like in Maine, where voters gave the green light to recreational pot use in November, 2016, the time span between marijuana becoming legal and actually going on sale can be long. Legislatures often spend the interim months ironing out the details – from establishing rules for sellers, to sometimes overcoming the objections of their governors.

Here's when the recreational use of weed became legal in various jurisdictions, and when it actually became available for purchase.

Alaska - Voters okayed recreational use in 2014. Pot went on sale legally in October, 2016.

California - Voters gave the green light to a ballot initiative legalizing recreational marijuana in 2016. Legal sales of recreational weed began in December 2017.

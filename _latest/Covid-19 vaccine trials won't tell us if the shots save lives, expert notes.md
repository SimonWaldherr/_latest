  Covid-19 vaccine trials won't tell us if the shots save lives, expert notes 
description: > 
  (CNN) The most advanced trials for coronavirus vaccines cannot tell researchers if the shots will save lives, or even if they'll prevent serious disease, a drug development expert pointed out Wednesday."I think there are some pretty widely held assumptions about what we are getting out of Phase 3 studies," Doshi told CNN."None of the trials currently under way are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths.Nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus," Doshi wrote in the BMJ.The same is true of its ability to save lives or prevent transmission: the trials are not designed to find out."

If more infections are seen among people who got placebo, or dummy shots, it's an indication the vaccines prevented infection.</p><a href="/2020/10/19/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html"><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="States file their Covid-19 vaccine plans to CDC without plans to pay for them, state health officials say" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"><p class="img__preloader"></p><img alt="States file their Covid-19 vaccine plans to CDC without plans to pay for them, state health officials say" class="media__image" src="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/201019020342-coronavirus-testing-1015-large-169.jpg"></a><span class="el__storyelement__header"><a href="/2020/10/19/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html">States file their Covid-19 vaccine plans to CDC without plans to pay for them, state health officials say</a></span><p class="zn-body__paragraph">But that doesn't mean the vaccines saved people from serious disease or death, Doshi argued. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"Severe illness requiring hospital admission, which happens in only a small fraction of symptomatic Covid-19 cases, would be unlikely to occur in significant numbers in trials," he wrote.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets Thursday to discuss the ongoing coronavirus vaccine trials and what members would like the FDA to consider when reviewing any applications for either emergency use authorization for a vaccine, or full approval.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Doshi said they should consider asking the companies to reconfigure their trials to include data on preventing severe illness and death.</p><a href="/2020/10/13/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kids-bn/index.html"><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="Pfizer to start testing its Covid-19 vaccine in children as young as 12" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"><p class="img__preloader"></p><img alt="Pfizer to start testing its Covid-19 vaccine in children as young as 12" class="media__image" src="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200916220256-covid-19-vaccine-trial-astrazeneca-participant-symptoms-cohen-dnt-ebof-vpx-00023122-large-169.jpg"></a><span class="el__storyelement__header"><a href="/2020/10/13/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kids-bn/index.html">Pfizer to start testing its Covid-19 vaccine in children as young as 12</a></span><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"People expect that the most severe part of the Covid iceberg -- the ICU admissions and hospitalizations and deaths -- that's what a vaccine would put an end to," he said. </p><p></p><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-17 cn-zoneAdContainer"></ul><p class="zn-body__paragraph">But the current trials will just look for early infections.

  Trump's immigration messaging is being pushed hard in swing states. But it's not working. 
description: > 
  Immigration isn’t dominating President Donald Trump's Twitter feed these days but make no mistake: The issue is still at the heart of his re-election strategy.Despite the many distractions Trump manufactures, immigration is still very much a MAGA weapon of choice.What becomes clear is that despite the many distractions Trump manufactures, immigration is still very much a MAGA weapon of choice.More important, and unlike in 2016, his strategy is falling flat in the battleground states he needs to win.So while his anti-immigration message isn’t as brazenly front-and-center as it was in 2016, Trump’s re-election strategy is still grounded in the same cruelty that has underpinned his presidency.

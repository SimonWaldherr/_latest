<div><p>Janet Skinner, sub-postmistress, was prosecuted for false accounting in 2006. She pleaded guilty, having been advised that this would mean no&#160;custodial sentence. She was imprisoned. The judge told her she had &#8220;stolen from pensioners&#8221;.</p>
<p>Seema Misra, sub-postmistress, was prosecuted for theft and false accounting by the Post Office in 2010. She was eight weeks pregnant when she was found guilty and imprisoned. She collapsed on sentencing and had to go to hospital.</p>
<p>Tracy Felstead, sub-post office worker, was tried for theft and false accounting in 2002, aged 19. Her family had paid the &#163;11,500 she had allegedly stolen, on the understanding that this would mean no custodial sentence. Found guilty, Tracy refused to apologise. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/09/spent-months-prison-post-office-accused-theft-computer-bug/">She was imprisoned</a>.</p>
<h4>Lives torn apart</h4>
<p>The scandal of the Post Office and its Horizon computer system continues to unfold. The next chapter may depend on the determination of these three women. The evidence against them came from Horizon, which handles accounting in post offices. The system was developed by ICL, now Fujitsu, and introduced in the late Nineties. From that point there was an apparent explosion of crime in the UK&#8217;s 11,000 sub-post offices.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 900 sub-postmasters and others <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/25/post-office-review-900-convictions-subpostmasters/">were prosecuted in the criminal courts</a>,&#8221; says solicitor Nick Gould, representing Misra, Skinner and Felstead. &#8220;These were not prosecutions by the police and Crown prosecutors, but private prosecutions brought by Post Office lawyers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greater Manchester is to be placed into Tier 3 restrictions unilaterally, after the Government called off talks with local leaders&#160;without reaching a compromise.&#160;</p>
<p>Discussions went on after the midday deadline, and&#160;Boris Johnson&#160;himself intervened with&#160;two phone calls between him and Mayor&#160;Andy Burnham, before they were called off this afternoon.&#160;</p>
<p>It is understood that all pubs and bars will be shut for 28 days, unless they are serving substantial meals. Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres, and soft play areas will also be forced to close.</p>
<p>Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, said: &#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed that despite recognising the gravity of the situation, the Mayor of Greater Manchester has been unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control in Greater Manchester and reach an agreement with the Government.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have therefore advised the Prime Minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relations&#160;between the Government and leaders in the North are under increasing pressure as a result of these local lockdowns.&#160;</p>
<p>Shane Moore, the leader of Hartlepool Borough Council, said it was &#8220;untrue&#8221; that talks had begun with authorities about placing the region into Tier 3.&#160;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;No talks with us since update on Friday &amp; if anyone suggests it to me this week they'll be told to sod off.&#8221;</p>
<p>It comes after Labour MPs claimed the Government &#8220;hate Greater Manchester&#8221; during fiery Treasury questions with Rishi Sunak.&#160;</p>

In view of number of complaints from different segments of the society against immoral/indecent content on the video sharing application TikTok, pic.twitter.com/Vmp5umixeL — PTA (@PTAofficialpk) October 9, 2020

Previously too, the PTA chairman held an online meeting with the senior management of TikTok and lauded their previous efforts of taking down immoral content. But despite this the authority requested them to place more strict and staunch actions for content monitoring and moderation mechanism. Not only this PTA also published a notice to YouTube to immediately block vulgar, indecent, immoral, nude and hate speech content for viewing in the country. The notice further highlighted detrimental effects of easily available immoral content.

Many users believe banning the application isn’t the solution. More so, the authority needs to work on a strict compliance framework that can help with content moderation.

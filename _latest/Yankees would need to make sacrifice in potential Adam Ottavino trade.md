<div><p>Should the Yankees look for ways to shed payroll in an effort to drop below the $210 luxury tax for the 2021 season, they might be able to move Adam Ottavino.</p>
<p>According to several talent evaluators, teams would be interested in the right-hander but with the understanding the Yankees would have to absorb some of the $9 million owed to the soon-to-be 35-year-old Brooklyn native and Berkeley Carroll School product.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as he stays healthy, I am sure he can go somewhere else and re-establish himself in a real season,&#8217;&#8217; said an AL scout who was willing to discount the 60-game schedule of this past season due COVID-19 in which Ottavino posted a 5.89 ERA in 24 appearances.</p>
<p>To another AL scout, the full $9 million salary stops trade talks before they begin. However there is value for the team acquiring Ottavino if the sticker price drops.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was cheaper you could use him as a situational guy,&#8217;&#8217; the scout said of Ottavino, who fares better against right-handers than lefties and has difficulty holding runners.</p>
<p>This past season right-handed hitters batted .263 (15-for-57) and lefties .294 (5-for-17) against Ottavino, who will be a free agent following the 2021 season. Base stealers were 4-for-4 against him a year after swiping 15 bases in 16 attempts. Ottavino worked on not tapping his glove with the ball before delivering pitches in order to be quicker to the plate during the first spring training in March. He abandoned that during spring training 2.0.</p>
<p>A team looking for Ottavino to rebound for it would be thinking 2020 was a far cry from 2019, his first year in pinstripes.</p>
 
<p>This past season Ottavino gave up 20 hits, walked nine and struck out 25. Aaron Boone used him in just one of the seven postseason games for two-thirds of an inning. In 2019, Ottavino worked 73 games, produced a 1.90 ERA in 66 &#185;/&#8323; innings, allowed 47 hits, struck out 88 and walked 40.</p>
<p>Even if the Yankees were willing to eat some of the $9 million, it might take some time to find a trade partner because teams aren&#8217;t going to have an idea of what they can or cannot spend until they know what the financial landscape looks like given COVID-19. Will they be able to sell tickets? If so, will fans feel comfortable going to the ballpark?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are very few teams with cash, but most teams can&#8217;t do anything until they know how much income we will have from fans for next year,&#8217;&#8217; the second scout said.</p>
<p>As The Post&#8217;s Joel Sherman pointed out in <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/yankees-money-challenge-could-force-dj-lemahieu-split-sherman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunday&#8217;s column</a>, the Yankees have seven players signed for $117.5 million and 11 eligible for arbitration.</p>
<p>Free-agent pitchers James Paxton and J.A. Happ aren&#8217;t expected to return. If Brett Gardner, another free agent, comes back it will be likely for less than the $10 million he earned this past season. Should the Yankees not pick up Zack Britton&#8217;s 2022 option for $14 million three days after the end of the World Series, the valuable left-handed reliever can opt out of the $13 million due him for next year.</p>
<p>Then there is free agent DJ LeMahieu, the Yankees&#8217; most complete player who led the majors with a .364 batting average, who can play first, second and third base and is adored by teammates, coaches, Boone and the front office for his professionalism and production.</p>
<p>After making $12 million in each of the past two seasons, LeMahieu is in line for a raise. He indicated staying in The Bronx would be fine but all it takes is one team to blow any Yankees offer away.</p>
<p>Could that team be the Mets, who will be in the minority of teams with money to spend if/when Steve Cohen is approved by MLB owners?</p>

  Katherine Schwarzenegger Defends Chris Pratt After Brutal 'Hollywood Chris' Ranking 
description: > 
  “I’m actually at a point now where if I think that I am interacting with anybody who supports a man who tweets that when there are people who have lost loved ones and who are really sick and people who are still dying because of COVID, then I just don’t really know how I can understand how you can support an individual like that,” she wrote.“So, get thinking people.”Pratt, meanwhile, has continued to stay out of the political fray, having previously said that he doesn’t feel represented by Democrats or Republicans.

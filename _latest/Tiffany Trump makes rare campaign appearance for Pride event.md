<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more</p><p>Tiffany Trump, one of President Trump&#8217;s five children, is making waves on the internet for her first solo appearance as a campaign surrogate.</p>
<p>Trump, 27, appeared at a Trump Pride event in Tampa, Fla., over the weekend and delivered a 10-minute speech to the crowd, which she admitted to not having prepared for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully, like, the Trump genes run in me and I can just go up off script like my father likes to do, and honestly I love it when he gets off script,&#8221; she said to laughs and cheers from the crowd of about 150 people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such an honor to be able to be here and speak truthfully, honestly and from my heart. I know what my father believes in. Prior to politics, he supported gays, lesbians, the LGBQIA+ community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The younger Trump went on to bemoan the &#8220;fabricated lies&#8221; on social media about her family and her father&#8217;s presidency, saying, &#8220;It saddens me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have friends of mine who reach out and they say, they make up stories, &#8216;How could you support your father? We know you. We know your best friends are gay, we know your best friends are this, this, this.&#8217; I say, &#8216;It&#8217;s because my father has always supported all of you,&#8217;&#8221; she continued. &#8220;He&#8217;s never done it for politics and he&#8217;s not doing it for politics. And unfortunately, I think there&#8217;s a lot of people out there and other politicians who do, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since being a businessman, he speaks from the heart, he says what he says, he means it, perhaps it&#8217;s a little too, you know, just hardcore or just honest, but don&#8217;t we want someone who is going to get up there, speak and make it happen? I think so,&#8221; she continued.</p>
<p>Trump then discussed how she felt in 2015 when her father first announced that he was seeking the GOP nomination.</p>
<p>She admitted being worried at the time about &#8220;the past Republican establishment&#8221; and &#8220;their views toward this community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But guess what? My dad cannot be bought off. He&#8217;s not going to let anyone change his views. And he&#8217;s done that, and I pray that you all see that, truly,&#8221; she remarked to the audience in the must-win swing state.</p>
<p>Trump then pointed out her mother who was in the audience, President Trump&#8217;s second wife, Marla Maples.</p>
<p>Trump referenced Maples&#8217; days on Broadway as a performer at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, which took the life of one of her best friends.</p>
<p>She then touted President Trump&#8217;s pledge that there would be an AIDS vaccine within a decade, before praising him for making Richard Grenell <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/20/richard-grenell-joins-rnc-as-adviser-to-help-with-lgbt-outreach/">the first openly gay person</a> to serve in a US president&#8217;s cabinet.</p>
<p>Grenell was co-headlining the event with the younger Trump.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that should say a lot,&#8221; she argued before stating, &#8220;There should be love for all, one love, openly love. Come on, we&#8217;re all people, we&#8217;re all humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump, who is not frequently seen on the campaign trail, went on to explain why she decided to campaign for her father, saying that silence was not an option.</p>
 
<p>The recent Georgetown Law School graduate discussed feeling a fear about speaking out so as to not be accused of anything that would not be representative of who she was.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve learned is when you don&#8217;t speak and you do remain silent &#8212; and I used to think that was a strength &#8212; but when you don&#8217;t, they create their own narrative. The narrative that they want to sell to the world, and they&#8217;ve created that about me,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;So now I&#8217;m here to speak to you, because I&#8217;ve educated myself, I understand what I believe in now,&#8221; she said, adding, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to speak about politics or policies until I have my own beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He supports all of you, and we are here to fight for equality, democracy, to keep America and make it better.&#8221;</p>

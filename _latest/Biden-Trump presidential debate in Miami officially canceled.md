The second presidential debate in Miami between President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden has been canceled, according a new report.

The decision to scrap the Oct. 15 contest in the Sunshine State was made Friday after the commander in chief announced he was boycotting the debate when event organizers switched it to a virtual format, The Wall Street Journal reported.

“No, I’m not going to waste my time in a virtual debate,” Trump said on Fox Business on Thursday morning.

Hours later, Biden’s campaign announced the former veep would instead spent Thursday night at a solo ABC town hall with voters in Philadelphia, effectively killing the second contest.

Trump’s re-election campaign said they would be willing to take part in an in-person contest if they delayed the remaining two contests by one week, but Biden’s campaign rejected that proposal.

Trump 2020 and other top Republicans accused the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates of changing the format of the debate to help Biden who they have repeatedly accused of senility.

But the commission’s board said the decision was made to “protect the health and safety of all involved” after the president tested positive for COVID-19.

In open letters obtained by The Post, more than 175 physicians wrote to the commission this week saying they believed an in-person debate could be held safely and called on the organization to reverse their decision.

This is not the first time Trump has spiked a debate. In March 2016, Fox News was also forced to cancel a GOP debate in Salt Lake City when Trump declined to participate.

At this stage, the third Trump-Biden contest in Nashville on Oct. 22 is still going ahead.

According to CNN, Trump is in talks to take part in a solo NBC town hall on the night of the cancelled Miami meet-up.

The NTSB also faulted the Coast Guard for not enforcing that requirement and recommended it develop a program to ensure boats with overnight passengers actually have the watchman.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Last year's tragedy during a Labor Day weekend scuba diving excursion near Santa Cruz Island off Santa Barbara prompted criminal and safety investigations. Court documents say charges against the captain, Jerry Boylan, are imminent.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In a chilling revelation, investigators told the NTSB that because some of the recovered bodies were wearing shoes, they believe the victims were awake and trying to escape before being overcome with smoke. Both exits from the bunkroom were blocked by flames and coroner reports list smoke inhalation as the cause of death for all.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="The dive boat Conception is engulfed in flames in this Sept. 2, 2019, file photo provided by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department in California."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Board member Jennifer Homendy, who traveled to Santa Barbara in 2019 and toured a sister ship of the Conception, blasted Boylan and the owners, Truth Aquatics, during a virtual hearing on the investigation findings.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I hate the term accident in this case because, in my opinion, it is not an accident if you fail to operate your company safely," Homendy said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Before the disaster, Boylan and Truth Aquatics enjoyed a good reputation with customers and the Santa Barbara boating community. Coast Guard records show the Conception had passed its two most recent safety inspections.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Distress calls, mourning and the search for answers:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/03/california-boat-fire-what-happened-after-conception-left-harbor/2204738001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">&#160;How the California boat fire unfolded</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But NTSB investigators condemned the company and captain for a litany of issues including <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/17/california-boat-fire-crew-says-they-had-no-emergency-training/3477843001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">failing to train the crew on emergency procedures</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Clean up your act," NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said, referring to Truth Aquatics.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Attorneys for Boylan and Truth Aquatics did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Investigators said because the boat burned and sank, they couldn't determine what caused the fire. But they found it began toward the back of the main deck salon, where divers had plugged in phones, flashlights and other items with combustible lithium ion batteries.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Some people may walk away and say, 'Well, I wish I knew what the ignition source was,'" Homendy said. "But the key here is that the focus should be on conditions were present that allowed the fire to go undetected and to grow to a point where it prevented the evacuation."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jeffrey Goodman, a lawyer representing family members of nine victims, said the board's conclusions confirmed that the disaster was "predictable and preventable."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Truth Aquatics routinely violated federal law by failing to have a roving night watch," Goodman said in a statement.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Homendy and the other board members also sharply criticized the Coast Guard, saying insufficient rules &#8212; such as a lack of a requirement for interconnected smoke detectors in all accommodation spaces and poor emergency escape arrangements &#8212; need to be rectified.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Coast Guard records also show that since 1991, no owner, operator or charterer has been issued a citation or fine for failure to post a roving patrol, which the NTSB said means there isn't an effective system for checking the requirement and urged one be implemented.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We cannot let this disaster, this tragedy, go to waste," Sumwalt said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The families of 32 victims have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/13/conception-dive-boat-fire-lawyers-announce-findings-probe/4460508002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">filed claims against the boat owners</a>, Glen and Dana Fritzler, and Truth Aquatics. In turn, the Fritzlers and the company have filed a legal claim to shield them from damages under a maritime law that limits liability for vessel owners. Court filings show they have offered to settle lawsuits with dozens of victims' relatives.&#160;</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/local/2019/09/04/scenes-investigation-into-fatal-boat-fire/2210737001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

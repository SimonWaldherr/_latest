The day after Page Six claimed Bella Hadid and Duke Nicholson were 'spending time together since at least late last month' - she has now officially refuted the romance rumors.

The 24-year-old IMG Model - who's celebrating her birthday at an unknown tropical destination - is in fact 'single and not in a relationship' her rep confirmed to E! News on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, Bella reposted a checklist of how her 'goals have changed' including 'getting married when I am ready' rather than before age 30 and 'finding someone who I deeply connect with' rather than the most attractive.

Hadid has been single ever since ending her on/off romance with three-time Grammy winner The Weeknd in August 2019.

The Savage X Fenty Show catwalker and the 30-year-old Canadian crooner have since bumped into each other twice in Manhattan - backstage at the MTV Video Music Awards on August 30 and her 23rd birthday party in 2019.

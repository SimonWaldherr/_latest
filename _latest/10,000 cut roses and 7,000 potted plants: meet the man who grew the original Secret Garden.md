<div><p>When the first trailer for the new <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2020/10/20/secret-garden-review-get-family-cinema-sparkling-covid-antidote/">Secret Garden</a> film was released&#160;in March 2020, fans of the beloved 1993 version were shocked.&#160;</p>
<p>The children&#8217;s classic by Frances Hodgson Burnett &#8211; about a spoilt and unhappy little girl, Mary Lennox, who moves from India to live with her widowed uncle in his grand and gloomy Yorkshire mansion, hating every moment of it until she discovers a secret garden &#8211; has been adapted for the screen several times.&#160;</p>
<p>But it was Agnieszka Holland&#8217;s charming 1990s adaptation, beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, that stirred viewers' hearts: warm, delicate, earthen and sincere. Its walled English garden, the magnetic core of the film towards which everything gravitates and in which sickness is healed, enchanted adults and children alike with its moments of magic concealed within the ordinary.&#160;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s remake, starring Colin Firth and made by&#160;the producers of Harry Potter, revealed a garden riddled with CGI, with flowers growing fantastically as children sprint through overhanging leaves and tropically bright petals to a blockbuster action movie soundtrack utterly opposed to the original&#8217;s haunting score.&#160;Viewers took to the YouTube comments in a huff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the producers not heard of the phrase&#160;&#8216;less is more&#8217;?&#8221; reads one. &#8220;The story is powerful enough without needing to add unnecessary magic,&#8221; reads another. A third: &#8220;Another day, another classic movie butchered.&#8221;</p>

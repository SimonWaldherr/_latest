<div><h4>Joining the disrupters</h4>
<p>But joining the green-rush is no guarantee they will thrive, of course. Big questions marks hang over&#160;the oil giants&#8217; efforts&#160;to reinvent themselves.</p>
<p>Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal and General Investment Management, says:&#160;&#8220;Faced with any disruption, the natural response is to say, &#8216;we need to do that&#8217;... But it&#8217;s often better to say no, stick with your core business and leave the disruption to the disrupter.&#8221;</p>
<p>For oil and gas executives, steeped in the oil industry&#8217;s&#160;culture of geology and&#160;prospecting for&#160;crude, it&#8217;s quite a shift.</p>
<p>For decades, oil and gas bosses have been judged over the speed at which they can find new oil and gas reserves to replace those they have drilled out.</p>
<p>BP proved&#160;particularly good at it, averaging 100pc in the 1990s and 2000s ahead of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/12/27/deepwater-horizon-disaster-helped-save-bp/">the Deepwater Horizon disaster</a>.&#160;In contrast, in&#160;2004 Shell was fined &#163;83.6m by US and UK authorities for overstating its reserves.</p>
<p>These days, a different metric is gaining ground: the degree to&#160;which these companies&#160;can maintain returns while cutting their carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Both Shell and BP have set out bold ambitions. Shell&#160;says <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/shell-slashes-up-to-9-000-jobs-in-shift-towards-low-carbon-strategy-1.1086081">it will sell &#8220;some oil and gas&#8221;</a> by 2050 but the energy it sells will be &#8220;predominately&#8221; low-carbon electricity, low-carbon biofuels, hydrogen and other solutions.</p>
<p>BP, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/09/16/bp-drops-cluster-bomb-big-oil/">earned praise from Greenpeace for its plans, </a>which include cutting oil and gas production by 40pc by 2030 and developing 50GW of renewable power. That is&#160;up from just 2.5GW now, and more than the entire capacity in the UK as of June this year.</p>
<p>Both also want to generate net zero emissions from their own operations by 2050.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to change - and we want to change,&#8221; BP&#8217;s new, Instagram-friendly boss Bernard Looney has said. Its 19pc stake in Russia&#8217;s Rosneft, which accounts for about a quarter of its&#160;production,&#160;is excluded from its climate goals.</p>
<p>The pair will have to act to arrest the collapse in their share prices the pandemic&#8217;s impact on travel has prompted.</p>

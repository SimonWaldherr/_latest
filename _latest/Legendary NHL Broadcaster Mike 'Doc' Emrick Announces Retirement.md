<div><p></p><img alt="In this Wednesday, May 29, 2019, photo, NBC hockey broadcaster Mike Emrick poses for a photo while preparing to call Game 2 of the NHL hockey Stanley Cup Final between the St. Louis Blues and the Boston Bruins in Boston. At 72, still calling games on the NHL&#8217;s biggest stage, Emrick is in his prime and showing no signs of slowing down and stepping away from broadcasting the fastest game on ice. &#8220;I really wanted to do it from the time I saw my first game, but a lot of people really want to do something and they don't get to,&#8221; Emrick said. &#8220;When you have a job like that, you're never working the rest of your life. So it's been 46 years. I don't know when it'll end.

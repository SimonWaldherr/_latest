What happens when American swag meets Italian suave? The result is one of the season’s hottest hybrids, Fear of God Exclusively For Ermenegildo Zegna.

The cutting-edge Los Angeles streetwear upstart teamed with the century-old Milanese heritage brand on the unisex capsule, available now on Zegna and at select speciality and online stores. Cut from the finest fabrics and skins, the collection features relaxed, oversized jackets without revers; one-size-fits-all coats; and loose leather and suede outerwear, all in black or neutral grays and beiges. It looks just as cool on men as it does on women.

“I have always been fascinated by Ermenegildo Zegna clothing and this collaboration provides my clients with the opportunity to experience tailoring stitched with freedom, which I think Zegna customers will also enjoy,” says Jerry Lorenzo, founder of Fear of God.

Alessandro Sartori, artistic director of Zegna, says the synergy flowed between them. “We have worked with great balance, without our egos ever surpassing one another, to create a unique new wardrobe.”

Former sports agent and party promoter Lorenzo founded his cult label in 2013, going on to work with Kanye West on Yeezy Tour merch and fashion projects. He also designed custom show looks for Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” tour. His stonewashed, ripped jeans, band T-shirts, tracksuits and plaid shirts are rocked by everyone from Michael B. Jordan, Offset and Kendrick Lamar to David Beckham. Beyoncé even wore his thermals in her “7/11” video.

Meanwhile, MM6 — sister line of iconoclastic Paris house, Maison Margiela — and Denver-based outdoor specialist The North Face have also partnered on a mashup: MM6|The North Face. The garments were unveiled at the MM6 fall show in London earlier this year, and are cut generously enough to fit men or women. They’ll be available online and in key stores on Oct. 8.

The North Face’s signature Expedition System outerwear — detachable, layered pieces for extreme weather conditions — has been given the avant-garde treatment. The brightly colored coats have North Face’s recognizable black shoulder construction, are made with interlocking components that preserve the insulating properties and are stuffed with recycled down. But instead of the usual sporty shapes, these puffers are big, rounded and sculptural, in keeping with MM6’s house “circularity” theme.

Take the curved and zippered “Denali” fleece jacket, which has been lengthened into a coat-dress and cropped into a sweater. An innovative triple-zipper system allows wearers to fine-tune the sleeves and armholes. The jacket can also zip into the Mountain Kaban, a cape-style coat.

Warm, adjustable and conceptual clothing. That’s what happens when American high-performance gear collides with French high art.

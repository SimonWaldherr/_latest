<p>A Google Chrome feature that lets users guard their privacy by deleting personal data is sparing data from two websites: Google.com and YouTube, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/19/google_cookie_wipe/">Register</a> reports.</p><p>The Register report was based on a <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google.html">blog post</a> published by programmer Jeff Johnson in early October. Johnson found that a Chrome feature claiming to clear cookies and site data when you exit the browser was retaining data for both Google.com and YouTube, which is owned by Google.&#160;</p><p>

</p><p>To fix this manually, Johnson set Chrome to specifically delete Google and YouTube data by adding them to "Sites that can never use cookies" in his settings.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told the Register this was the result of a bug, and not Google giving itself a way to continue tracking privacy-minded users.</p>

<p>"We are aware of a bug in Chrome that is impacting how cookies are cleared on some first-party Google websites. We are investigating the issue, and plan to roll out a fix in the coming days," the spokesperson said.</p><p>Google was not immediately available to comment on how long this bug had existed when contacted by Business Insider.</p><p>It comes at a sensitive moment for Google. The tech giant &#8212; along with fellow Silicon Valley behemoths Apple, Facebook, and Amazon &#8212; was the target of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21505027/congress-big-tech-antitrust-report-facebook-google-amazon-apple-mark-zuckerberg-jeff-bezos-tim-cook">blockbuster Congressional antitrust report earlier this month</a>.&#160;</p><p>The report alleged that Google uses its various services to give itself an anti-competitive edge over other, smaller companies, resulting in an "ecosystem of interlocking monopolies."</p>

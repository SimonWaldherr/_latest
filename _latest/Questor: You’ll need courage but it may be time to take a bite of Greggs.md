<div><p>Benjamin Graham,&#160;the investment legend, wrote in his 1949 classic The&#160;Intelligent Investor: &#8220;The intelligent investor is a realist who&#160;sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems to this column that there is no shortage of pessimism around right now, especially as local lockdowns are imposed and public faith in flip&#8209;flopping government policy regarding how best to handle Covid-19 appears brittle at best.</p>
<p>The application of Graham&#8217;s maxim would therefore suggest that there could be a few bargains to be had in the London stock market, at least for those who are patient and willing to take a few knocks along the way.</p>
<p>One firm to catch the eye in this context is Greggs, the sandwiches to sausage rolls seller, not least because its shares are no higher than they were in 2015. It is easy to see <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/09/29/pandemic-brings-greggs-extraordinary-roll-abrupt-end/">why its shares are under pressure</a>.</p>
<p>The FTSE 250 firm&#8217;s shops were shut for most of the second quarter thanks to the pandemic and the nationwide lockdown, while management has reined in its store opening plans and the first-half results showed a pre-tax loss. In&#160;addition, the company&#160;passed its interim dividend.</p>
<p>Moreover, a nascent recovery after the carefully managed reopening of the estate from July onwards is now at risk. The Eat Out to Help Out scheme in August lured customers elsewhere and local&#160;lockdowns have been proposed&#160;for several cities and regions across Britain.</p>
<p>Greggs is responding. It has managed costs by limiting sales ranges (although they are expanding again) and is opening new shops where access by car is easy. It also now offers a click-and-collect service. The nationwide delivery partnership with Just Eat continues to develop. Unfortunately, some shops have been closed and some staff <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/09/29/greggs-warns-job-cuts-ahead-furlough-winds/">put on to a consultation process</a>.</p>
<p>It seems more than likely that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/uk-lockdown-three-3-tier-rules-restrictions/">restrictions on movement and social gatherings</a> will again hit trading and hence financial performance, especially as the nascent delivery business represents less than 3pc of in-store sales.</p>

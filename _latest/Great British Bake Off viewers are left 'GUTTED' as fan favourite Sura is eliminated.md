The Great British Bake Off viewers were left 'gutted' on Tuesday night after fan favourite Sura was eliminated in the 'harshest' week of judging yet.

The 31-year-old pharmacy worker failed to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith with her 'raw' white chocolate celebration cake for the Showstopper round.

Talking after her elimination, a tearful Sura said: 'I am gutted but what's done is done, I'm not going to be bitter about it, I've had a great time.'

On this week's the Great British Bake Off the theme was chocolate where the contestants had to start off by creating 12 brownies.

Despite appearing to be a simple task for the bakers, the talented hopefuls left Paul and Prue disappointed as not one person nailed the task.

With raspberry cheesecake, meringues and even figs being used to decorate the traybakes, not one contestant secured a Hollywood handshake.

In fact Paul and Prue were so disappointed by the creations, they didn't mince their feedback, with viewers at home calling it the 'harshest' week of judging yet.

When Kate Bosworth first started working in Hollywood she had to be told to pick out a 'fancy dress' for the red carpet.

But these days the 37-year-old is so up on fashion that she was able to style her own shoot for the November issue of InStyle.

The results were fabulous as the star - who said Gwyneth Paltrow was once her inspiration - modeled a string of eye-catching ensembles.

Evolution: When Kate Bosworth first started working in Hollywood she had to be told to pick out a 'fancy dress' for the red carpet

Kate's looks included a glittering black sequin dress with matching leather platform boots for one snap that showed her sitting on the floor.

In another picture she hinted at her trim midriff in an open white jacket blouse, matching her high-waisted flared trousers.

She was drawn to the theme of 'a girl who has had enough of quarantine' and wanted to bring 'a real staying-home-from-school feeling' to the shoot.

The sizzling sensation also found inspiration in the 1974 movie A Woman Under The Influence starring Gena Rowlands as a housewife who mentally unravels.

Legs for days: Kate's magazine looks included a glittering black sequin dress with matching leather platform boots for one snap that showed her sitting on the floor

Kate planned out her InStyle looks to the last detail because 'I’m a control freak,' she quipped to the magazine.

'But the real answer is I feel most fulfilled when I’ve earned something. I like the work, you know?' the ex-girlfriend of Orlando Bloom said.

Inside the magazine she talked through her fashion journey from when she was a teenager on the red carpet in 2000.

She confessed: 'Before I walked the red carpet for the premiere of Remember The Titans at age 16, someone had to explain to me that I’d need a fancy dress.'

Kate explained: 'I’m from a small Connecticut town, so my only concept of fashion was whatever store a normal teenager would shop at in the ’90s.'

The Win A Date With Tad Hamilton star was only on her second movie at that point but she had style in her blood as her father Harold was a fashion executive.

While picking out her red carpet look from the Giorgio Armani showroom, 'I was thinking how he would tell me: "Classic never goes out of style," when I picked an ankle-length skirt and a strappy velvet tank top.'

She shed light on one of her style inspirations of the period saying: 'I might have also been looking to Gwyneth Paltrow for inspiration.'

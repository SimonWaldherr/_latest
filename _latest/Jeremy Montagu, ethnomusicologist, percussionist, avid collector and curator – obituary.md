Jeremy Montagu, who has died aged 92, was the first musician to play under a conductor at the Royal Festival Hall when, during the original orchestral test concert in 1950, he sounded the side-drum roll at the start of the National Anthem, an exercise known then as “rolling up the King”.

Despite being an experienced timpanist, Montagu had only six weeks to master the side-drum. While God Save the King passed smoothly, he was unable to hear Leonard Friedman, the violin soloist, in Rimsky-Korsakov’s Capriccio Espagnol. “[I] kept trying to roll softer, which I hadn’t the skill to do, so the roll kept stopping,” he recalled, declaring the remainder of that test concert a disaster.

Undeterred, the opinionated and irascible Montagu went on to pursue an eclectic range of musical interests as scholar, collector, lecturer, writer, conductor, performer, and general enthusiast – often propelled by a quantity of snuff. Yet he retained a soft spot for the drums, working with a gypsy band one week, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra the next, and on film sessions with Maurice Jarre the week after.

He conducted amateur orchestras, directed choral groups and was honorary secretary and journal editor of the Galpin Society for those with an interest in organology. Other jobs included fixing players for the conductor Denys Darlow, Montagu recalling how “that could be a nightmare, finding enough flutes and oboes for two or even three simultaneous Matthew Passions on one weekend.”

Working as a music teacher was “a depressing business on the whole”. One pupil at a private girls’ school was desperate to please her father by playing an instrument, but failed at several before resorting to the drums. “She could hit, but she couldn’t count four in a bar,” Montagu recalled. There was also the “back-street state school” which was angry when he called the police after one of its pupils stole his wallet.

At another he slipped a local bus driver £10 to source a collection of oil drums that were pressed into service as a steel-drum set. There he set up a performance of Carmina Burana with other schools, but the Catholics, being familiar with Latin, pulled out, he recalled, “because their kids could understand the words”.

Montagu played with several ensembles including Musica Reservata, the pioneering early music ensemble for which he reconstructed medieval percussion instruments.

After a typical concert he was presented to the Queen Mother, who gently tapped the home-made drums, known as knackers, slung around his waist and asked: “What are those little things?” He replied: “Knackers, Ma’am” – and thereafter enjoyed relating that he was “one of the few men in London to have had his knackers tickled by the Queen Mum”.

A California mother missing for nearly two weeks in Zion National Park was found alive on Sunday, authorities said.

The National Parks Service said 38-year-old Holly Suzanne Courtier was reunited with her family on Sunday after rangers got a tip from a visitor saying they had spotted her in the Utah park.

Courtier had last been seen on Oct. 6, getting off a private shuttle van at an area leading to several Zion hiking trails. Authorities began searching for her after she she didn’t show up for her scheduled pickup.

Her family is “overjoyed” that she has been found safe.

“We would like to thank the rangers and search teams who relentlessly looked for her day and night and never gave up hope,” the family said in a statement.

“We are also so grateful to the countless volunteers who were generous with their time, resources and support. This wouldn’t have been possible without the network of people who came together.”

Her daughter, Kailey Chambers, previously said Courtier, an experienced hiker, had been traveling the country and visiting national parks since losing her job as a nanny because of the coronavirus pandemic.

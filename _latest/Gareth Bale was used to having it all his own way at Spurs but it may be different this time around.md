  Gareth Bale was used to having it all his own way at Spurs but it may be different this time around 
description: > 
  His hair in bun and wearing the No 9 - 30 days after re-signing - Bale was back home, seven years after departing for Real Madrid.As is it turns out, West Ham players and David Moyes didn’t need to worry.It’s how Tottenham supporters remember Bale.When Bale left for Spain, he was used to having all his own way.His 18 minute cameo maybe football’s way of telling him it’ll be different this time around.

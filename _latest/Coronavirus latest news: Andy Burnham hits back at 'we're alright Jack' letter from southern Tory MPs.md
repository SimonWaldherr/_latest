Andy Burnham has hit back at a "group of southern" Tory MPs who called for the Greater Manchester Mayor to "engage" with lockdown measures to prevent further restrictions in their constituencies.

He said the "we're alright Jack" letter from 20 Conservatives whose areas are currently under the lowest form of coronavirus restriction would not "cut much ice here".

Mr Burnham told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: "I would say to them some of them represent constituencies whose cases were higher than ours when we went into national lockdown."

Led by Jerome Mayhew, the MP for Broadland in Norfolk, the letter highlighted the "disparity" between some of their areas having coronavirus rates currently far lower than Manchester's.

Tory MPs, including some in Greater Manchester, criticised the letter as "unhelpful". William Wragg, whose Hazel Grove constituency is in Greater Manchester, recommended his colleagues "concern themselves with their own constituencies".

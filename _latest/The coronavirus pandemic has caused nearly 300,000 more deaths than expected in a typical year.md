Others have as well.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The data cover the period Feb.&#8201;1 to Sept.&#8201;16, meaning that excess deaths have almost certainly reached 300,000. Woolf said they are likely to hit 400,000 by the end of the year. The numbers were assembled by the National Center for Health Statistics, a unit of the CDC.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Outside analyses, including some by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/coronavirus-excess-deaths-may/?itid=ap_emmabrown&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_13">The Washington Post and researchers at Yale University</a>, have found two main causes for excess deaths. Many probably were the result of covid-19, although they were not recorded that way on death certificates. Others are probably the result of deaths at home or in nursing homes from heart attacks, diabetes, strokes and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, among people afraid to seek care in hospitals or unable to get it.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Overall, the CDC found &#8220;that excess deaths have occurred every week since March, 2020,&#8221; with a peak during the week of April&#8201;11 and another during the week ending Aug.&#8201;8. Those dates roughly coincide with the virus&#8217;s surge into the New York metro area near the start of the outbreak and a second major rise across the Sun Belt when many states reopened too soon in an effort to revive flagging economies.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The United States is in the midst of another sharp increase in coronavirus infections, this one centered in the upper Midwest and Plains states. The seven-day rolling average of cases, considered the most accurate barometer, is near 60,000 per day. At least 219,000 people have died of covid-19 so far, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic-guide-box&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_17">data kept by The Washington Post.</a></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">All told, an estimated 285,404 more people died than would be expected in a typical year, the CDC reported.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">While the virus continues to prey mainly on older people and, disproportionately, African Americans and Latinos, the rate of excess mortality among 25- to 44-year-olds was less expected.

The Premier League has expressed great concern at the potential for losing many academies in League One, League Two and the two that exist in the National League at Notts County and Yeovil Town. Under the auspices of the Elite Player Performance Plan, which has revolutionised player development in the English game, all 20 Premier League clubs, and 67 of the 72 in the Football League, run academies.

They offer boys an approved level of coaching, education and development and all are ranked and inspected under EPPP regulations. For many clubs they are an important supply line of first-team players and transfer revenue. On a wider scale, EPPP has helped produce the "Generation Millennium" - players born in 2000 such as Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Rhian Brewster who won the Under-17s World Cup in 2017.

EPPP regulations make it easier for the bigger clubs with the highest-ranked “category one” academies to sign the best junior players but they do so under a regulated tariff system. There is only one mention of EPPP in the PBP document – that funding for EFL clubs still participating in the scheme would receive EPPP funding as part of their new revenue share.

If all clubs in League One and below were no longer obliged to run and finance academies, the Premier League fears areas of the country could be without development opportunities for young players. The south-west, for instance, is currently served by academies at Yeovil as well as League One Plymouth Argyle, and League Two Exeter City who have produced some notable successes in recent years. Exeter academy graduates include the Wales international Ethan Ampadu, now on loan at Sheffield United from Chelsea. Also Torquay-born Ollie Watkins, a £28 million signing for Aston Villa this summer from Brentford.

The Premier League will tell members that the wealthiest clubs who would hold the balance of power under PBP would be able to force through rule changes to the geographical limitations on scouting boys. Currently all academy players up to U11s have to live within an hour’s journey of a club’s primary training centre. That goes up to 90 minutes for U11s to U14s. The rules were introduced to try to regulate the fierce competition in the youth development market.

There are around 12,000 boys in the EPPP system in clubs from the Premier League to the National League. Roughly half of them are in academies at clubs in League One and below. All category three and four academies - the two lowest tiers – employ between six and 10 full-time staff and between 10 and 15 part-time.

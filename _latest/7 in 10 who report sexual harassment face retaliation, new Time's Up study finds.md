  7 in 10 who report sexual harassment face retaliation, new Time's Up study finds 
description: > 
  Startlingly, one-third of workers (36%) said they experienced physical harassment, sexual assault, or rape.More than one in seven people (15%) were threatened with legal action, job loss, or physical harm if they revealed their harassment.The analysis is based on 3,317 requests for legal help submitted to Time's Up between Jan. 1, 2018, and April 30, 2020.In another Time's Up study, she noted, "four in five women say they’d report sexual harassment if it happened to them – even in the midst of this economic crisis since the pandemic.""If one thing’s clear, it’s that we’re never going back to the days where sexual harassment will remain hidden in the shadows – and that’s a good thing.”Contributing: The Associated Press

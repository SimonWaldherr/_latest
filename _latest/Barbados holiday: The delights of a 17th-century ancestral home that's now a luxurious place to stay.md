On the first floor, it concentrates on the grim Baijan experience of colonisation &#8212; sugar and slavery helping make the island 'the richest spote of lande in the worlde'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On our last night I asked my wife if she had felt the presence of her ancestors. 'Not quite,' she said, 'but strolling through the halls and gardens... it was easy to transport myself back to a time when this kind of quietly understated wealth and style left its imprimatur on my ancestors.'</p></div>

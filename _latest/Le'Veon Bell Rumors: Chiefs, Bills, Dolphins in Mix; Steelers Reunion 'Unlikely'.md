The Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins are reportedly the top contenders to sign free-agent running back Le'Veon Bell following his release from the New York Jets.

ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported the news Thursday and noted a reunion between Bell and the Pittsburgh Steelers is "unlikely at this point."

Coincidentally, the Jets' next three opponents are the Dolphins (Week 6), Bills (Week 7) and Chiefs (Week 8). Or perhaps it's not a coincidence as the three-time Pro Bowl selection attempts to show New York he's still an impact player after a forgettable 20-month tenure with the organization.

Bell suffered a hamstring injury in the team's season-opening loss to Buffalo. He spent the next three games on injured reserve before returning to face the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. He recorded 13 carries for 60 yards and one catch for seven yards in the 30-10 defeat.

Jets head coach Adam Gase was asked about the running back's usage, a common query over the past couple of years, following the team's decision to release him Tuesday.

"It's irrelevant at this point," Gase told reporters. "It didn't work out. It didn't work out. We're going to focus on this game right now."

Bell rushed 245 times for 789 yards (3.2 YPC) and three touchdowns for New York in 2019. He added 66 receptions for 461 yards and one score.

The Jets will move forward with Frank Gore, La'Mical Perine and Ty Johnson as their backfield options. Josh Adams may also get recalled from the practice squad for additional depth.

Meanwhile, Bell is probably heading toward a one-year, prorated deal for the remainder of 2020 in contrast to the four-year, $52.5 million contract he inked with the Jets in March 2019.

He'd likely be ticketed for a reserve role with any of the three main suitors. He'd work behind Devin Singletary in Buffalo, Clyde Edwards-Helaire in Kansas City or Myles Gaskin in Miami.

That could change over time, however, especially if he can showcase the type of game-changing, dual-threat playmaking ability he previously did with the Steelers.

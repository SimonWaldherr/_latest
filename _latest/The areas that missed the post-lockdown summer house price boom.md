<div><blockquote><strong>In this two-part series, we look at the micro-markets in England, Scotland and Wales that have&#160;recorded the biggest price changes this summer. Yesterday, we looked at where prices have <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/house-prices/local-hotspots-covid-has-sent-house-prices-soaring/">risen the&#160;most</a>; here, we find the areas where the "mini-boom" has fizzled</strong></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/house-prices/house-prices-jump-73pc-september-nearly-250000-boom-cant-last/">post-lockdown property &#8220;mini-boom&#8221;</a> has been well-documented. But not every area was <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/mortgage-wait-times-soaring-putting-homebuyers-risk-losing/">riding the house price wave</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Using an exclusive dataset from property website Zoopla, we have analysed the local authority areas that the property surge has left behind.</p>
<p>In some regions such as the Midlands and the South West, there are no real losers of the boom. But in other parts of the country, supply is rising far more quickly than demand &#8211; and these&#160;micro-markets could be a bellwether for the future of British house prices as a whole.</p>
<h3>The South</h3>
<p>The "mini-boom" in the property market&#160;is largely due to the desire for larger homes, outdoor space and for suburban and rural&#160;living after lockdown. But <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/london-house-prices-could-hit-hard-coronavirus-demand-country/">these same trends</a> have hit demand for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/selling-country-house-moving-back-london-lockdown/">central London property</a>.</p>
<p>In the City of London, prices fell by 0.7pc in August. It was the second-lowest rate of growth of any local authority in Britain.</p>
<p>Supply has soared, making it into a buyers' market &#8211; if there were any. Tony Gambrill, of Chestertons estate agents, said that across central London &#8220;there is a tsunami of property coming onto the market&#8221;.</p>
<p>For owner-occupiers in the City, the rise of working from home has ended the appeal of living close to offices. &#8220;People want to sell because they don&#8217;t want to be living in a soulless concrete jungle that nobody is going to,&#8221; said Mr Gambrill. &#8220;Even the small convenience shops have mostly closed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, travel restrictions are holding back both the overseas purchasers who normally account for a large share of central London sales, and the international students who&#160;rent. Inner London rents have plunged, and many landlords are selling up empty properties, creating&#160;a&#160;glut of one-bedroom flats on the market.</p>
<p>As the supply of homes for sale rises, Mr Gambrill expects values to fall a further 5pc to 10pc in the next six months.</p>

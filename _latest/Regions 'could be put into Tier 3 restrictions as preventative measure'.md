<div><p>Areas could be placed into <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/21/tier-3-lockdown-rules-high-alert-areas-restrictions/">Tier 3 lockdown</a> as a preventative measure before they have met threshold triggers, the director general of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) has said.</p>
<p>Dr Clare Gardiner said talks with council leaders and local directors of public health to introduce "prophylactic action" to stop <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-covid-lockdown-manchester-tier-3-uk-cases-deaths/">case numbers rising</a> were ongoing.</p>
<p>The JBC, which was given responsibility for guiding the response to the virus in June, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/12/mps-demand-answers-dido-harding-secretive-body-driving-local/">has been criticised for its lack of transparency</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the science and technology select committee, Dr Gardiner promised to publish the case number and positivity levels that would trigger higher tiers, but said the decision was largely down to "professional judgments" rather than "hard thresholds".</p>
<p>She warned that some areas could be placed in higher restriction bands even if they did not meet the requirements.</p>
<p>"There are a number of other areas where one wants freedom to move to the upper tiers," she said. "Preventative or prophylactic action is another reason, and at some of our local meetings directors of public health, in consultation with council leaders, are proposing to move from a prevention perspective even if they may not have met some of these soft triggers."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Government confirmed that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/west-south-yorkshire-tier-2-leeds-sheffield-local-lockdown-rules/">South Yorkshire is moving into the highest level of coronavirus restrictions</a> from midnight on Saturday after local leaders secured &#163;41 million in funding from the Government.</p>

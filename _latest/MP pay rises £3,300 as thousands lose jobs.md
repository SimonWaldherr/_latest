A business minister has suggested that MPs should donate a £3,300 pay rise as he branded the increase “inappropriate.”

Nadhim Zahawi on Friday hit out at the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority after it proposed that MPs’ wages should continue to be linked to the average rise for public sector staff.

It is expected to base next year’s pay rise on October’s public sector three-month annual growth figure of 4.1 per cent.

This would mean MPs are likely to receive a rise of £3,360, taking their salaries to £85,291. They have already been given a pay rise in each of the last six years.

The move has provoked a backlash among MPs, who are particularly conscious of the public mood amid a major economic recession and waves of redundancies caused by the pandemic.

Asked about the proposal, Mr Zahawi told Sky News: "I don’t think a pay rise is appropriate. I think it’s a privilege in many ways to serve your country.

“It’s independent but I think it’s incumbent on the leadership of IPSA to also explain to the public…. as to why they think this is the right thing to do.

‘They have to also explain themselves because they also exist in the court of public opinion.

“I would certainly look at donating it to one of my very good causes - maybe the Shakespeare Hospice in Stratford.”

However, Mr Zahawi insisted that it was right that IPSA, which was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal in 2009, continued to set the salaries of MPs.

He was joined by his Labour counterpart Lucy Powell, who said she would also donate the extra money to charity if it was awarded.

Dehenna Davidson, the Conservative MP for Bishop Auckland, added: “This is literally the first I’ve heard of this and I think it’s a bloody stupid decision.

“But here’s my regular reminder that we as MPs do not decide how much we get paid. It’s decided by an independent body - and I think they should have better judgement.”

Asked if the Prime Minister would donate his salary, his deputy spokesman told reporters: “I haven’t asked him this morning but obviously the matter of MPs’ pay rises is a matter for IPSA.”

Defending the move, Richard Lloyd, the interim chairman of IPSA, said that the proposal was justified “given the huge economic uncertainties arising from the coronavirus pandemic.”

“We do not think it is right to depart from this approach now,” he continued.]

"We act independently of parliament and have a statutory duty to review MPs' pay in the first year of each parliament.”

But Jeremy Hutton, policy analyst at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: "IPSA must be tin-eared if it really thinks a pay rise for MPs should be considered this year.

"Public finances are in a parlous state, furlough is coming to an end and unemployment is rising.

"A pay rise in parliament would be an insult to hardworking taxpayers who've had a very tough year."

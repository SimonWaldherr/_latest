A travel writer has said he received "such intense abuse" when he suggested people visit Wales that he has "no further plans" to book a stay in the country.

Speaking on ITV earlier this week, Simon Calder listed Gwynedd and Ceredigion, as well as Belfast and Edinburgh, as places people in the UK could go for a break during the pandemic.

But he said he then received a torrent of abuse via email and social media.

Visit Wales said it was trying to welcome people back "in a way that is safe".

In an article for The Independent , Mr Calder said he had replied to many of the hundreds of people who messaged on social media and understood the deep concern about the spread of coronavirus, but did not now intend to book a holiday in Wales again.

Mr Calder said he had never meant to upset anyone and had followed travel advice, but it was an "interesting lesson" on current sensitivities.

He added: "The hundreds of people I inadvertently angered may be glad to hear that I have no further plans to book a stay in Wales."

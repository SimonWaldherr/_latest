Sales in China slipped in September, despite price cuts.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Aly Song/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla on Wednesday reported a profit for the fifth consecutive quarter, putting it on track to report its only annual profit since its founding in 2003.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla said it made $331 million, or 27 cents per share, in the three months that ended in September. The company reported a profit of $143 million, or 16 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The company delivered 139,600 cars in the third quarter. That was a roughly 50 percent increase from the second quarter, when sales and production were severely hampered by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Tesla faces questions about whether that strong sales growth is tapering off. Analysts believe Tesla&#8217;s sales in the United States have already slowed, and they have said it may be suffering from sluggishness in other parts of the world. In China, Tesla has cut prices several times this year and sales of the Model 3 sedans it makes in Shanghai declined slightly in September compared with August and July. And in Europe, the company faces growing competition from traditional automakers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Tesla is losing ground in Europe to fierce competitors&#8221; that have offered more affordable electric models, Vicki Bryan, the chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said in a report before the company&#8217;s earnings report. Ms. Bryan also said Tesla&#8217;s Model Y hatchback seemed to be taking sales away from the Model 3 rather than adding to the company&#8217;s sales.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The company&#8217;s chief executive, Elon Musk, last month appeared to temper expectations when he forecast that sales would rise 30 to 40 percent this year, implying a range of 482,000 to 514,000 cars.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla would have to sell 182,000 cars in the fourth quarter to sell more than 500,000 cars for the year. Most analysts expect sales for the full year to fall short of that mark, however. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company delivered 112,000 cars.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While several automakers have introduced electric vehicles, Tesla so far has faced little serious competition. But that could change over the next year or so.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Tuesday, General Motors offered a preview of a battery-powered and technology-packed Hummer pickup truck that it plans to begin selling in about 12 months. The Hummer EV is supposed to go 350 miles or more on a full charge &#8212; in line with Tesla&#8217;s top models.  G.M. promises the truck will be able to charge enough in 10 minutes to travel 100 miles.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The first edition will start at $112,595. Other editions due in 2022 and later will be available for under $100,000.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Hummer EV is meant to compete with Tesla&#8217;s pickup, the Cybertruck, which is supposed to go into production late next year. Ford Motor, Rivian and other automakers are also hoping to bring electric pickup trucks to the market soon.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neal-e-boudette" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="stimulus-talks"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#stimulus-talks">White House says aid to states and cities is the biggest stimulus sticking point.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/business/21markets-brf-stimulus/merlin_178837629_a1a8cc1a-b0e0-4bed-8a09-e5d050c5fc23-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Pool photo by Chris Kleponis/EPA, via Shutterstock</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said on Wednesday that a call by Democrats for hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid for states and cities and their resistance to a liability shield for businesses remained the toughest obstacles to a stimulus deal.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The biggest issue remains state and local assistance,&#8221; Mr. Meadows said on the Fox Business Network. &#8220;That remains a stumbling block.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">His remarks came hours before <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/stimulus-deal-mitch-mcconnell-nancy-pelosi.html" title="">Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin</a> were scheduled to continue talks on a broad pandemic relief package in hopes of reaching a deal this week, even as congressional Republicans fought to prevent such a compromise from materializing before Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Mnuchin, who is returning from a trip to the Middle East, and Ms. Pelosi planned to speak later on Wednesday. The two sides have been trying to reach an agreement on another round of economic aid that could be enacted before Nov. 3. But Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has told the White House to abandon its efforts, concerned about the political fallout for Republicans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Meadows suggested that progress was being made, but said he feared that politics could get in the way. Ms. Pelosi on Tuesday signaled that Democrats were preparing counteroffers on both liability protections for businesses that are seeking to reopen and state and local funding.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The White House has proposed providing $250 billion to states and municipalities, Mr. Meadows said, while House Democrats have called for double that. He also said that the liability protections were a crucial priority for Republicans, and he chided Ms. Pelosi for resisting them, saying she was being &#8220;disingenuous&#8221; if she believed that his party would agree to any deal without them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Even as Republicans resisted a compromise, pressure was mounting from rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties to reach one. A bipartisan group of House lawmakers on Wednesday wrote to congressional leaders and Mr. Trump urging a resolution before the November elections.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We know there may be remaining issues to be resolved between the negotiators, but it appears those issues are certainly solvable,&#8221; the group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, wrote. &#8220;Our families, businesses, and local communities don&#8217;t have the luxury of time so Washington can continue its partisan games. We must do our job and do it now.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Across the Capitol, Senate Democrats blocked a move by Republicans to advance a $500 billion plan that would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits and a popular federal loan program for small businesses, as well as provide additional money for testing. Democrats, who have argued the package falls far short of the level of aid needed, unanimously opposed it, and it fell short on a party-line vote of 51-44, failing to clear the 60-vote threshold required to move forward.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-rappeport" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="the-easiest-part-of-the-labor-markets-recovery-is-likely-behind-us-a-fed-governor-says"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#the-easiest-part-of-the-labor-markets-recovery-is-likely-behind-us-a-fed-governor-says">The easiest part of the labor market&#8217;s recovery is likely behind us, a Fed governor says.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Lael Brainard, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/business/21markets-brainard/merlin_146140461_da6ed885-4690-437c-b862-97fed2f08d6a-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Lael Brainard, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who is seen as a possible future Treasury secretary if former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wins the election, warned in a speech Wednesday that &#8220;the easiest<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>improvements&#8221; in the labor market &#8220;are likely behind us.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Brainard pointed out that the share of permanent layoffs is rising &#8212; bad news because it takes longer to rehire those workers than people who have temporarily lost their jobs &#8212; and that unemployment insurance claims have ticked up. She also noted that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/02/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/women-dropped-out-of-the-labor-market-as-child-care-loomed-large" title="">participation rates for women</a> in their prime working years have fallen.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That decline &#8220;could have longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth,&#8221; she said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A shortfall in government support could pose a major risk to the pace of the economic rebound, Ms. Brainard said, especially if additional help comes after hard-hit households burn through the savings they built up earlier in the crisis.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">&#8220;</strong>Apart from the course of the virus itself, the most significant downside risk to my outlook would be the failure of additional fiscal support to materialize,&#8221; she said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Economists often refer to the economic rebound underway as K-shaped, meaning that it is sharply divided. Some people have held onto their jobs, watched their savings rise and maintained basically normal consumption patterns despite some pandemic-spurred modifications. But another broad segment of workers has lost jobs and seen its labor income dry up. While many such households <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/upshot/stimulus-checks-unemployment.html" title="">are now living off</a> savings from earlier government support, those funds will not last forever. Likewise, many big businesses are doing well, even as smaller companies and those in hard-hit sectors struggle.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Further targeted fiscal support will be needed alongside accommodative monetary policy to turn this K-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery,&#8221; Ms. Brainard said. &#8220;The most important message is simply that we will have a much better, stronger, more inclusive recovery if we do continue to see that targeted fiscal support&#8221; alongside Fed policy.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeanna-smialek" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="purdue-pharma-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charges-for-opioid-sales"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#purdue-pharma-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charges-for-opioid-sales">Purdue Pharma pleads guilty to criminal charges for opioid sales.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Family and friends of people lost to opioid overdoses protested outside Purdue Pharma&#8217;s headquarters in Stamford, Conn., in 2018." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/science/21PURDUE/merlin_159958377_7cf1d221-a2a1-4f4a-8489-5243bf895054-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Family and friends of people lost to opioid overdoses protested outside Purdue Pharma&#8217;s headquarters in Stamford, Conn., in 2018.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Jessica Hill/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/health/purdue-opioids-criminal-charges.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges</a> of defrauding federal health agencies and violating <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-investigation-opioids-e/exclusive-oxycontin-maker-purdue-is-pharma-co-x-in-u-s-opioid-kickback-probe-sources-idUSKBN1ZR2RY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anti-kickback laws</a>, and faces penalties of roughly $8.3 billion, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The company&#8217;s owners, members of the wealthy Sackler family, will pay $225 million in civil penalties.</p><p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Wednesday&#8217;s announcement does not conclude the extensive litigation against Purdue, but it does represent a significant advance in the long legal march by states, cities and counties to compel the most prominent defendant in the opioid epidemic to help pay for the public health crisis that has resulted in the deaths of more than 450,000 Americans since 1999, according to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/analysis.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, it is unlikely the company will end up paying anything close to the $8 billion negotiated in the settlement deal.

In return, Google paid Apple a chunk of the ad revenue it collected from the millions of Google searches conducted on iPhones.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Today that arrangement covers all Apple devices, which now account for nearly half of all Google search traffic, according to the Justice Department&#8217;s lawsuit. As a result, Google pays Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion a year, according to the suit. That has made Apple and Google hugely reliant on one another, while edging out other search engines and, according to the U.S. government, protecting Google&#8217;s monopoly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;By paying Apple a portion of the monopoly rents extracted from advertisers, Google has aligned Apple&#8217;s financial incentives with its own and set the price of bidding for distribution extraordinarily high &#8212; in the billions,&#8221; the Justice Department said in its lawsuit.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With billions of dollars on the line, the partnership is critical to both companies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With billions of dollars on the line, the partnership is critical to both companies.

While some analysts had predicted that Snap&#8217;s growth would tail off as people returned to school, its number of daily active users rose 18 percent to 249 million. But the company posted a net loss of nearly $200 million in the quarter, narrower than the loss of $227 million a year ago.

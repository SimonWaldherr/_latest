 <p>     </p> <p>"They soldier on, there's a great sense of camaraderie amongst all the staff within the hospital."</p> <p>Ms McStein said she felt the virus was now "unrelatable" for the general public.</p> <p>"I don't think they appreciate the extent of what the NHS is going through and I think it's disheartening to see people protesting and people going against the rules and regulations because we are definitely seeing the impact that's having on people now," she said.</p> <p>The hospital's medical director Rowan Pritchard Jones said there were concerns about whether communities were following advice.</p> <p>He said: "It is so difficult for those of us who walk in every day to care for the most critically ill patients that we know someone sprayed 'hoax' on the side of a town hall. But they have.</p>

   <p>"We work really hard to be upfront with our community who we are here to care for. We need them to do their bit as well to try and manage these numbers."</p> <p>Mr Pritchard Jones said the last fortnight had seen the biggest rate of change of Covid-19 patients, bringing them almost back to the levels of earlier in the year, but fewer patients were now on ventilators due to developments in treatment.</p> <p>He said: "This doesn't feel like the sprint that maybe we started out on earlier in the spring.&#160;</p> <p>"It feels far more like a marathon with some difficult hill climbs partway through it and I feel like we're on one now."</p>

   <p> Clinical director of intensive care Dr Ascanio Tridente said there were more than 120 patients with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> in the hospital, compared with fewer than 10 at the start of September. </p> <p>He said the pressures had taken a "significant toll" on staff but he was confident they would "pull through this together".</p> <p>He said: "We have seen this before, we know what it looks like, we know what the treatments that are likely to work are.</p> <p>"At the same time, we also know how deadly it can be and that it is serious and must not be underestimated."</p> <p>Emergency medicine consultant Dr Andy Ashton said positive coronavirus cases in the health trust doubled every week for the first four weeks from September and were now increasing at a rate of 60% per week.</p>

   <p>He said: "I think people have let out a big, long sigh and realised that we're in for another long, hard winter."</p> <p>Dr Hannah Coles, also an emergency medicine consultant, said there was a better understanding of what they were dealing with for coronavirus patients and urged people with other health conditions to continue to come to the hospital if they needed urgent treatment.</p> <p>She said: "If patients are unwell and they feel they need to be seen then they should still attend the emergency department and they need to be reassured that they will still be seen and managed when they do come to us."</p> <p>NHS testing lab scientist Lydia Newhall, from the St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said the situation is 'worse than it was in April'.</p>

   <p>Ms Newhall's team told the PA news agency they deal with more than 1,000 samples in a day from NHS patients and staff.</p> <p>Tests are turned round within 24 hours, although a small proportion of them, in cases when they have been requested by a consultant, can be carried out in 90 minutes, she said.</p> <p>She said: "Every week the number of tests is just getting more and more, I can't even describe how many boxes we've got in today.</p> <p>"Last night I had over 600 samples just on the night shift so you're talking over 1,000 now a day.</p>

   <p>"The past three or four weeks it has been a huge increase in positive cases, especially the past week or two."</p> <p>The laboratory, based at Whiston Hospital, is the only one in the country to operate throughout the night, Miss Newhall said.</p> <p>The scientist, who has worked at the hospital full-time for two years, has gone from working day shifts as she completes her training to covering all hours to deal with the increased workload.</p> <p>She said some colleagues were off work because they had to isolate, or in some cases had contracted coronavirus, meaning even more pressure on the existing team.</p>

   <p>"The pressure's built up more recently.</p> <p>"Everyone has felt a bit like 'oh here we go again' and this time it is worse than it was in April," she said.</p> <p>A medical director at St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said the need to continue operations at the same time as treating coronavirus patients has "significantly complicated" the second wave.</p> <p>Rowan Pritchard Jones told the PA news agency he was "desperate" to keep operating theatres up and running despite rising numbers of coronavirus patients.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>He said: "The entire situation is significantly complicated by the fact that first time round, as the Government directed us all to, we stopped everything else.</p> <p>"We emptied the hospital out, we cancelled all the operations that weren't pure emergencies, we stopped outpatients.</p> <p>"This second wave is rolling up the beach just at the time we are desperate to restore those urgent services and see those patients whose treatment was deferred and delayed first time round."</p></div>

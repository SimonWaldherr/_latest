Vasiliy Lomachenko takes on Teofimo Lopez with all the belts on the line that matter in boxing's lightweight division on October 17 at The Bubble at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

Lomachenko vs. Lopez is a rare gem in the boxing world. It's a fight between two elite world champions who would probably be wise to avoid facing each other but are deciding to risk it all for the glory anyway.

Lomachenko, 32, from Ukraine, and Lopez, 23, from Brooklyn, New York, are set to do battle for Loma's WBA, WBC and WBO titles and Lopez's IBF title belt. The winner will also earn Lomachenko's The Ring magazine lightweight championship as well as the vacant Transnational Boxing Rankings Board title.

What does all that mean?

Well, it means Lomachenko vs. Lopez is probably the most important boxing event of the whole year.

Better yet, the fight will be televised live on ESPN instead of pay-per-view.

Best yet, the winner will be crowned the first undisputed 135-pound boxing champion among the men since Pernell Whitaker accomplished the feat 30 years ago.

Behold, Bleacher Report's predictions for the big fight.

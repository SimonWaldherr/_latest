  Ghislaine Maxwell loses bid to keep Epstein deposition secret 
description: > 
  Lawyers for Ms Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment, including whether they plan a further appeal.Ms Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls as young as 14 to engage in illegal sexual acts in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for having denied involvement in the deposition.Ms Giuffre said she was a teenager when Ms Maxwell pulled her into Epstein's circle, where she was groomed and trafficked for sex with Epstein and other wealthy, powerful men.Ms Maxwell was arrested on 2 July in New Hampshire, where prosecutors said she had been hiding out.The cases in the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals are Giuffre v Maxwell, No 20-2413, and US v Maxwell, No 20-3061.

  Rio Ferdinand heaps praise on Manchester United match winner Marcus Rashford 
description: > 
  Manchester United's matchwinner in Paris, Marcus Rashford, is capable of progressing even further and becoming a truly world class player, according to club legend Rio Ferdinand.Ferdinand believes that, with the addition of a 'poacher's element' to his repertoire, Rashford is fully capable of ascending to stardom.'Wayne Rooney scored outrageous goals when he joined United, he didn't score ugly goals but then he got that into his game to add to his repertoire.'If he [Rashford] can get that ugly side, this kid can go on to be unbelievable.'Rashford himself would not be drawn over his preferred choice from his two memorable strikes at the Parc des Princes, however.

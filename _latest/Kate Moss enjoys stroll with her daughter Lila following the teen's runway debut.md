Her daughter recently stunned audiences across the world as she made her runway debut at Miu Mui's Spring/Summer 2021 presentation during Paris Fashion Week.

And Kate Moss and her only child Lila returned back to normality as they enjoyed a stroll in north London following an exciting week.

The supermodel, 46, exuded effortless style in a light brown trench coat as she and her lookalike, 18, coordinated in protective face masks.

Cutting a typically chic figure, the catwalk star sported a black jumper, denim jeans and cowboy-inspired boots.

Kate carried her essentials in a quilted designer handbag, and accessorised with square-framed shades.

Lila, meanwhile, followed in her parent's fashionable footsteps as she teamed a dark crop top with bell bottoms and boots.

The teen, who celebrated the milestone birthday just last week, appeared a natural fit for the catwalk as she strutted her stuff at Miu Miu's virtual event.

Kate first hit the runway at the same age as her mini-me in 1992, after being scouted as a 14-year-old in 1988 at JFK Airport in New York.

The fashion icon first walked for Dolce & Gabbana in their spring show, in a blue brocade suit teamed with a matching wide-brimmed hat.

The Vogue coverstar became a stalwart on the runway during the nineties and regularly appeared for big name designers including Prada, Tommy Hilfiger and Stella McCartney.

Fashionistas are reportedly suggesting that Kate is masterminding her daughter's style and her fledgling career, according to the Mail On Sunday.

Industry sources reported that Kate's priorities have shifted from her own career to launching her only daughter onto the fashion scene.

Lila is the principal client at the Kate Moss Agency, which also boasts singer Rita Ora and Game Of Thrones actress Gwendoline Christie.

<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Controversy reigned once again this weekend, after an incredible Merseyside derby which was overshadowed by Virgil van Dijk's serious injury, caused by Jordan's Pickford's reckless lunge. It led to a flurry of questions arriving in <a href="/sport/peter-crouch/index.html" id="mol-7a7ac780-11e2-11eb-888b-374b003ddd68">Peter Crouch</a>&#8217;s inbox and prompted some strong opinions from Sportsmail&#8217;s columnist.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He&#8217;s had enough of VAR&#8230; but he also knows a secret Burger King.</p><img id="i-31bc49989be8f7" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="533" width="634" alt="Peter Crouch answers more of your questions as part of a weekly series here for Sportsmail" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-31bc49989be8f7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/28/08/26219030-8778867-Peter_Crouch_answers_more_of_your_questions_as_part_of_a_weekly_-a-22_1601277045599.jpg" height="533" width="634" alt="Peter Crouch answers more of your questions as part of a weekly series here for Sportsmail" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Peter Crouch answers more of your questions as part of a weekly series here for Sportsmail</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How pivotal will Virgil van Dijk&#8217;s injury be?&#160; &#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">Liam W via Twitter</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It&#8217;s huge, Liam, an absolutely massive blow.

I called it a leg-breaker on BT Sport and I haven&#8217;t changed my mind.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That was the kind of challenge that can end a career and it gave me an indication of Pickford&#8217;s state of mind. He is a keeper whose confidence has evaporated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Watch the incident again.

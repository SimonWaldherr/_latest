<div><p>Humanity on the radio is so refreshing. This week&#8217;s castaway on <strong>Desert Island Discs</strong> (Radio 4, Sunday) was Averil Mansfield, the first British woman to be appointed a professor of surgery. She is a fascinating person; now in her eighties, she is a keen lifelong musician as well as a doctor, clever and wry, quite private, compassionate and precise.</p>
<p>Growing up in the 1940s, her school report as a child had said, unpromisingly, &#8220;she will never learn to sew&#8221;. (Her job involved rather a lot of sewing in the end.) She had lots of stories about people not believing that she was really their surgeon, but: "you do need to retain a sense of humour in this thing, otherwise all is lost.&#8221; Her luxury item was a piano, because she remembered her father&#8217;s words: &#8220;You should always have a piano because you can play it, you can eat off it, and you can sleep under it&#8221;.</p>
<p>In <strong>Reading the Water</strong> (Radio 4, Thursday), we were in the company of fisherman and writer Chris Yates as he attempted to catch a carp the size of &#8220;a small submarine&#8221; in a secluded lake during lockdown, to the sounds of rippling water, rustling oak leaves, wood pigeons and kingfishers.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fishing is not an escape, it&#8217;s just a way of changing direction slightly&#8230; now and then I just want to be renewed,&#8221; he said. Once, he experimented with playing music to the carp. He turned on some Schumann on Radio 3, &#8220;and they loved it, I could tell! They all pointed towards me". But then he accidentally switched the radio to French pop and they all swam away in disgust. Like Desert Island Discs, it was a joy; a quiet restoration of faith in human nature.</p>

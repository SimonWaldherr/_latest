</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;I will be entirely apolitical as the director of national intelligence,&#8221; Ratcliffe, now the Director of National Intelligence, pledged.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Fast forward five months, and after releasing a raft of previously classified documents in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-intelligence.html">an apparent attempt to undermine the investigation</a> into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Ratcliffe is now apparently willing to do whatever it takes to boost his boss&#8217; re-election bid.</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;Hunter Biden's laptop is not part of some Russian disinformation campaign," Ratcliffe told Fox Business on Monday.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>A laptop allegedly belonging to the oldest son of Democratic nominee Joe Biden is at the center of a political storm after the New York Post last week published based on emails and other details taken from the computer &#8212; which may or may not belong to Hunter Biden.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>The FBI, which was contacted by the owner of a repair shop in Delaware where the laptop was handed in to be fixed, subpoenaed the contents of the hard drive, though it is unclear why they did so.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>But before handing it over to the FBI, the store owner made a copy of the hard drive, which he then gave to Rudy Giuliani, who passed it to the Post.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>The unverified contents of the hard drive have already <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9z4a/qanon-is-running-the-pizzagate-playbook-with-hunter-biden">fueled wild new conspiracy theories</a> online, and Ratcliffe&#8217;s comments are likely to help boost those claims, even though he admitted that he knew &#8220;little&#8221; about the case and that the intelligence community &#8220;has not been involved&#8221; in the investigation.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>At a time when disinformation threatens to undermine the credibility of next month&#8217;s presidential election, Ratcliffe&#8217;s comments are at best premature, and at worst, playing right into the hands of the Kremlin.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>The FBI is reportedly investigating the possibility of Russian involvement in the Biden case, but these investigations typically take weeks or months. Ratcliffe&#8217;s premature comments &#8220;violated several cardinal rules&#8221; of the intelligence community, according to Ned Price, a former CIA intelligence analyst who served as a National Security Council spokesperson and Special Assistant to President Barack Obama.&#160;</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;Among them, he inserted himself in the middle of a partisan issue, he at the very least lent the appearance that he was boosting the President's campaign, and he appears to have gotten ahead of intelligence analysis and law enforcement investigations,&#8221; <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2020/10/intelligence-experts-suspicious-dni-ratcliffe-laptop-story/169378/">Price told Defense One</a>.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Ratcliffe&#8217;s comments have already been used by right-wing figures and websites as evidence to back up the claims made in the Post&#8217;s stories.&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Dozens of former intelligence officials issued a stinging rebuke of Ratliffe on Monday night.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;Our experience makes us deeply suspicious that <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000175-4393-d7aa-af77-579f9b330000">the Russian government played a significant role in this case</a>,&#8221; a group of more than 50 former senior intelligence officials said in a letter published by Politico.&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;If we are right, this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this,&#8221; the letter continues.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>The experts include former CIA directors John Brennan, Michael Hayden, and Leon Panetta, and former DNI James Clapper. The list also includes former Trump officials such as Russ Travers, who served as National Counterterrorism Center acting director; Glenn Gerstell, the former NSA general counsel; Rick Ledgett, the former deputy NSA director; Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired CIA senior operations officer; and Cynthia Strand, who served as the CIA&#8217;s deputy assistant director for global issues.</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>The experts point out that they do not know if the emails provided by Giuliani to the Post are genuine or not, or if Russia was involved, but point out that the fallout from the story aligns perfectly with Moscow&#8217;s aims.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;Such an operation would be consistent with Russian objectives, as outlined publicly and recently by the Intelligence Community, to create political chaos in the United States and to deepen political divisions here but also to undermine the candidacy of former Vice President Biden and thereby help the candidacy of President Trump,&#8221; the letter reads.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Ratcliffe&#8217;s decision to publicly dismiss any Russian involvement is consistent with the Trump administration&#8217;s continued downplaying of the threat from Moscow ahead of the elections &#8212; despite repeated efforts by the intelligence community to warn that the risk remains high.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>On Tuesday morning, Trump told Fox News that Hunter Biden&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/meredithllee/status/1318523473682190336">has nothing to do with Russia</a>,&#8221; citing no evidence to back up the claim, but openly praising Ratcliffe&#8217;s decision to make his comments publicly.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Russia succeeded in 2016 because the U.S. was completely unprepared for the scale and sophistication of the disinformation campaigns Moscow was conducting. Four years on, the intelligence community and social networks are much more prepared to counter threats from abroad, but when the disinformation is coming from within, it is much more difficult to combat.</p>
</span><p></p><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Here&#8217;s what else is happening in the world of election disinformation.</p>
</span><h2 class="article__body-heading__heading heading2"><span><p>Facebook Suspends Account of Andrii Derkach, Who Helped Rudy Giuliani Dig Dirt On Biden&#160;</p>
</span></h2><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Facebook on Monday <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-suspends-account-ukrainian-politician-working-giuliani-n1243899">suspended the account of the Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach</a>, whom the U.S. government has been accused of being a Russian agent and trying to meddle in the presidential election.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>&#8220;We removed this account and this Page for violating our policy against the use of our platform by people engaged in election-focused influence operations,&#8221; Facebook said in a statement.</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Last month, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach for being &#8220;an active Russian agent for over a decade.&#8221; Giuliani has denied any knowledge that Derkach was a Russian agent, even though Trump was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/cia-other-spy-agencies-told-white-house-about-rudy-giuliani-n1243718">reportedly warned about Derkach&#8217;s links to Giuliani</a> last year.</p>
</span><h2 class="article__body-heading__heading heading2"><span><p>We Could Be About To Find Out Why Facebook and YouTube&#8217;s Algorithms Spread Disinformation</p>
</span></h2><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>The <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/">Citizen Browser Project</a> is an initiative designed &#8220;to measure how disinformation travels across social media platforms over time.&#8221; At the heart of this project is a new browser that aims to &#8220;audit the algorithms&#8221; social media platforms use to determine what information they show users. The project&#8217;s aim is to discover why Facebook and YouTube amplify one piece of content over another and why it recommends certain groups or accounts to follow. </p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>The data will come from a sample of 1,200 people who will install the specially-designed browser. Given that Facebook and YouTube have both struggled to reign in their algorithms from spreading disinformation, this project might give us some insight into what&#8217;s really happening. But as journalist and author Charles Arthur notes in his <a href="https://theoverspill.blog/2020/10/20/google-antitrust-search-imminent-start-up-1416/">Overspill newsletter</a>, &#8220;I wonder how long will it take for Facebook to run a browser detection tool and try to block this sort of auditing.&#8221;</p>
</span><h2 class="article__body-heading__heading heading2"><span><p>YouTube Banned QAnon, Then Livestreamed A Major QAnon Conference</p>
</span></h2><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>Q Con Live took place in Scottsdale Plaza Resort in Paradise Valley, Arizona on Saturday. It saw some of the biggest names in the Q universe gather to talk about all aspects of the baseless conspiracy theory. Among the topics of conversation among the attendees was the recent actions by social networks to ban their accounts and groups. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-suspends-account-ukrainian-politician-working-giuliani-n1243899">YouTube was one of the companies that took action against QAnon</a> in recent days.&#160;</p>
</span><span class="abc__textblock size--article"><p>But it turns out the ban was not working all that well, given that the entire Q Con Live conference was live-streamed on the platform &#8212; and at one point it was showing an ad from Senate Republicans over the video.</p>

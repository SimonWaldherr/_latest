Many speakers and market participants said they see a so-called blue wave solidifying, with little time left for President Donald Trump to shift momentum in his favor, the bank said in a recap note on Monday.</p><p>Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has enjoyed a consistent lead in what's shaping up to be "the most stable election in modern history," the bank said, leaving investors to position for a Democratic sweep.</p><p>All eyes are now on Senate races, as stimulus hinges on Congress' makeup. Markets expect frontloaded stimulus as a Biden administration works to pull the US economy out of its virus-induced downturn. The projection marks a stark shift from past months when investors viewed a split Congress as the best outcome. &#13;

More than 26 million votes had been cast as of Saturday, representing nearly a fifth of all votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. With 21 states able to start counting ballots early, results could arrive on or soon after Election Day on November 3 and allay fears of a significant delay.</p><p>Economists and lawmakers have repeatedly called for fresh stimulus ahead of the election, but the chance of such a deal is fading fast. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday imposed a 48-hour deadline for negotiations with the White House, seeking to fast-track the talks after three months of sluggish progress.</p><p>Even if the two groups reach a deal, Senate Republicans oppose a large bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated the body could vote on a $500 billion proposal as soon as Tuesday. But Senate Democrats are poised to block the measure, diminishing hopes for near-term fiscal support. &#13;

A split Congress under a Biden administration is now viewed as the worst outcome for the S&amp;P 500, as it would likely yield the same stimulus stalemate.</p><p>Investors should pay attention to Senate races in swing states and to chatter about a Biden Cabinet, as both would play critical roles in economic policy moving forward, the bank added.</p><p><strong>Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:</strong> &#13;

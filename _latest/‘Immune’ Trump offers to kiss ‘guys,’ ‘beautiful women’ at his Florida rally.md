President Trump said he was “immune” from the coronavirus at a campaign rally in Florida on Monday night — and offered to kiss everyone in the audience to prove his resilience.

Trump was about 20 minutes into his speech in front of thousands of supporters at an airport hanger in Sanford when he made the offer to kiss the audience members.

“I feel so powerful… I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women,” he said. “I’ll just give you a big fat kiss.”

Trump then continued riffing on his bounce back from his bout with COVID-19, saying he feels good after fighting off the virus.

“They say you’re immune. I don’t know for how long. Some people say for life, some people say for four months,” he said.

He also blasted Democrats for embracing state lockdowns as a measure to stop the spread of the virus.

“The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states,” he said.

Earlier in the rally, he said he would offer the treatment he received at Walter Reed Medical Center nationwide.

“We’re going to take whatever the hell they gave me and distribute it around to hospitals, everyone is going to have the same damn thing,” he said.

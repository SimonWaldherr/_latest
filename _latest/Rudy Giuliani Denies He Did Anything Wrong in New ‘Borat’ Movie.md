  Rudy Giuliani Denies He Did Anything Wrong in New ‘Borat’ Movie 
description: > 
  The excerpt from Mr. Cohen’s new “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,” which will be released on Friday, was posted on social media early Wednesday after The Guardian reported that the movie contained “a compromising scene” featuring Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor.Late Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani called into WABC radio in New York to say that he had been tucking in his shirt after removing microphone wires.He chalked the scene’s early release up to a scheme to discredit his recent attempts to push corruption accusations against Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son Hunter Biden.“The Borat video is a complete fabrication,” Mr. Giuliani, 76, tweeted after he got off the air.If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar.”

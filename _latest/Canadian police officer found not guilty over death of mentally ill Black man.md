<div><p>A Canadian police officer has been found not guilty over the death of a mentally ill Black man who was beaten during his arrest, in a case that became a flashpoint in the country&#8217;s fight against police brutality.</p>
<p>Daniel Montsion was acquitted on Tuesday of manslaughter over the 2016 death of Abdirahman Abdi. The verdict was immediately denounced as an indictment of Canada&#8217;s ability to deliver justice to marginalized groups.</p>
<p>The altercation between Abdi, 37, and the police began when officers were called to an Ottawa coffee shop over reports of a disturbance.</p>
<p>As the Canadian-Somali man fled to his apartment building, officers struck him with a baton and used pepper spray to subdue and arrest him.</p>
<p>Abdi was then left handcuffed and lying face-down in a pool of blood for nearly 10 minutes before paramedics arrived and began administering CPR. He later died in hospital.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/06/canada-police-officer-charged-death-black-man" class="u-underline">Following an investigation</a> by Ontario&#8217;s police watchdog, Montsion, 40, was charged with manslaughter, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, justice Robert Kelly said he had reasonable doubt about the use of force by officers &#8211; and whether the injuries sustained by Abdi contributed to his death.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end, my assessment of the evidence as a whole, under the governing principles of law, leaves me in a state of reasonable doubt,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The trial, which lasted more than 70 days and faced numerous delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic, focused on Montsion&#8217;s use of force.</p>

<p>Prosecutors acknowledged that Abdi wasn&#8217;t taking his prescribed medication and that his &#8220;assaultive&#8221; behaviour justified his arrest, but they argued he wasn&#8217;t dangerous or violent on the day of his death.</p>
<p>The Crown instead focused on Montsion&#8217;s knuckle-plated gloves, which they said were used as weapons. Justice Kelly acknowledged Montsion&#8217;s blows likely caused damage to Abdi&#8217;s face but remained unconvinced that the they were ultimately fatal.</p>
<p>The defence countered that it was Abdi&#8217;s underlying medical condition that killed him.</p>
<p>In addition to injuries to his face, Abdi also suffered a heart attack during the arrest. He died the following day in hospital of brain hypoxia, according to expert testimony in court.</p>
<p>The long-awaited verdict was delivered over a Zoom conference which quickly reached capacity &#8211; a testament to the intense scrutiny around the case.</p>
<p>News of Montsion&#8217;s acquittal was met with anger and resignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The family did not expect that the criminal justice system would be the way to resolve systemic problems including challenges in dealing with people who have mental health issues,&#8221; lawyer Lawrence Greenspon told reporters. &#8220;The family did not expect the criminal justice system would be the means to effecting change.&#8221;</p>

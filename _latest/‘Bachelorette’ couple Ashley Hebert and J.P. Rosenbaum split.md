“Bachelorette” couple J.P. Rosenbaum and Ashley Hebert have split.

Rosenbaum, 43, made the announcement first, via Instagram Wednesday night, writing in part that, “after months of separation, Ashley and I have amicably decided to live our lives apart from one another.”

“Please please please know that there is no one to blame, that there’s no event that triggered this decision, that no one is the victim, and that we’ve done absolutely everything we possibly can to try to salvage this marriage,” Rosenbaum’s post continued. “I think we’ve both come to realize that we are just two very different people, with very different personalities and perspectives, who just don’t see eye to eye on a lot [of] life fundamentals, those which are the building blocks for a happy and healthy marriage.”

“We request that you please respect our privacy as we move forward with the newness of our lives and attempt to create a new norm for our children,” he begins to wind down the lengthy announcement with. “Our ultimate focus is to co-parent our kids to the best of our ability and to maintain stable and healthy lives for Fordy & Essie.”

Hebert, 35, posted a shorter version of Rosenbaum’s statement — with all the germane points intact — to her own Instagram, using the same picture of the couple.

The couple met on Season 7 of “The Bachelorette” in 2011 and married in December 2012 in a ceremony that aired on ABC.

In December, Hebert revealed that Rosenbaum had been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the nerves.

<div><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319164198241341440?s=20">In a tweet posted early Thursday morning</a>, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said that prices for the Full Self-Driving (&#8220;FSD&#8221;) upgrade to Tesla vehicles would increase by roughly $2,000.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s potentially an indication that the company is realizing that it needs to find new ways to make up for the rapidly diverging cost of the company&#8217;s electric vehicle hardware and the suite of software and services that are the ingredients for much of the secret sauce that make Tesla&#8217;s vehicles so popular.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>

<p></p><p>To be clear, Tesla&#8217;s definition for fully self-driving cars is different from a fully autonomous vehicle. As TechCrunch reported last year when the company unveiled the plans for the latest version of its autonomous driving package, Musk described multiple levels of Tesla&#8217;s assessment of self-driving tech, and specified that this meant cars are &#8220;able to be autonomous but requiring supervision and intervention at times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1318678258339221505?s=20">announced in a tweet</a> that Tesla would be rolling out a beta version of its self-driving mode late Tuesday night, several hours before the company reported its third quarter earnings.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should.</p>

<p></p><p>The long-delayed deployment of more robust autonomous capabilities from Tesla comes nearly a year later than Musk had anticipated. It was on the company&#8217;s third quarter earnings call in 2019 that Musk first talked about the fully self-driving system. At the time, he&#8217;d said that the initial beta deployment could come as soon as the end of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it&#8217;s going to be tight, it still does appear that will be at least &#8230; in [an] early-access release of a feature complete self-driving feature this year,&#8221; Musk said at the time.</p>
<p>The FSD system, an upgrade from Tesla&#8217;s early experiments in autonomy that went under its Autopilot package, will cost an additional $10,000 after the price hike. The features will include &#8220;Summon&#8221; as well as &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/tesla-is-rolling-out-its-navigate-on-autopilot-feature/">Navigate on Autopilot</a>,&#8221; a system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes.</p>
<p>Tesla has been fine-tuning the Autopilot and broader FSD system through constant updates to the vehicle&#8217;s software via over-the-air transmissions and the company said that the nav system should soon respond to traffic lights, stop signs and other traffic inputs when driving on city streets.</p>

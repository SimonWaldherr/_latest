  Police will not fine people over 'confusing' new Covid-19 rules 
description: > 
  Andy Rhodes, chief constable of Lancashire, a Tier 3 area, said: "We should not [be] fining people for being confused about whether they can have two people in the house or not.He said the force was targeting its officers at high-rate Covid-19 areas and flagrant law breakers within those areas, such as a wake attended by 150 people the weekend before Lancashire went into Tier 3 status.“Handing out more fines to people who are genuinely confused is just going to alienate the public, who are already tired of Covid and tired of being told what to do,” said another senior policing source.“But the officers have to take on face value, if they say they 'we were confused' because there is so much confusion out there.In terms of having a regime that is enforceable, it is not.”

<div><p>Andy Rhodes, chief constable of Lancashire, a Tier 3 area, said: "We should not [be] fining people for being confused about whether they can <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/21/rule-6-covid-19-social-distancing-rules/">have two people in the house or not</a>. We are focused on clear breaches."</p>
<p>He said the force was targeting its officers at high-rate Covid-19 areas and flagrant law breakers within those areas, such as a wake attended by 150 people the weekend before Lancashire went into Tier 3 status.</p>
<p>&#8220;Handing out more fines to people who are genuinely confused is just going to alienate the public, who are already tired of Covid and tired of being told what to do,&#8221; said another senior policing source.</p>
<p>"There is also a danger, especially in the North of England, that the police are seen as doing the bidding of the Westminster elite, and it is never good when the public begin to see the police as agents of the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>A senior policing source in the north of England added: "There has been some lip service paid to enforcement, with officers visiting licensed premises to check if people are members of the same household.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the officers have to take on face value, if they say they 'we were confused' because <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/01/confusion-inconsistency-world-reporting-uk-governments-response/">there is so much confusion out there</a>. In terms of having a regime that is enforceable, it is not.&#8221;</p>

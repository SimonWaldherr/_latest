<div><p>The manager of the Trump&#160;campaign wrote to the CPD on Monday to object to the topics, which were chosen by Ms Welker, claiming that the selection failed to honour a "long-standing custom" of debating foreign policy. Mr&#160;Stepien also claimed that the Trump and Biden campaigns agreed to foreign affairs being a key part of the third debate.</p>
<p>Mr Stepien said: "As is the long-standing custom, and as has been promised by the Commission on Presidential Debates, we had expected that foreign policy would be the central focus of the October 22 debate.</p>
<p>"We urge you to recalibrate the topics and return to subjects which had already been confirmed."</p>
<p>Mr Stepien claimed that the decision showed the CPD was biased in favour of Mr Biden, who he said was&#160;&#8220;desperate to avoid conversations about his own foreign policy record&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission&#8217;s pro-Biden antics have turned the entire debate season into a fiasco and it is little wonder why the public has lost faith in its objectivity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The CPD insisted that it has tried to "strike the right balance".</p>
<p>"We realise, after discussions with both campaigns, that neither campaign may be totally satisfied with the measures announced today," the commission said in a statement.</p>
<p>"We are comfortable that these actions strike the right balance and that they are in the interest of the American people, for whom these debates are held."</p>

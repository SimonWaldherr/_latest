<div><p>With the Notre Dame Football team&#8217;s first game since the passing of ESPN NFL reporter Vaughn McClure, there was a tribute for the team&#8217;s former reporter in the press box.</p>
<p>McClure, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/espn-falcons-reporter-vaughn-mcclure-dead-at-48/">who passed away earlier this week</a> at his Atlanta apartment at the age of 48, used to cover Notre Dame football for the South Bend Tribune and the Tribune&#8217;s Irish Sports Report magazine from 1999 to 2004 and later for the Chicago Sun-Times. He was honored during the Fighting Irish&#8217;s 12-7 win over Louisville Saturday with an honorary spot in the press box and a photo, as shared by Tim O&#8217;Malley of Irish Illustrated.</p>
<p>Eric Hansen, the Tribune&#8217;s assistant sports editor and columnist and the magazine&#8217;s former managing editor, had<a href="https://www.southbendtribune.com/sports/former-south-bend-tribune-sports-writer-and-espn-reporter-vaughn-mcclure-dies-at-48/article_acb6ac26-0f37-11eb-bac6-e7930e443c1a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> some touching words about McClure</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;To try to sum up Vaughn McClure&#8217;s impact in a couple of paragraphs is like trying to pour the Pacific Ocean into thimble,&#8221; Hansen said. &#8220;When we hired him in 1999, his goal &#8212; his obsession, really &#8212; was being better at his craft than the day before. And I&#8217;ve never seen someone grow as fast and as dramatically in our business as Vaughn, which isn&#8217;t even the most impressive thing about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was? It&#8217;s who he was at his core, a man who wanted to make a difference in the world. Through his writing. Through some very frank late-night talks about life in America. Through his hugs. Through his disarming smile. He didn&#8217;t just crush his mission of getting better. He made all of us, who came in contact with him, better people along the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most recently covering the Atlanta Falcons, McClure had worked at ESPN since 2013 after six years covering the Bears at the Chicago Tribune. McClure, a Chicago native, also worked at the Fresno Bee and DeKalb Daily Chronicle after graduating from Northern Illinois University in 1994.</p>

The last time the Lakers hoisted the Larry O’Brien Trophy, Kobe Bryant was at the center of the celebration. Ten years later, the Lakers legend is still a poignant figure in the team’s latest title after he died in January, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others.

Following Sunday’s 106-93 win over the Miami Heat, Bryant’s widow Vanessa marked the championship-clinching victory on Instagram, posting a photo of Bryant and Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka, who was Bryant’s agent and friend.

“Kobe was right RP! ‘Stay the course — blockout the noise,’”Vanessa wrote on the Instagram story, quoting her late husband.

“Wish Kobe and Gigi were here to see this,” she added with a cared heart emoji.

Pelinka, who was also Gianna’s godfather, recalled other lessons from Bryant after the victory during an interview. Despite the Lakers’ long title drought, Bryant was positive that the team would return to the top again soon.

“Guess you were right, man,” Pelinka told reporters while looking upward. “You gave me the energy to do it.”

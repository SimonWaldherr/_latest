  Giuliani - who has been trying to push a spurious Hunter Biden conspiracy with the aid of The New York Post in recent days and who was singled out by Russian spies as a gullible point of access to Trump - denied that he had been pranked by Baron Cohen, saying he had reported the matter to the police when it took place in July and claimed the suggestion that he was touching himself was “a complete fabrication”.

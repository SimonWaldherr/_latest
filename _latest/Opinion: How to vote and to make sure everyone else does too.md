(CNN) As behavioral scientists who study how to increase election turnout, we have become quite accustomed to receiving this desperate message from friends and colleagues: "I don't live in a battleground state. How can I increase turnout?" They badly want to participate in the election, but because their vote may have little influence in determining the outcomes in their home states, they want to help drive turnout where it will make the most difference.

They ask our advice not just because of our experience in politics, but because they know our advice is based on hundreds of randomized controlled experiments that we and others have conducted measuring what actually increases turnout during elections.

The only systematic difference between the groups is our experimental encouragement to vote (e.g., a door knock). Thus, when we see a difference in turnout between the treatment and control groups, we know that the cause is the specific tactic being studied. This allows us to estimate the effectiveness of individual tactics, like door knocks leaflets and emails

The voting process is much more complicated in the US than other countries, and more complicated this election than in the past. In most states, voters must first register to vote by a certain deadline . They then have an opportunity to apply to vote by mail — a method of voting expected to be used more than ever before this November. If the application is accepted, voters receive a vote by mail form and must complete, seal, sign and mail it by a certain deadline according to each state's rules. If they do not decide to vote by mail, they can vote in person at a polling place on Election Day — or even a few days or weeks before, depending on state rules.

This complicated process means there are several stages where even motivated citizens can be derailed. For people who are motivated to get others to the polls, especially in battleground states, here are five ways you can help increase turnout:

							Fire up those Gaudreau trade rumors again (Jeff McIntosh/CP)						
													 

				
<p>The Calgary Flames want to get better, but with just about $4 million in cap space, they are likely going to need to trade a key roster piece to do so. After signing Andrew Mangiapane on Friday, Flames <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nhl/article/will-flames-still-consider-altering-core-early-off-season-moves/">GM Brad Treliving said</a>, &#8220;We don&#8217;t expect this is the team we&#8217;ll go to training camp with.&#8221;</p>



<p>This team needs to get better too. They were <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/dal-vs-cgy/2020/08/20/2019030176#game=2019030176,game_state=final">eliminated</a> in spectacular fashion in these past playoffs. With their backs against the wall, the Flames took a three goal lead before surrendering 7 unanswered goals to the Stars dropping their series in six games.</p><p id="dsk-box-ad-c"></p>&#13;
<p id="mob-box-ad-a"></p><p>One player in particular seems to be the poster child for the Flames inability to win in the postseason is Johnny Gaudreau. That seems pretty unfair for a guy who scored 7 points in 10 games in the playoffs (including the qualifying round).</p>



<h2 id="h-calgary-flames-rumors-with-gaudreau-go-back-to-last-november">Calgary Flames rumors with Gaudreau go back to last November</h2>



<p>Johnny Gaudreau of the Calgary Flames has been in the NHL trade rumor mill a few times this season. The speculation started in&#160;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theathletic.com/1385118/2019/11/18/is-it-time-for-the-flames-to-consider-trading-johnny-gaudreau/" target="_blank">The Athletic</a>&#160;back in November but died down. Those rumors picked up at the deadline and went off the charts when Gaudreau temporarily took the Flames out of his Twitter bio.</p>



<p>The Flames left winger turned 27 this past August. He had a decent year with 58 points in 70 games, but a far cry from last year&#8217;s 99 point campaign. Surely that can&#8217;t be the reason why you would trade a player entering his prime years.</p>

<p>For the Flames it all comes down to money and the cap. Calgary operated with just under $1 million in space before the pause. Add on the fact the cap will remain flat at $81.5M for the next two seasons, and the Flames need to find some room if they want to improve more than already have. Jacob Markstrom was certainly a really good start.</p>

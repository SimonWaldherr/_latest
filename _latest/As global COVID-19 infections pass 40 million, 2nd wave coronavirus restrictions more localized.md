<div><p>New York &#8212; After entire nations were shut down during the first surge of the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> earlier this year, some countries and U.S. states are trying more targeted measures as cases rise again around the world, especially <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-united-states-69000-new-cases-most-single-day-since-july/" target="_blank">in the United States</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-europe-second-wave-lockdowns/" target="_blank">Europe</a> and Latin America. Data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University showed that, as of Monday, more than 40 million people had contracted the virus since the disease was first detected in Wuhan, China, late last year. The global death toll stood Monday at more than 1.1 million.</p>

<p>While countries including&#160;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-israel-nationwide-lockdown-reaction/" target="_blank">Israel</a>&#160;and the Czech Republic have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/europe-covid-cases-rise-spain-france-uk-tighten-coronavirus-restrictions/" target="_blank">reinstated nationwide closures</a>, other governments hope smaller-scale shutdowns can work this time, in conjunction with testing, contact tracing and other initiatives they've now built up.</p><p>The concept of containing hot spots isn't new, but it's being tested under new pressures as authorities try to avoid a dreaded resurgence of illness and deaths, this time with economies weakened from earlier lockdowns, populations chafing at the idea of renewed restrictions and some communities complaining of unequal treatment.</p><p>Some scientists say a localized approach, if well-tailored and explained to the public, can be a nimble response at a complex point in the pandemic.</p> 
<p>"It is pragmatic in appreciation of 'restriction fatigue' ... but it is strategic, allowing for mobilization of substantial resources to where they are needed most," says Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, who is following New York City's efforts closely and is on some city advisory boards.</p><p>Other scientists are warier.</p><p>"If we're serious about wiping out COVID in an area, we need coordinated responses across" as wide a swath as possible, says Benjamin Althouse, a research scientist with the Institute for Disease Modeling in Washington state.</p><p>In a study that has been posted online but not published in a journal or reviewed by independent experts, Althouse and other scientists found that amid patchwork coronavirus-control measures in the U.S. this spring, some people traveled farther than usual for such activities as worship, suggesting they might have responded to closures by hopscotching to less-restricted areas.</p>

    </p>
<p>Still, choosing between limited closures and widespread restrictions is "a very, very difficult decision," Althouse notes. "I'm glad I'm not the one making it."</p><p>Early in the outbreak, countries tried to quell hot spots from Wuhan, China &#8212; where a stringent lockdown was seen as key in squelching transmission in the world's most populous nation &#8212; to Italy, where a decision to seal off 10 towns in the northern region of Lombardy evolved within weeks into a nationwide lockdown.</p><p>After the virus's first surge, officials fought flare-ups with city-sized closures in recent months in places from Barcelona, Spain, to Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>In the English city of Leicester, nonessential shops were shut down and households banned from mixing in late June. The infection rate fell, dropping from 135 cases per 100,000 to around 25 cases per 100,000 in about two months.</p><p>Proponents took that as evidence localized lockdowns work. Skeptics argued that summertime transmission rates were generally low anyway in the United Kingdom, where the official coronavirus death toll of over 43,000 stands as Europe's highest, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>With infection levels and deaths rising anew in Britain, scientists advised officials to implement a national, two-week lockdown.

<p>The 72-year-old business, Bencraft Hatters, is in one of a handful of small areas around the state with new restrictions. Authorities hope they'll avert a wider crisis in a state that beat back the deadliest spike in the U.S. this spring, losing over 33,000 people to date.</p><p>Goldstein takes the virus seriously &#8212; he said he and his mother both had it early on &#8212; and he sees the economic rationale behind trying local restrictions instead of another citywide or statewide shutdown.</p><p>But he questions whether the zones are capturing all the trouble spots, and he's rankled that the restrictions are falling on his shop after, he says, he faithfully enforced mask-wearing and other rules.</p><p>"I did my part, and a lot of other people did our part, and yet we're being forced to close," said Goldstein, 53, who tapped into savings to sustain the third-generation business through the earlier shutdown.</p></div>

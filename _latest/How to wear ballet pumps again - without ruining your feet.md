There’s something to be said for shoes you can dance in. Even though there’s not a lot to celebrate right now… Ease and simplicity are the only fashion trends worth paying attention to in 2020, and so it’s no surprise to see the slip-on-and-go ballet pump experiencing a revival. Women in the public eye, from US Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio Cortez (AOC) to Angelina Jolie and Kate Moss are rediscovering the elegant slipper-style. Much like my beloved Birkenstocks, the ballerina flat is perfect for indoors and out, and possibly a better way to add effortless chic to the supermarket dash.

But tread carefully. It’s all very well wanting to look like And God Created Woman- era Brigitte Bardot in her iconic Repetto pumps, but over a decade ago, I found to my cost that extreme flatness can make your feet hurt. Running around town in a much-loved pair of orange leather ballerinas for days on end had me jetéd straight into orthotics misery. Is it possible then to wear ballet pumps this time round without completely destroying my feet?

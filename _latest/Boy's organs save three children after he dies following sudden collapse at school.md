 <p>     </p> <p>The dad confirmed via England Rugby three children had benefited from the donation of Patryk's organs.</p> <p>He said: "Patryk will always be our super hero, his organs have already given three children the gift of life.</p> <p>"The grief will always be with us, it&#8217;s like an ocean at the moment.</p> <p>"We are in a storm in the Atlantic whereas my mum and dad are in the Mediterranean; always there but the waves not so big.&#8221;</p> <p>Offley Primary Academy pupil Patryck was a well-known figure in the Sandbach community and a popular member of Sandbach Rugby Club's under-8s side.</p> <p>Patryk was described as a "sporty, beautiful and healthy boy" who not only loved rugby but also rollerblading, golf, karate and swimming.</p>

   <p>Rob Mayor, former chairman of Sandbach RUFC and close friend of the Milner family, said: "Patryk always had a smile on his face, a cheeky little lad who knew everyone's name and everyone knew his.</p> <p>&#8220;He was a live-wire. His favourite drink was Vimto which he somehow made you buy from him and then proceeded to drink it himself.</p> <p>"Not too much later, he would be seen playing the same trick on someone else.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>"Saturday and Sunday were Patryk&#8217;s favourite days down the club, and he would frequently ride his scooter around the clubhouse and ask the senior players to play with him.</p> <p>"His favourite team was Sale Sharks and he loved interacting with ex-Sandbach RUFC player Will Cliff, who visited the club regularly.</p> <p>"He will be dearly missed by all."</p></div>

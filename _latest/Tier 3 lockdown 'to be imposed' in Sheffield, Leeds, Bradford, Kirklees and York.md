 <p>     </p> <p>Council leaders in West Yorkshire said on Friday that moving to Tier 3 had not formed part of their discussion with the government - giving some hope the area might avoid tighter restrictions.</p> <p>But Huddersfield MP&#160;Barry Sheerman&#160;said he is not "optimistic" Kirklees&#160;can avoid heading into Tier 3 and even went as far to say: "I still think it's inevitable that we have a circuit breaker over the half-term."</p> <p>In North Yorkshire meanwhile, York MP Racheal Maskell told the House of Commons late last week that she believes a Tier 3 lockdown might actually be beneficial for her city, even though it only entered Tier 2 on Saturday.</p> <p>She said: "I do not believe the measures in Tier 2 are going to be sufficient to stop the spread of the virus in our city which is rising incredibly sharply and in the older population as well."</p>

   <h3>What is happening today?</h3> <p>Kirklees Council leaders are holding a crunch meeting today to discuss the likelihood of a Tier 3 lockdown for the likes of Huddersfield, Dewsbury and Holmfirth.</p> <p>Although West Yorkshire leaders said on Friday that Tier 3 had not yet been discussed with No 10 officials, more serious discussions are due to get underway early this week.</p> <p>In a joint statement, they said: "The government have asked us to meet them again.</p> <p>"We see this as an opportunity to set out the effectiveness of local measures, what further resources are needed to support local teams and businesses, and to review the latest health data.</p> <p>"We expect the government to engage in open, constructive discussions about how to tackle the virus without doing further damage to the economy, jobs and livelihoods."</p>

   <h3>How quickly could new regions go into Tier 3?</h3> <p>Although the government's new three-thier system only came into effect last Wednesday, a number of subsequent announcements have shown just how quickly things can change.</p> <p>By Saturday, London, Essex, York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash (Derbyshire), Elmbridge (Surrey), and Barrow in Furness (Cumbria) had all been upgraded to Tier 2. This happened just three days after they were initially told were placed into Tier 1.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>For the biggest indication of what could be coming for the likes of Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford and Kirklees, it would be wise to glance across the Pennines.</p> <p>While Greater Manchester has not yet been placed into Tier 3, talks have been ongoing since Thursday and although there is still a deadlock between local leaders and central government, many suggest it is just a matter of time before they follow their North West neighbours Liverpool into the strictest coronavirus measures.</p></div>

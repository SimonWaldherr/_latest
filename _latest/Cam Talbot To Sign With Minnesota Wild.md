The Minnesota Wild are expected to sign Cam Talbot according to Frank Seravalli of TSN. Pierre LeBrun of The Athletic tweets that the contract will be a three-year deal worth a total of $11MM.

While we projected Talbot to land in Minnesota, it wasn’t for nearly as much as the Wild have committed in this deal. The team must obviously feel he can carry the majority of the load for the next few seasons, despite struggling in his last opportunity as a starting goaltender.

In 2017-18 when Talbot was the Oilers full-time starter, leading the league with 67 appearances, he registered a .908 save percentage and lost a league-leading 31 games. It went even further downhill the next year when he had an .893 save percentage with the Oilers before a late-season trade to Philadelphia. While Talbot rebounded this season with the Calgary Flames, he also wasn’t asked to play every game.

Minnesota still have Alex Stalock in the mix for the backup role, while top prospect Kaapo Kahkonen is still in the system. Kahkonen took home the AHL Goaltender of the Year award this season and should eventually push his way onto the NHL roster.

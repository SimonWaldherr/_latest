Breaking up was hard to do, but at least Prince William didn’t split with Kate Middleton in a text. He chose a phone call instead.

The royal couple is happily married now, but the two went through a rocky patch four years before they tied the knot in 2011, described by author Robert Lacey in his new book titled “Battle of the Brothers,” excerpted in the Daily Mail.

Here’s how the brief 2007 separation went down:

William called Kate on April 11, 2007, while she was working on the job as an accessories buyer for the luxe women’s clothing store Jigsaw.

Lacey claims William, then 25, was “uncertain” about his future with Kate.

“Kate excused herself from a meeting … to take a call from William in a room out of earshot of the other buyers, Lacey wrote.

“She shut the door for more than an hour. When she came out, she was single.”

The breakup lasted only a couple of months — and both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge talked publicly about it during their engagement interview in 2010.

“We were sort of both finding ourselves as such and being different characters and stuff, it was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up,” William said.

And Middleton admitted she wasn’t happy about the split but that it made her stronger.

“You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn’t realized, or I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you are younger and I really valued that time for me as well, although I didn’t think it at the time.”

<div><p>Barack Obama unleashed a fierce attack on Donald Trump during his first in-person appearance on the campaign trail, mocking the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/13/lowering-tone-overdue-overhaul-trumps-tweets-have-torn-centuries/">US president's tweeting</a> of conspiracy theories, and dismissing his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The former president used a speech in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to repeatedly hammer his successor&#8217;s record in office with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/21/2020-election-us-date-when-what-swing-states-how-work-covid/">less than two weeks left before election day</a> in America.</p>
<p>Many of Mr Obama&#8217;s critiques, delivered at a drive-in rally in front of 300 cars, centred on Mr Trump&#8217;s approach to coronavirus, the issue the Democrats are putting at the centre of their campaign to elect Joe Biden.&#160; Many beeped their horns in approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald Trump isn't suddenly going to protect all of us. He can't even take the basic steps to protect himself,&#8221; Mr Obama said.</p>
<p>He added that his own administration &#8220;literally left the White House a pandemic play book&#8221; but &#8220;they probably used it to, I don't know, prop up a wobbly table somewhere."</p>

Manual claims reviews typically require a lot of back and forth between drivers and claims adjusters, which takes <a href="https://e.businessinsider.com/click/21854473.4/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3Zlci5jb20vYmxvZy9ob3ctbG9uZy1kb2VzLWZpbGluZy1hbi1hdXRvLWluc3VyYW5jZS1jbGFpbS10YWtlLw/5d233c18f730436f2414784fBec6c274a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>&#160;and can lead to errors due to poor communication.</p><p>In addition, insurers must screen for fraudulent claims, such as people exaggerating their car accident injuries, which adds up to&#160;<a href="https://e.businessinsider.com/click/21854473.4/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9uZWJyaWRnZWJwLmNvbS9saWJyYXJ5L3VuY2F0ZWdvcml6ZWQvdGhlLXJlYWwtY29zdC1vZi1pbnN1cmFuY2UtZnJhdWQv/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB50b53201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$18 billion</a> to US drivers' annual insurance bill and further slows the process. Previously, Clearcover claims took a couple of days, at least, to be paid. By contrast, the machine learning algorithm automatically processes policy history along with First Notice of Loss (FNOL) information in minutes.</p><p>It can also flag suspicious claims, allowing the insurer to focus its investigators on specific cases. This reduces operational costs, and the savings can then be passed on to the customer, enhancing satisfaction. Other auto insurtechs still take days to process claims&#8212;such as <a href="https://e.businessinsider.com/click/21854473.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam9pbnJvb3QuY29tL2NsYWltcy8/5d233c18f730436f2414784fBd354502b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Root </a>and <a href="https://e.businessinsider.com/click/21854473.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWV0cm9taWxlLmNvbS9jbGFpbXMv/5d233c18f730436f2414784fBebadf081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metromile</a>, which require users to go through human experts&#8212;making Clearcover stand out.</p><p>Clearcover should now chase licensing to reduce reliance on partners and drive revenue gains.

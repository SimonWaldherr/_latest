Times are desperate when you are on J.R. Smith’s Instagram Live looking to be rescued.

That was the situation Lakers backup guard Quinn Cook found himself in Sunday night, though. As Smith and Lakers teammates celebrated their NBA title on the bus out of the arena, Cook was left behind.

“Gotta walk back after I win a f–king ring. WTF,” Cook commented on Smith’s Instagram Live video after the Lakers’ 106-93 Game 6 win over the Heat clinched the title.

WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE

Smith relayed the information back to Dion Waiters (“Cheese”), who did not sound too sympathetic to Cook’s situation. Cook, who grew up a Lakers fan, continued his pleas for help.

“Come backkkk.”

“UTurn.”

“Wow cheese.”

Following Cook’s own Instagram stories, he eventually reunited with his Lakers teammates and celebrated the team’s accomplishment inside the NBA bubble.

Cook played sparingly in the postseason, though did appear in 44 games throughout the regular season.

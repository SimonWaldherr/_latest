<div><p>But Maschler&#8217;s high-octane buccaneering style made him a controversial figure in the industry and he was sometimes criticised for having little interest in books for their own sake. &#8220;He&#8217;s not the man to go to for a third re-reading of Don Quixote,&#8221; as one observer remarked. Yet his instinct for what would sell and his flair for promotion were unrivalled. At book fairs buyers would take whatever he had because they knew that it would sell.</p>
<p>Ironically, though, Maschler only ended up in publishing after having done all he could to avoid it.</p>
<p>Thomas Michael Maschler was born in Berlin on August 16 1933. His father, Kurt, was a Left-wing Jewish book salesman who had gone on to buy two publishing houses. In 1938, just before the Anschluss, the family moved to Vienna where, one evening, the Nazis arrived to arrest Kurt Maschler. Fortunately he was away on a trip, but they confiscated the house, along with his collection of first editions and correspondence from, among others, Cezanne, Van Gogh, Thomas Mann and Herman Hesse.</p>
<p>Tom and his mother Rita immediately left Austria for America but, after failing to get a passage from Sweden, they travelled to Britain, where they were later joined by Kurt. Rita took a job as a housekeeper in a grand house in Berkshire while Kurt, always travelling on business, only visited on rare weekends.</p>
<p>Tom attended the local state primary school and then went on to Leighton Park, a Quaker school near Reading. For two years he stayed with six different families because his parents could not afford the boarding fees. His childhood experiences toughened him, and his toughness would prove to be both a blessing and curse.</p>
<p>During his time at school, where he was a champion tennis, squash and fives player, he travelled in Europe most summers and spent little time with his parents. It came as little surprise to him when they separated.</p>

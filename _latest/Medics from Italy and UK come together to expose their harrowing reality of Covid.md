It was like an apocalypse, like an iceberg spreading. At one time, ventilated patients reached almost 300.</p> <p>&#8220;It was like an earthquake where after the event you see many patients hurt. Except that every day you see more patients than the day before.&#8221;</p>

 <p>     </p> <p> On the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/europe-talks">videocall</a>, two pairs of eyes reveal the trauma they went through. </p> <p>Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, Greater London, where 30-year-old Dr Sahota was working as a junior doctor, would become the hardest hit hospital in the UK just weeks later.</p> <p>&#8220;We were very badly affected too, having to transfer patients to different ICUs because we were so full,&#8221; Dr Sahota says.&#8221;I found ICU so stressful, patients on ventilator, the alarms going off. It was very upsetting. I only qualified a year and a half ago.&#8221;</p> <p>We asked the two medics to meet via a videocall, to pioneer our new project Europe Talks &#8211; a version of our ground-breaking Britain Talks series.</p> <p> As Britain approaches the final cliff edge of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a>, the Daily Mirror has teamed up with newspapers and websites in Italy, Germany, France, Poland and 10 other European countries to pair people for a chat across national boundaries. </p>

 <p>     </p> <p>Using a system developed by Zeit Online in Germany, readers will be matched to someone in another country to talk about how our different lives have been affected by the coronavirus, and to see whether we can find &#8216;more in common&#8217; internationally.</p> <p>The sign up for Europe Talks, which will take place on Dec 13, starts today.</p> <p>For our two doctors, the conversation leads to some deeply personal reflections on fear, professionalism and family. Both shielded their families from the virus.</p> <p>&#8220;It was hard,&#8221; Dr Cosentini says. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t meet my sons in person for three months. They are 24 and 25 and live with their mother, and we had a chat every night when I got home late.</p> <p>"We were a strong family, that helped me cope with the struggle of the unknown and with looking after very sick people.&#8221;</p>

 <p>     </p> <p>Dr Sahota nods. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t afraid for myself, but at the beginning I was staying with my parents. I knew they wouldn't necessarily be considered fit for a ventilator in my hospital, so I was very afraid of infecting them.</p> <p>"I moved out because I worried I could picking the disease up at work. I felt contaminated, this psychology of feeling dirty.&#8221;</p> <p>Both doctors were working in surgery when coronavirus hit, changing jobs to Intensive Care to fight the pandemic, and both talk about the solidarity they felt with colleagues during the first wave.</p> <p>&#8220;Every one of us worked double shifts, even though nobody asked us to do this,&#8221; Dr Cosentini says.</p> <p>&#8220;We always thanked each other for our work. This helped us very much, because we felt a very strong group. If the group is strong it is difficult to be overwhelmed completely.&#8221;</p>

 <p>Dr Sahota smiles. &#8220;There were one or two doctors who would just say thank you to everyone in the hospital &#8211; doctors, cleaners, kitchen staff,&#8221; she says.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a small thing to do, but it can really transform morale. It was strangely emotional. I would get a weird urge to blurt out &#8216;I love you&#8217; at the end of professional phone calls. Emotions were obviously running high.</p> <p>&#8220;As it went on for longer and longer, our rota became crazy, all the shifts were night shifts, they were all 12-hours, we were always tired, lonely and always isolated, and it became a very intense bonding experience. Everyone was trying to prop each other up, that was the best part.&#8221;</p> <p>Dr Cosentini says that he and his colleagues made a conscious effort to warn Britain and other countries about what was coming because he knew Italians had not &#8220;believed enough&#8221; in what was happening to China before them.</p> 



<p class="spacer"></p>

 <p>Even so, Dr Sahota admits she was still not taking it fully seriously.</p> <p>&#8220;I remember at the end of February, when we were a month behind you, I was still going to crowded house parties and even joking about Coronavirus,&#8221; she says, regretfully.</p> <p>&#8220;One of the big things it has taught me, until something really is right in front of you, you don&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p> <p>Dr Sahota and her colleagues had reason to be grateful to their Italian colleagues during the first wave, not just for their warnings.</p> 



<p class="spacer"></p>
<img alt="The two doctors chatted over a video call">

 

 <p>&#8220;Around the end of March, we were shown all these videos of ICUs in Italy,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It showed us the techniques that really worked.&#8221;</p> <p>But while PPE shortages endangered staff in the UK, in Bergamo, Dr Cosentini&#8217;s hospital never ran out. This meant the infection rate was much lower for medics there.</p> <p>&#8220;I was afraid in the first few days, when I realised I&#8217;d had close contact with the first two patients,&#8221; he says.</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if we just got used to fear, but also because we never ran out of PPE and we always had the right equipment, we had very low rate of infection.</p> 



<p class="spacer"></p>
<img alt="Europe Talks will see people from a raft of countries share their experiences">

 

 <p>"Most colleagues who did contract Covid caught it in the community, before we knew the virus was already with us.&#8221;</p> <p>Now, still traumatised from the first wave, both doctors must prepare to confront the second.</p> <p>&#8220;It is mounting in Milan, where I live,&#8221; Dr Cosentini says.</p> <p>&#8220;We are worried because we already had this tough experience. We are more prepared, we have a clear plan, what we did during the first wave was right and we want to do it again. But our resistance, our strength, our batteries are not full now.&#8221;</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>Dr Sahota agrees. &#8220;I have this dread. I hope it doesn&#8217;t come back. I personally don&#8217;t think I can do this again, I felt broken at the end. But you don&#8217;t get to choose when you are ready for the second wave.&#8221;</p> <p>Dr Cosentini contrasts the way different countries have approached the virus politically with the way doctors have worked in solidarity across borders.</p> <p>&#8220;This was a worldwide pandemic,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We continually exchanged information, news, hypotheses and ideas amongst the emergency doctors all across the world. I felt not only Italian, but a citizen of the world.&#8221;</p> <p>In the next weeks, both doctors will face the second wave together, 750 miles, four countries and three decades apart.</p> <h3>How to join</h3> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

Our special widget will also be appearing in coronavirus coverage and other stories for the next few weeks. </p> <p>A series of controversial yes or no questions being discussed across Europe will then help us learn a bit more about you. For example: what is more important, our health or the economy? And should masks be required in all public spaces?</p> <p>Once you have answered the seven questions and registered, you will then be matched by the Europe Talks algorithm with another European who has a different view of these seven questions.</p> <p>Meeting up will happen by videocall on Sunday December 13. You will need to be free for a chat at 2pm UK time on that day.</p> <p>As so many participants will have different first languages, Europe Talks organisers have suggested these video calls should take place in English if possible.</p></div>

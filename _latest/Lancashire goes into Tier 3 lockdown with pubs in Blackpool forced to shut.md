Lancashire will become the second region of England to go into a harsh 'Tier 3' local lockdown from midnight tonight.

In a massive blow to locals and Blackpool's battered tourism industry, it's expected pubs and bars will be forced to shut in the county unless they can operate as a restaurant.

Such pubs must serve "substantial" meals and people will only be allowed to order alcohol if it comes with a meal.

Indoor gatherings will also be banned, meetings in private gardens or beer gardens are banned, and residents will be advised against non-essential travel in or out of the area.

It is the second region to join the Tier 3 "very high" alert after the Liverpool City Region - meaning 3million people in England are now under the harshest tier.

A deal was done this morning to move the whole county - including Blackpool - into the highest tier after days of talks. Local leaders said there will be £42m of support, up from £12m originally offered by government.

But amid a huge row over the 67% wage support for workers, Blackpool Council leader Lynn Williams told the Mirror: "We are reluctantly agreed. We were kind of bullied into this."

Under Tier 3 rules, people can still meet in groups of up to six in the park, beach or open country.

People should try to avoid travelling outside the very-high alert level or entering a very-high alert level area, other than for work, education or for caring responsibilities or to travel through as part of a longer journey

Residents should avoid staying overnight in another part of the UK, and others should avoid staying overnight in the Very High Alert area.

On top of normal Tier 3 rules, car boot sales, adult gaming, casinos, bingo halls, betting shops and soft play areas must all close by law in Lancashire from Monday onwards.

But gyms and leisure centres in Lancashire will stay open, unlike in Liverpool City Region where they shut.

The new restrictions cover Burnley, Blackburn with Darwen, Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Hyndburn, Lancaster, Pendle, Preston, Ribble Valley, Rossendale, South Ribble, West Lancashire, Wyre.

Blackpool Council leader Ms Williams said the furlough scheme paying 67% of wages was “not enough” with many across Lancashire already on minimum wage.

But she added: “Essentially we had to agree to this deal or we would not have got a share of anything. And we were also at risk of more businesses going into the closed list.

“But we will be working with the government in terms of how the money will be delivered to businesses, to ensure that money goes to the businesses that are most affected in Blackpool and across Lancashire.”

She added: “Obviously we have a different economy. Lancashire is very varied and Blackpool stands out by itself. Our economy is going to be incredibly affected and we wanted more support for our businesses.”

Speaking to the BBC, the Tory leader of Lancashire County Council Geoff Driver said: "Like other areas, it means pubs and bars will have to close, but we've managed to get an acceptance that we've got significant measures in places to monitor gyms and leisure service so they won't be closing.

"We will be getting additional help for test and tracing.

"And in addition to the £12million we were offered by the government we've secured £30 million to support the businesses affected by this change."

He added: "This is a serious serious matter and we've got to get the message across that this isn't over."

He said the council would use the £30million to "top up where needed" the support for businesses and individuals in hardship because of the changes.

Asked if it was enough money he said "time will tell" as he confirmed that council chiefs had asked for £50million before being negotiated down to £42million.

Talks are still ongoing with leaders in Greater Manchester who have refused to enter Tier 3 without greater government support.

Meanwhile the BBC reported councils in Northumberland, Tyneside, Wearside and County Durham were given a week’s reprieve before a Tier 3 move would be considered again.

One MP for the Lancashire region today fumed they had been told "p*ss all" by government and had not been invited to a briefing.

But Burnley mayor Wajid Khan had told Sky News it "looks like Lancashire will be moving into Tier 3" and there would be a meeting on Friday morning to "finalise" that deal.

Workers whose venues are shut down will be able to claim two-thirds of their normal wages in Tier 3 areas.

But that will leave many pub staff on less than minimum wage, potentially for months, while venues remain shut.

And venues not formally ordered to close by the government can only get 22% of wage support for workers on a third of their normal hours.

Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham yesterday hit out at the plans to shut pubs and bars in the city.

In a powerful city centre outdoor declaration, he said Manchester would not be "canaries in the coal mine" testing experimental measures without proper wage support.

But today a top ally of Boris Johnson said he could defy a revolt from Northern leaders and impose the toughest restrictions on Greater Manchester later.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warned ministers “have the power to proceed” with pushing Greater Manchester into the highest level of lockdown - despite fierce opposition from local leaders.

Talks will continue between the Government and leaders in the North West on moving into the highest Tier 3 lockdown, he said, but warned: "Obviously in the last resort the government has the powers to proceed in any event."

In a round of interviews, Mr Raab struck a bullish tone, saying it was “very important that we act now” and "local leaders should “show the leadership for which they were elected”.

In a clear threat to overrule councils, he told the BBC: “We can’t have a situation where Andy Burnham is effectively saying 'unless you give us what we want, we’re not going to do the right thing' in terms of following the new rules which will protect the very people of Manchester he’s elected to represent.”

Mr Burnham hit back, tweeting: “It’s not about what we want for ourselves Dominic Raab. It’s about what we want for low-paid and self-employed people everywhere: fairness.”

Manchester City Council leader Richard Leese said government support of just £8 per head "simply isn't enough" and demanded extra measures, including a ban on off-licence alcohol sales after 10pm.

Speaking at 7am he said a meeting due with the government on Thursday night had been postponed and no further meetings had yet been arranged.

In a joint statement at 11am, the mayors of Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region and North of Tyne said: "The Government is claiming that the North is divided and only interested in getting what we can for our own region. That is simply not the case.

“We are all united in fighting for an 80% furlough scheme for all people affected by regional lockdowns, wherever they are in the country.

"Paying two-thirds of salaries will not be enough to protect the jobs of thousands – it should at least match the 80% that was available under furlough, with the minimum wage as the minimum support.

"The Universal Credit top up is not the answer. It doesn’t help everybody and takes weeks to come through. It will not prevent severe hardship for thousands of low paid workers before Christmas.

“But we won’t forget the self-employed and freelancers and other business who will be affected by these lockdowns, they also need support and we stand firm for those too.

“This is a fight for what is right.”

Rules for Tier 3 - 'very high'

Social contact: You cannot meet anyone outside your household or support bubble indoors. Strict rules also ban any meet-ups in private gardens, beer gardens, hospitality or ticketed venues. You will only be able to see people not in your household or bubble is in a public open space, such as a park, forest, beach - and in groups of no more than six.

Pubs and restaurants: All bars must close unless they serve food. You can only buy alcohol if you are also consuming a "substantial meal" - not a bar snack.

Schools, universities and childcare: These remain open in all circumstances, but universities can do more online learning.

Travel and transport: You should limit any journeys made outside your local area - except for work and school run journeys. This is guidance, rather than the law. People are advised against overnight stays outside the area or having visitors to stay from elsewhere.

Work: The advice is to work from home if you can.

Weddings and funerals: 15 guests can attend marriage ceremonies but receptions are banned. Funerals can have up to 30 mourners, with only 15 people allowed at the wake.

Shops: All retail - including non-essential shops - can stay open.

Gyms, hairdressers, public facilities: Local areas can negotiate whether to close facilities including casinos and gyms, such as they have in the Liverpool City Region.

Sports: Organised indoor sport and exercise classes can continue to take place, provided rule of six is observed

Length of time: Regulations will be reviewed every 28 days and expire after 6 months.

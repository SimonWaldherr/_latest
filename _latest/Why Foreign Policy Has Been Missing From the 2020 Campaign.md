Afghanistan was mentioned 23 times during the 2012 vice presidential debate between then-Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Vice President Mike Pence did not reference it once during their face-off last week, a particularly notable absence as this year's debate fell on the 19th anniversary of the beginning of America's longest war.

The dearth of foreign policy and national security discussions is not limited to U.S. conflicts nor the latest political matchup. International issues have held a minor role throughout the campaign season for the November election, limited only to passing references or broad assertions left unchallenged by political opponents or moderators.

Even references to the central foreign policy concerns of Russia and China have been framed largely around their domestic implications, namely interference in election security and the local effect of President Donald Trump's trade wars.

Analysts see a clear decline in public interest in global events that spans decades but particularly culminates now, when so much at home demands attention: the ravaging effects of the coronavirus, turbulent markets and financial systems, broad societal unrest and a reckoning with America's long history of racial injustice.

"This election is dominated by Donald Trump's character, various wedge issues, and the pandemic and economy," says Bjorn Ottosson, a researcher who specializes in U.S. policy at Sweden's Defence Research Agency. "Foreign policy is simply crowded out."

There is no shortage of global problems that historically required consistent U.S. positions that a candidate for the highest office would usually try to articulate: Civil war and terrorist threats rage in Syria, political turmoil roils Venezuela, North Korea continues its march toward a nuclear stockpile, Libya and Yemen are at risk of becoming failed states and extremist havens, NATO ally Turkey foments instability in the region, including in the burgeoning conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. And, of course, global issues require fervent American input, perhaps most notably climate change.

Yet this year's election also follows a broader trend of political leaders having fewer answers for increasingly complex global concerns. In Afghanistan, it's unclear how, for example, the military could support a viable and much-needed special operations counterterrorism mission if a president were to maintain those forces but withdraw the thousands of conventional troops and the massive infrastructure they provide – a proposal touted, unchallenged, by Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg during the primary season.

Nor is there a clear answer to the intensely complicated question Harris and Pence faced – and largely ignored – during their debate on Wednesday: Is China America's competitor, adversary or enemy?

"With the exception of 2004, foreign policy hasn't been important in any presidential race since the end of the Cold War, unless you count immigration as a foreign policy issue," says Robert Jervis, the author of several books about international relations and the presidency and a professor at Columbia University. "Foreign policy is simply too distant from the lives of most Americans."

"Afghanistan is interesting because the pressure to draw down to a very low number or to get out entirely comes from Trump – and is seconded by members of the foreign policy establishment who are in the 'restraint' camp – not the public," he adds. "Because casualties are low and the spending isn't salient, it doesn't concern the public at all, especially with issues of the pandemic and the economy being so pressing."

Those at the forefront of executing American foreign policy abroad are not surprised by the turn away from global affairs.

"Domestic issues are dominant right now, including COVID, the economy and social justice, and when combined with the fatigue associated with long overseas military commitments, there is not much air left," says retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who for the better part of the last decade commanded America's most forward-deployed forces, first overseeing all special operations missions before commanding all troops deployed to the Middle East.

Votel, who retired last year, does not believe the absence of focus on foreign-oriented missions and U.S. conflicts has much effect on those who carry out orders.

"Senior uniformed leaders are pretty astute and generally take a longer view on things. Being steady, patient and calm is a job requirement," he says.

Much of Trump's last campaign centered on issues involving foreign countries: blocking immigrants from coming to the U.S., returning troops home from bloody and costly wars abroad and reaching commercial parity with China. His administration has been marked by isolationist moves that appear to enliven his base – and enrage those who believe "America First" policies only leave America alone among its traditional global allies. Yet those issues have now dropped from public attention amid more pressing challenges, principally the spread of COVID-19. And the matters themselves in many ways have become less important than how each political party chooses to take a stand on them.

"Domestic issues and the partisan divide have grown so toxic and all-consuming that they drown out other important concerns," says Jennifer Cafarella, national security fellow at the Institute for the Study of War. "I believe this trend reflects a wider and growing civic crisis in the U.S. Most Americans do not have access to the kind of reliable, non-partisan, and non-sensationalized information they need in order to form judgements on national security related issues."

"To the extent that American leaders engage these issues absent public pressure, they largely do so in superficial and partisan-political terms that do not serve to educate the public nor stimulate reasonable debate," Cafarella says.

Foreign policy is typically reserved for the final debate between presidential candidates and has often through recent history held a lesser role in the overall process. That changed in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, a crisis that many Americans felt reached the same threat level they faced during the Cold War. During both periods, Americans judged the character of their prospective leaders by the kinds of wartime decisions they pledged they would make – circumstances that politicians at the time appeared to embrace.

"It's easier to make such assessments about character when talking about war and peace than when talking about the intricacies of health care reform or the tax code," says Michael O'Hanlon, director of research at the Brookings Institution. However, this year, the same is not necessarily true for Biden or Trump. "In this case, there are so many other ways to peer into our candidates' personalities and leadership styles and traits that we don't need classic foreign policy issues as much as we usually do."

Foreign policy experience is often an area in which an incumbent president has a decisive edge over a challenger, yet Trump has made little effort during the campaign to portray himself as a statesman or a global leader. The lack of focus on international issues is also surprising for Biden, who made a name for himself in that area during his 36-year Senate tenure. When Jon Alterman was a young staffer for the late Sen. Daniel Moynihan, he recalls Biden in closed-door Foreign Relations Committee meetings frequently repeating a line that represented an expeditionary approach to America's role in the world: "I went to Geneva and spoke to the Soviets – eyeball to eyeball."

"He comes from a generation with the presumption of the existential importance of foreign policy," says Alterman, now a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "I think there's a challenge for American leaders to articulate to Americans why they really should care."

George W. Bush was forced into the international realm in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent war on terror, but foreign policy in his first campaign was limited to conventional Republican ideas with a much greater focus on domestic policy, Alterman says. During the Obama administration, many of the responsibilities Biden undertook, including the peace process in Iraq, resulted in less notable procedural victories, rather than the kinds of high-profile and publicly accessible wins that can define an administration – "singles, and not home runs."

Otherwise, America has friendly neighbors to its north and south, thousands of miles of fishing grounds to the east and west, and a population that doesn't have to notice the effects of events elsewhere.

The hastened talks come after three months of plodding negotiations and failure from both political parties to pass their own proposals.

The Paycheck Protection Program expired at the end of July with $130 billion in unused funds, suggesting eligible small businesses took what they needed and have been able to stay solvent, Shah said.</p><p>The unemployment rate, while still elevated, continues to trend lower.

While some monthly gauges such as purchasing managers' indexes showed a sharp increase after the March plunge, high-frequency indicators and metrics tracking industrial production do a better job at detailing the US recovery, she said. Activity remains well off its pre-pandemic peak and likely won't reach those levels until late 2021 or early 2022, she added.</p><p>"When you have a complete lockdown, invariably there's going to be a rebound," Shah said. "Unfortunately, a lot of those tailwinds have started to fade and it's an uphill battle now." &#13;

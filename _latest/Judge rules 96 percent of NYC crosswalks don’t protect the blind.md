<div><p>Big Apple crosswalks aren&#8217;t accessible for blind pedestrians, a judge ruled Tuesday in a suit against the city.</p>
<p>The American Council of the Blind of New York, Inc. filed suit in June 2018 against the city, the mayor, the Department of Transportation and the DOT commissioner claiming that they have &#8220;long failed&#8221; to provide crosswalk signal information that a blind or low-vision person can use &#8212; instead relying on visual signals at the majority of intersections, according to the decision.</p>
<p>Manhattan Federal Judge Paul Engelmayer sided with ACBNY finding, &#8220;that the near-total absence of the city&#8217;s signalized intersections of crossing information accessible to blind and low-vision pedestrians denies such persons meaningful access to these intersections,&#8221; violating federal and state statutes, the decision says.</p>
<p>Of the city&#8217;s &#8220;13,200 signalized intersections, all but 443 (roughly 96.6%) communicate crossing information exclusively in a visual format &#8230; with an image of a mid-stride white stick figure indicating &#8216;walk,&#8217; and an upraised orange hand indicating &#8216;don&#8217;t walk,'&#8221; the ruling reads. &#8220;These visual signals are inaccessible to the blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the judge found the city liable in the lawsuit, he said the case must still proceed to determine how to remedy the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled with the dramatic changes that this victory will mean not only for those who are blind or low vision, but for all new Yorkers who want safer streets,&#8221; plaintiff lawyer Torie Atkinson said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American Council of the Blind of New York is very pleased with the verdict in this particular case,&#8221; said ACBNY president Karen Blachowicz</p>
<p>&#8220;The City is dedicated to making our streets more accessible to all New Yorkers with and without disabilities, including those who are blind or have low vision,&#8221; said Laura Freyer, a spokesperson in the mayor&#8217;s office.&#160; &#8220;We will continue to install Accessible Pedestrian Signals across the City and are consistently working to increase access for the blind and low vision community in all facets of life.&#8221;</p>

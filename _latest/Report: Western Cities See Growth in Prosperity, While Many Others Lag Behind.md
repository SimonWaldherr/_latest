The number of people living in prosperous, urban ZIP codes has nearly doubled since the turn of the century, according to a new report from the Economic Innovation Group, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy organization.

But the picture for the country's urban areas is complicated, as 61 out of 100 of the largest cities in the U.S. saw no change in prosperity, or even experienced a decrease.

The Distressed Communities Index, which measures the prosperity and distress of ZIP codes throughout the country, found that 20.2% of people (18.6 million) in urban areas lived in prospering ZIP codes in 2018, up from 14.6% (9.6 million) in 2000. Cities in the West, such as Provo, Utah, and Colorado Springs, Colorado, accounted for the higher numbers of urbanites living in increased prosperity. Half of all prosperous urban ZIP codes nationwide were in the West.

The index, first launched in 2015, measures economic well-being using seven categories taken from census data: high school diploma status, housing vacancy rate, share of adults not working, poverty rate, median income ratio, change in employment and change in business establishment. All seven measures, combined and averaged, make up each ZIP code's score from 0 to 100, higher being more distressed.

At the start of the 21st century, urban areas were often associated with economic distress. But today, according to the index, small towns have taken up that mantle. Urban areas are becoming more affluent, while the suburbs – the most prosperous part of the country – remain stable.

The index shows that five of the top 10 metropolitan areas with the most prosperous ZIP codes are located in the West – the region that has seen the most growth over the past two decades. These prosperous cities, and others like them, bring in high-paying industries and contribute to overall job opportunities and business advancement, according to the report.

"They've been the bright spots in the national economy for several years now," says Kenan Fikri, director of research at the Economic Innovation Group. He notes that several of the West Coast cities that performed well were also digital hubs and tech economies. "They have high paying white collar jobs that employ a lot of people, and they're some of the ones that rise to the top."

Here are the 10 major metro areas with the highest proportion of residents in prosperous ZIP codes, according to the index:



Metro Area Proportion of residents in prosperous ZIP codes Madison, Wisconsin 64.30% Minneapolis, Minnesota 60.90% Provo, Utah 57.90% Colorado Springs, Colorado 54.60% Des Moines, Iowa 53.40% Ogden, Utah 52.80% Denver, Colorado 52.70% Portland, Maine 52.70% Seattle, Washington 52% Grand Rapids, Michigan 51.60%



Not all cities analyzed in the index, however, saw high levels of prosperity. In the Midwest and Northeast especially, chronic distress exists in urban areas.

"We do have a large number of cities, especially in the rust belt and the Midwest in highly segregated cities in that region, that have seen very little progress since 2000, and their conditions haven't changed," Fikri says.

Communities of color are disproportionately likely to be economically distressed. Black, Native American, Hispanic, Asian and individuals of multiple races make up over half of the total population of distressed communities (56.4%), although they represent 39% of the nationwide population.

Although the index found distress throughout the country, eight out of the 10 most distressed metropolitan areas are located in Southern states. Four of the most distressed urban areas – Memphis, Tennessee; Jackson, Mississippi; El Paso, Texas; and Bakersfield, California – have a majority-minority population.

"It goes to show that even in 2020, separate in the United States is unequal by definition, and especially for the group that starts from an initial disadvantage," Fikri says.

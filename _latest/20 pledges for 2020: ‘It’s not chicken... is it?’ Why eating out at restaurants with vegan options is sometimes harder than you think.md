  20 pledges for 2020: ‘It’s not chicken... is it?’ Why eating out at restaurants with vegan options is sometimes harder than you think 
description: > 
  I went to Megan’s restaurant in Kensington with two colleagues and immediately knew what I wanted to order, the “posh deconstructed plant-based chickn with piri piri and coconut yoghurt”.I ran a poll on my Instagram the same day to see what people thought, was it chicken or chickn?Maybe with that one, I’m safe.If it’s the same dish, I’m safe – if not then I’ll probably never admit it to anyone.It reassured me that maybe the chicken at Megan’s really was chickn.

<div><p class="sc-pHJJA iocNwz above-article-prompt-donations"></p><p class="sc-qPyvj qchtz">I</p><p> have a confession: I might have eaten chicken a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>But I didn&#8217;t mean to &#8211; and I&#8217;m still not sure if I actually did.</p><p>I went to <a class="body-link" href="https://megans.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Megan&#8217;s</a> restaurant in Kensington with two colleagues and immediately knew what I wanted to order, the &#8220;posh deconstructed plant-based chickn with piri piri and coconut yoghurt&#8221;. Megan&#8217;s is a picturesque, Instagrammable sort of place which prides itself on presentation.</p><p id="article-im-prompt"></p><p>The &#8220;chickn&#8221; lived up to expectation. It looked beautiful and tasted even better. There&#8217;s just one problem: I think it might have been actual chicken. I took one bite and thought this is too good to be true. Even my meat-eating colleagues were confused. I felt too nervous to ask the waiting staff and potentially look silly &#8211; or, rather, admit to myself that I had messed up so early into my new diet/challenge.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, I carried on eating it and didn&#8217;t really look back. It was that good.</p><p>I ran a poll on my Instagram the same day to see what people thought, was it chicken or chickn? Around 60% voted for the latter. I quizzed my colleagues: most said they thought it wasn&#8217;t real meat. But were they being honest or just trying to make me feel better?</p><p>Maybe with that one, I&#8217;m safe. I suppose the ultimate test will be going back and ordering it again. If it&#8217;s the same dish, I&#8217;m safe &#8211; if not then I&#8217;ll probably never admit it to anyone.</p><p></p><p>I&#8217;ve included a picture of the food above &#8211; let me know what you think it is. You might have had it yourself and can help dispel my guilty feeling.</p><p></p><p>I came across a similar issue when I ate out at <a href="https://eatspicebox.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link">SpiceBox</a> last week &#8211; if you haven&#8217;t been, you need to go, whether you&#8217;re <a href="/topic/vegan" class="body-link">vegan</a> or not.</p><p>It&#8217;s a vegan-only restaurant so I didn&#8217;t need to ask the question, but one of the dishes was so good even our table neighbours made a comment to me that she couldn&#8217;t tell the difference.</p><p id="taboola-carousel-thumbnails"></p><p>It reassured me that maybe the chicken at Megan&#8217;s really was chickn. Maybe I haven&#8217;t broken my pledge after all.</p><p>So why hasn&#8217;t the guilty feeling left me?</p></div>

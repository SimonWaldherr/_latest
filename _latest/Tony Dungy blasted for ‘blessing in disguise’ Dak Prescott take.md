Read the room, Tony.

NBC Sports analyst and former Colts coach Tony Dungy was under social-media fire for his tone-deaf reaction to Dak Prescott’s horrifying compound ankle fracture suffered on Sunday.

“As tough as this is for Dak Prescott, it might be a blessing in disguise for the Cowboys,” Dungy said before the “Sunday Night Football” game. “They’ve got a good, veteran quarterback that can make some plays that might cause them to get back to their old formula, lean back to the running game, lean back to Ezekiel Elliott, help the defense out by controlling the ball. You still got wide receivers and Andy Dalton is going to make some plays with those receivers.”

Dungy’s comments came as the football-watching country was still digesting the disturbing scene of the Cowboys quarterback in tears as he was getting carted off the field. Prescott would immediately be taken to the hospital to have surgery. It wasn’t quite silver-lining time.

As the Twitter mob grew, Dungy attempted to clarify his comments.

“Blessing in disguise was a poor choice of words by me,” Dungy wrote on Twitter. “It’s not a blessing for Dak. What I meant was that for the Cowboys the season is not over. Andy Dalton is very capable and changing the focus back to Elliott could help the defense. But I feel very badly for Dak.”

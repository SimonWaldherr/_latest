  Will Florida, the Recount State, Be Ready for the Election? 
description: > 
  Reasonable predictions suggest that the legal wrangling over the results could stretch far beyond election night.Is Florida ready?Elections officials say yes.But this is Florida, the nation’s biggest presidential battleground and a mirror of American polarization, where winning an election by more than a percentage point is considered a landslide.Florida allows voters to “cure” deficient ballots but that requires time for supervisors to notify them of the problem.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Now the state, like the rest of the nation, faces perhaps the most daunting test yet: a 2020 election conducted in the midst of a pandemic, amid <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/magazine/trump-voter-fraud.html" title="">unsubstantiated fraud claims</a> spread by the president and others. Reasonable predictions suggest that the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/us/politics/voting-nov-3-election.html" title="">legal wrangling over the results</a> could stretch far beyond election night.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Is Florida ready?</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Elections officials say yes. With the snafus of years past, they say, have come lessons that prepared the state to process a crush of mail ballots and juggle the logistics of the coronavirus, such as securing drop boxes and distributing hand sanitizer.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But this is Florida, the nation&#8217;s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/us/politics/florida-trump-biden-2020.html" title="">biggest presidential battleground</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/can-democrats-win-back-florida.html" title="">a mirror of American polarization</a>, where winning an election by more than a percentage point is considered a landslide. And here, to crib Faulkner, the past is never really past.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/politics/how-prepared-are-these-7-battlegrounds-for-the-election-a-readiness-report.html" title="">most pressing concern</a> is the surge in mail ballots expected as a result of the pandemic and a corresponding rise in envelopes missing signatures or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/voting-signatures-matching-elections.html" title="">signatures not matching the ones on file</a>, both of which could result in rejected votes. Florida allows voters to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/23/upshot/mail-ballots-states-disqualification.html" title="">&#8220;cure&#8221; deficient ballots</a> but that requires time for supervisors to notify them of the problem.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That vulnerability is obvious. Others are less so.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">An intrusion by Russian hackers into at least two Florida counties in 2016 has never been fully explained, raising questions about whether the state might be open to attack again, in spite of a slew of upgrades that officials contend have secured the system.</p></div>

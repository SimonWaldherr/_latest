<div><p>A Maryland man is accused of firing a shotgun at a passing truck with a Trump campaign sign that honked as he was installing a Black Lives Matter sign on Saturday, new reports said.</p>
<p>Douglas Kuhn, 50, was arrested and charged with assault over the alleged shooting outside his Kingsville home at about 2:30 p.m., authorities said.</p>
<p>The truck &#8212; with Trump supporters Neal Houk and his son, Bradley Lang, inside &#8212; was not hit by the gunfire, <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/kingsville-man-posting-biden-sign-shoots-at-honking-trump-supporters-police-say/34414364#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WBAL reported</a>.</p>
<p>The father-son duo told the network they meant no harm by honking at Kuhn as he placed the sign on his property.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Kingsville, it&#8217;s a friendly area,&#8221; Land said. &#8220;Everyone honks at each other. We think we were hoping there could be some civility between people who support different candidates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Added Lang: &#8220;He obviously has his political beliefs, as he showed with his signs. We were expressing those same rights, and he attacked us for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kuhn, when being questioned by police, did not acknowledge the alleged shooting, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-county/cng-co-to-kingsville-man-no-bail-20201019-s3ff2seiv5aytpe6kisgl2v5ti-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Baltimore Sun</a> reported. He was ordered by a judge at a Monday bail review hearing to serve home detention.</p>
<p>Kuhn has no prior criminal history and is expected to plead not guilty, the newspaper reported, citing the suspect&#8217;s lawyer.</p>

  “You grew up on a farm, you should know this,” the moderator said cruelly.Ernst took a shot at $5.50 which was about half of what a farmer actually needs to get.We have no idea whether the voters in Iowa are going to hold this against her — right now the race is a tossup.Iowa is one of the 2016 Trump states the Democrats are trying to capture.If it happens, all future political hopefuls are going to have to devote a heck of a lot of time studying commodity reports.

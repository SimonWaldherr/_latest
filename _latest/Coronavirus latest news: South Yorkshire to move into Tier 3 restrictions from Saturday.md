<div><p>A anonymous contact tracer, who works as a mental health professional, said he has had "alarming" conversations with people, particularly students, who are "distressed and upset".</p>
<p>Although he can pass the details on to a team leader, he never hears the outcome of the patient.</p>
<p>He said: "I've spoken to many students now, from many universities, often freshers, who are distressed and upset obviously because they are not getting their normal student experience but also because they are away from home for the first time and it's a difficult time for them.</p>
<p>"When you phone someone who is in complete bits and complete meltdown we're supposed to stick to a very strict script, it's not my job to be their counsellor, but when no one else is, what do you do?"</p>
<p>He added that sometimes he has become a "de factor" counsellor to students.</p>
<p>"You can't stick to a script when you are talking to a young person who is in distress and has no one else to speak to," he said.</p>
<p>Some universities pastoral care services have not been up to scratch, he added.</p>
<p>"Some of these fresher students have had very little, if any, contact with the university at all, and some of them have told me they've tried to contact the pastoral care services to get a voice recorded message to say that due to the corona crisis they are operating at a minimalist services and get nothing from them.</p>
<p>"The trouble is that encourages risky behaviour, some of them will go home to mum and dad and on several occasions I've come across students who have done that, thinking they're well, they arrived home to find out one of their bubble has tested positive and then gone on to infect their families."</p>

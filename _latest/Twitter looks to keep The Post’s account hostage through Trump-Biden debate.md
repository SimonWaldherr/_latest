  Twitter looks to keep The Post’s account hostage through Trump-Biden debate 
description: > 
  It’s now been a week since Twitter locked The Post’s account over its exposé on Hunter Biden’s emails — and it appears the hostage situation will continue through the final presidential debate on Thursday.The social media giant is refusing to unlock The Post’s main account unless the news organization deletes six tweets about its own reporting on Joe Biden’s son.Twitter locked The Post’s main account Oct. 14, when the news org published the first article in its series of bombshell reports.It remained blocked despite Twitter changing its policy on Oct. 15 and allowing other users to tweet the very same links, following outrage over the social-media suppression of the stories.In an email on Oct. 16, a Twitter representative told The Post, “While we’ve updated the policy, we don’t change enforcement retroactively.

<div><p>It&#8217;s now been a week since Twitter locked The Post&#8217;s account <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">over its expos&#233;</a> on Hunter Biden&#8217;s emails &#8212; and it appears the hostage situation will continue through the final presidential debate on Thursday.</p>
<p>The social media giant is<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/twitter-still-holding-the-posts-account-hostage-over-hunter-biden-links/"> refusing to unlock The Post&#8217;s main account</a> unless the news organization deletes six tweets about its own reporting on Joe Biden&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>This means The Post may not be able to share its coverage of the last showdown between President Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden ahead of the Nov. 3 election with its close to 2 million followers.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/facebook-twitter-block-the-post-from-posting/">locked The Post&#8217;s main account</a> Oct. 14, when the news org published the first article in its series of bombshell reports.</p>
<p>It remained blocked despite Twitter <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/twitter-changes-hacked-materials-guidelines-after-post-controversy/">changing its policy</a> on Oct. 15 and allowing other users to tweet the very same links, following outrage over the social-media suppression of the stories.</p>
<p>In an email on Oct. 16, a Twitter representative told The Post, &#8220;While we&#8217;ve updated the policy, we don&#8217;t change enforcement retroactively. You will still need to delete the Tweets to regain access to your account.&#8221;</p>
<p>But anyone who looks at The Post&#8217;s Twitter feed can&#8217;t even see the tweets about the Biden stories, which have been replaced by messages saying, &#8220;This Tweet is no longer available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/these-five-people-are-allowed-to-tweet-but-one-of-americas-oldest-newspapers-cant/">a slew of questionable characters</a> have still been able to send out missives on Twitter, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/fcc-staffer-ayatollah-khamenei-can-still-tweet-but-the-post-cant/">including Iran&#8217;s Supreme Leader</a> Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who once&#160;called for the destruction of Israel on the social media site.</p>
<p>Twitter didn&#8217;t immediately return a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.</p>

Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump’s third nomination to the Supreme Court, is on Capitol Hill for another day of senate confirmation hearings amid a backdrop of outcry from Democrats over Republican-led efforts to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during an election season in which 10 million Americans have already voted.

The federal judge faced tough questions from Democratic senators and declined to reveal whether she would support overturning key rulings on the Affordable Care Act and Roe v Wade, which, respectively, provides insurance protections for millions and ensures access to women’s reproductive health care options nationwide.

Former Vice President Joe Biden has also addressed questions from the president and his allies about so-called “court-packing” efforts, saying he was “not a fan” of adding seats to the nation’s top court in an interview on Monday. Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading epidemiologist, has warned the Trump campaign against a blitz of in-person events its planning across the country, telling CNN about the rise of new Covid-19 cases: “The data speaks for itself.”

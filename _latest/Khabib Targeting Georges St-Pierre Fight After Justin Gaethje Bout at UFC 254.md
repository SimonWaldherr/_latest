description: > 
  Jon Gambrell/Associated PressKhabib Nurmagomedov still has to dispatch Justin Gaethje at UFC 254 on Saturday, but he's already setting his sights on his next fight.The UFC lightweight champion said Tuesday on ESPN's First Take that he'd relish the opportunity to oppose 2020 Hall of Fame inductee Georges St-Pierre."And I think me vs. Georges is going to be very, very big fight.Like big fight for fans, big fight for pay-per-view, big fight for analytics, for everybody.There's probably no bigger money fight in UFC than Khabib vs. McGregor right now.

The winner of their encounter could be the next in line for the current champion.</p><p class="">Nurmagomedov has wins over both fighters, though, and he said on&#160;First Take&#160;he has little interest in any rematches:</p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png">Video Play Button</a><p class="atom video-indicator"><p class="text">Videos you might like </p> </p><p class="youtubeEmbed molecule"></p><p class="">St-Pierre hasn't fought since beating Michael Bisping by third-round submission in November 2017, and that was his first bout since stepping away from <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/mma">MMA</a> in 2013. The 39-year-old is widely regarded as one of the greatest pound-for-pound fighters ever, so he has nothing left to prove inside the cage.</p><p class="">Still, St-Pierre told ESPN's&#160;<a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/30063858/khabib-nurmagomedov-only-option-possible-ufc-return" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Raimondi</a>&#160;that a bout with&#160;Nurmagomedov could coax him out of retirement:</p><p class="">"If I ever come back, I'm not coming back for many fights.&#160;If I come back, it would be for one fight. And I need to take, for me, the biggest fish. And the one&#8212;for me, I believe&#8212;the top guy right now, the name is Khabib. As a fighter, the most exciting thing is to take the guy who seems invincible, unbeatable. He has the aura of invincibility.

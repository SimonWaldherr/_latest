 <p>     </p> <p>She said: "Both were seen in the street shoving one another and shouting insults.</p> <p>"The officer was approached by male and then the female, she was saying: 'I want him nicked'.</p> <p>"She then charged towards the male and the officer attempted to arrest her putting her in a restraint.</p> <p>"As he attempted to handcuff her she slipped his grasp and he took her to the floor.</p> <p>"It is said she then punched him and he was forced to continue to restrain her."</p> <p>Cardiff magistrates heard the police officer had to restrain Butts who tried to punch him - but as he did so Perrett stormed towards them.</p> <p>Miss Johnson said: "She is then alleged to have thrown another punch. It is unclear if that connected.</p> <p>"The officer has then had to use his Taser to control the situation."</p>

 <p>Perrett and Butts admitted assaulting an emergency worker and using threatening words or behaviour to cause fear of violence.</p> <p>Tom Trobe, defending, said Perrett had been left with "substantial injuries" following the incident including a black eye.</p> <p>He added: "The most serious injury that she suffered was the loss of her child. She was three months pregnant.</p> <p>"While there is no medical evidence to say that this was the direct cause, she lost the baby in the subsequent days.</p> <p>"She accepts this was an unpleasant incident where violence need not have occurred."</p> <p>Mr Trobe said Butts had thrown a punch at the police officer after Perrett was hit.</p> <p>He said: "This was an emotive situation and not a pre-planned offence."</p>

   <p>Mr Trobe said Perrett suffered from a psychiatric disorder and had been unable to get appropriate medical appointments during the pandemic.</p> <p>He said that both she and Butts had suffered from drug addictions at the time of the incident on June 20 but had both were now complying with treatment programs.</p> <p>District Judge Shoman Khan told the pair the police officer had been right to use his taser.</p> <p>He said: "The officer's reaction was instinctive, it was a heated situation and I thought he dealt with it very well."</p> <p>Butts, of Llantwit Major, South Wales, was handed an eight week suspended sentence and a nine month drug rehabilitation order.</p> <p>Perrett, also of Llantwit Major, was handed a 16 week suspended sentence and ordered to do a thinking skills programme.</p>

   <p>Judge Khan told them: "If you commit more offences you bring them on yourselves just like you did in this incident."</p> <p>Speaking outside court, Perrett said: "I suffered a miscarriage after it happened. I was three months pregnant and I lost the baby.</p> <p>"I know that's what caused it."</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>Perrett says there was no need for her to be tasered over what was a row between her and her partner.</p> <p>She said: "The first thing I remember was waking up and being pushed into the back of the police van.</p> <p>"They had to lift me in because I couldn't stand up - my legs just wouldn't work.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>"I thought I had broken my cheekbones as I was in so much pain and I had a black eye that stayed for over three weeks.</p> <p>"The copper's reaction was completely over the top, he was well out of order. He had no need to taser me.</p> <p>"My mum saw the video afterwards and was crying."</p></div>

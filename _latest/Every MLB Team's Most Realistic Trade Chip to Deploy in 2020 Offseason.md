  Every MLB Team's Most Realistic Trade Chip to Deploy in 2020 Offseason 
description: > 
  0 of 30Tony Dejak/Associated PressAll eyes are on the World Series, but its arrival also means Major League Baseball's 2020-21 offseason is nigh.Because teams will invariably find themselves weighing trade possibilities, we thought we'd try to pinpoint each club's most realistic trade chip.This involved looking for major leaguers who might be getting too expensive for their clubs or who are simply expendable in some way.We also considered the possibility that some teams will instead deal from their prospect depth and asked which specific young players they might be willing to part with.We'll proceed in alphabetical order by city.

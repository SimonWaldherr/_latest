<div><p>Boeing&#8217;s stock price soared early Friday as Europe&#8217;s top aviation regulator said the company&#8217;s beleaguered 737 MAX plane was safe enough to start flying again.</p>
<p>Shares in the Chicago-based planemaker rose about 5.5 percent in premarket trading to $173.40&#160;as of 8:44 a.m.&#160;after Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, said the troubled jet could return to service in Europe by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our analysis is showing that this is safe, and the level of safety reached is high enough for us,&#8221; Ky <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-16/boeing-max-declared-safe-to-fly-by-europe-s-aviation-regulator?sref=rEjryNCU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Bloomberg News</a> in an interview published Friday.</p>
<p>The 737 MAX, once Boeing&#8217;s fastest-selling plane, was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes that killed 346 people. The crisis sparked probes by American authorities and led the company to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/23/boeing-ceo-resigns-after-continued-backlash-over-737-max-plane-crashes/">oust CEO Dennis Muilenburg</a> and replace him with David Calhoun, the current chief.</p>
<p>Boeing is still waiting for the Federal Aviation Administration to let the 737 MAX return to service in the US. FAA chief Steve Dickson <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-737max/i-like-what-i-saw-u-s-faa-chief-on-boeing-737-max-test-flight-idUSKBN26L0ZI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he &#8220;like[d] what I saw&#8221; when he personally flew the plane last month, but added that regulators were not yet ready to complete the approval process.</p>
<p>Boeing also has some hurdles left to clear in Europe &#8212; regulators there expect to issue a draft airworthiness directive for the MAX next month, with four weeks of public comment to follow, Ky told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>The company also has to develop a &#8220;synthetic sensor&#8221; meant to make it simpler for pilots to handle situations in which one or both of the plane&#8217;s mechanical &#8220;angle-of-attack&#8221; sensors fail, according to the news service. That process could reportedly take up to two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really looking into this new aircraft and we are making sure that ours and Boeing&#8217;s safety assessment is done properly and doesn&#8217;t leave any questions unanswered,&#8221; Ky told Bloomberg.</p>

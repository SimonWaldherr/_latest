description: > 
  Specialist insurance provider Pension Insurance Corporation (PIC) has agreed to buy out the Old British Steel Pension Scheme and take responsibility for more than 30,000 workers' retirement funds.The scheme was dumped into the Government's pensions lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), after former owner Tata Steel restructured its business in 2017.The British Steel pension scheme is not related to British Steel, the company that operates steelworks in Scunthorpe and bought out of liquidation by Chinese group Jingye.Under the deal, Tata agreed to shut the final salary pension scheme and replace it with a less generous alternative.Most of the British Steel Pension Scheme's 120,000 or so members chose to transfer into a new fund in 2018.

<p>Allan Spence, of Network Rail, said: "Wedding photos or selfies on the track are just plain stupidity.</p> <p>"We often warn families at this time of year as kids enjoy school half term holidays but this time we are appealing to adults in particular.</p> <p>"Please, make sure you know the rail safety basics and pass that knowledge onto your loved ones. Lead by example and stay off the tracks."</p> <p>HM chief inspector of railways Ian Prosser said: "We keep seeing people take unnecessary risks around the railway and this behaviour could result in fatal or life-changing consequences.</p> <p>"These new statistics showing the increase is truly worrying. The hidden dangers on the railway are real: each year hundreds take on the railway and lose and their actions have far-reaching and devastating consequences for their friends and family."</p></div>

Tim Cronic, a real estate lawyer who was involved in the initial transaction, confirmed that the Tubervilles “would’ve never talked to Copeland” and Mr. Copeland would have only been hired through an intermediary.

Another notable venture of Mr. Tuberville’s is a charity he founded in 2014 to aid veterans. A review of five years of the foundation’s tax records showed that less than a third of the money raised went to its charitable mission. (The Better Business Bureau recommends at least 65 percent.)

“For a very small charity, you have these huge expenses,” said David Nelson, a retired partner at Ernst & Young who has specialized in tax-exempt groups, and who reviewed the foundation’s public filings at The Times’s request. “The other thing that jumped out is that out of the amounts of money they collected, a relatively small amount was being directed to charitable activities,” Mr. Nelson said.

The campaign, along with people connected to the foundation, said there was a far greater level of spending on the foundation’s charitable mission than the I.R.S. records indicate, and produced internal records for 2018 that showed nearly $20,000 was raised for a temporary project to provide a retreat for veterans. But the records raised bookkeeping questions, since they showed more than $61,000 of 2018 revenue, roughly twice what the charity reported to the I.R.S. that year.

Mr. Nelson said the public records showed other signs of sloppiness, including one year when the foundation filed the wrong tax form.

Mr. Shashy said Mr. Tuberville was inspired to start the charity because his father was a veteran who took part in the Normandy landing.

“It seems that any criticism of the foundation, its size and its work argues that a man who was generous, selfless and charitable with his own money simply wasn’t generous, selfless and charitable enough,” he said. “That is an unfair, arbitrary and subjective standard that simply cannot be met.”

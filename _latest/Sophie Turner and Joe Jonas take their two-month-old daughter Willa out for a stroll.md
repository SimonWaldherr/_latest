New parents Sophie Turner, 24, and Joe Jonas, 31, were spotted out for the second time this week with their infant daughter.

The Game of Thrones star and the pop musician were seen taking two-month-old Willa out for a stroll around their home in Los Angeles on Friday.

A few days earlier, the power couple made their first appearance out and about with the baby since welcoming her into the world in July.

Mom and dad kept their style low-key for their early morning walk with Willa, who was pushed in front in her stroller.

Sophie stepped out in a pair of thick soled slides and a light colored sweatsuit with a white T-shirt and the sweatshirt draped over her shoulders.

Her strawberry blonde hair was down and pulled back from her face with a pair of white rimmed sunglasses which she perched on her head.

Both Joe and Sophie put safety first and were wearing matching black protective face masks to ward off the spread of the coronavirus.

His recently dyed pink hair provided the only pop of color in the couple's ensemble. Joe colored his naturally raven hue to the pale pink color in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Earlier this week the duo were seen out for the first time with their baby since Sophie gave birth at the end of the summer.

Turner and Jonas confirmed the news of their new arrival in a July statement that said they were 'delighted to announce the birth of their baby.'

'The couple is already obsessed and can't stop gloating about their new addition,' a source told Entertainment Tonight.

'With the pandemic, Joe and Sophie have been very cautious about who is around them and their little girl.'

Joe and Sophie were first married during a surprise Las Vegas wedding in May 2019 which was broadcast live on Diplo's social media, and shortly followed up with a family affair in France two months later.

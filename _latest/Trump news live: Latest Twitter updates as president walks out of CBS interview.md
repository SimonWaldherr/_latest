description: > 
  US president Donald Trump on TuesdayDonald Trump stormed out of an interview with Lesley Stahl of CBS’s 60 Minutes being filmed at the White House on Tuesday, posting a clip of the reporter on Twitter shortly afterwards attacking her for not wearing a face mask and threatening to release his own cut of the “FAKE and BIASED” discussion before the network can broadcast its version.The president later attended a rally in Erie in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania at which he said there was “no way” he would have come to the area had the coronavirus pandemic not put his re-election hopes in jeopardy.“We’re going to win.I think we’re going to win so big,” he reassured the MAGA crowd, again painting an apocalyptic vision of a Joe Biden future before changing mood, griping that “nobody wants me” and cutting his speech unusually short due to the cold weather.

President Trump called on federal law enforcement to target the “Radical Left” and Antifa after rioters in Portland Sunday evening toppled statues of Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt during “day of rage” protests over the Christopher Columbus holiday.

“The FBI and Law Enforcement must focus their energy on ANTIFA and the Radical Left, those who have spent the summer trying to burn down poorly run Democrat Cities throughout the USA!,” the president wrote in a string of tweets Monday after the “indigenous peoples day of rage,” organized by a faction of Antifa.

“Taking advantage of fools. Law & Order! Portland, call in the Feds!,” Trump said in another posting.

The president, who has made law and order and criticism of the national riots following the killing of George Floyd a major part of his reelection campaign, also linked former Vice President Joe Biden to Antifa.

“These are Biden fools. ANTIFA RADICALS. Get them FBI, and get them now!,” Trump wrote, adding, “Put these animals in jail, now. The Radical Left only knows how to take advantage of very dumb ‘leadership’ fools. This is Biden! Law & Order!” in another.

The president also urged Americans to vote for him if they want the riots cleaned up.

“The Radical Left fools in Portland don’t want any help from real Law Enforcement which we will provide instantaneously. Vote!,” he said.

A crowd of about 200 people marched through Portland on Sunday, tearing down the two statues, breaking windows at the Oregon Historical Society and damaging storefronts.

Police declared a riot, ordered the crowds to disperse and responded in force to the protesters, according to the Oregonian.

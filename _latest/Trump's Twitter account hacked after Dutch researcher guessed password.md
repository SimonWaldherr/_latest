<p>Victor Gevers, a security expert, had access to Trump&#8217;s direct messages, could post tweets in his name and change his profile, <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/dutch-ethical-hacker-logs-into-trump-s-twitter-account~badaa815/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FDE5GNYHY4d%3Famp%3D1" class="u-underline">De Volkskrant newspaper reported</a>.</p>

<p>Gevers &#8211; who previously managed to log into Trump&#8217;s account in 2016 &#8211; gained access by guessing Trump&#8217;s password. He tried &#8220;maga2020!&#8221; on his fifth attempt and it worked. Maga stands for Trump&#8217;s oft used campaign slogan Make America Great Again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information,&#8221; Gevers told <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/trumps-twitteraccount-opnieuw-door-nederlandse-onderzoeker-gehackt~b4c86101/" class="u-underline">De Volkskrant</a>.</p>
<p>Gevers said the ease with which he accessed Trump&#8217;s account suggested the president was not using basic security measures like two-step verification.</p>
<p>Gaining access to Trump&#8217;s Twitter meant Gevers was suddenly able to connect with 87m users &#8211; the number of Trump&#8217;s followers &#8211; and according to De Volkskrant&#8217;s story, it sent him into a bit of a panic.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, he tries to warn others. Trump&#8217;s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump&#8217;s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response,&#8221; the paper <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/trumps-twitteraccount-opnieuw-door-nederlandse-onderzoeker-gehackt~b4c86101/" class="u-underline">reported</a>.</p>
<p>A day after he gained access, Gevers noticed that two-step verification had been activated on Trump&#8217;s account. Two days later, the Secret Service got in touch. According to De Volkskrant, they thanked him for bringing the security problem to their attention.</p>
<p>Remarkably, it wasn&#8217;t the first time Gevers has gained access to the president&#8217;s Twitter account. In 2016 he and two others guessed Trump&#8217;s password and got into his account.</p>
<p>Back then Trump&#8217;s password was &#8220;yourefired&#8221;, according to <a href="https://www.vn.nl/news-trump-twitter/" class="u-underline">VN news</a>.</p>

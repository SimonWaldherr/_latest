<div><h3>What if they want to visit me?</h3>
<p>The same rule applies. Even if you live outside the lockdown zone, they are not allowed to come to your home.&#160;</p>
<h3>I live in one of these areas. Can I see my family and friends?&#160;</h3>
<p>People living in the lockdown zones can meet in outdoor public spaces in groups of up to six people. They will still be required to socially distance.&#160;</p>
<h3>I'm a single parent. What about&#160;childcare?</h3>
<p>Single parents with children who were under the age of 18 on June 12, 2020, and people who are living alone are allowed to form an alliance with one other household of any size, as long as no-one is shielding. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/15/childcare-thrown-chaos-thousands-new-covid-restrictions-announced/">This is called a "childcare bubble"</a>.</p>
<p>Someone in one household&#160; can provide informal (unpaid and unregistered) childcare to a child aged 13 or under in another household.&#160;</p>
<p>Government guidance states that each childcare bubble must always be between the same two households.</p>
<p>This can include people in your support bubble and registered childcare providers, such as nannies, and people in your childcare bubble.</p>
<h3>Can I go to work?&#160;</h3>
<p>There is no restriction on travelling to and from the office, however the advice is to work from home if you can.&#160;</p>
<h3>Should I cancel my wedding?&#160;</h3>
<p>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are still permitted, with up to 15 people able to attend. However, large receptions or parties afterwards should not go ahead. People can also travel in and out of lockdown zones to attend weddings.&#160;</p>
<p>Funerals with up to 30 attendees can also take place.&#160;</p>

<h3>Can I go to a place of worship?&#160;</h3>
<p>You may attend a mosque, church, synagogue, temple or other place or worship, but you should socially distance from people outside of your household. Maintain a distance of two metres, or one metre&#160;if you are wearing a mask.</p>
<p>If possible, prayer or religious services should take place outdoors.</p>

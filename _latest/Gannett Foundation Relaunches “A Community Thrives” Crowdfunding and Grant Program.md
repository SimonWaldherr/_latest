USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

The Gannett Foundation yesterday launched its 2020 A Community Thrives program to support projects which contribute to community building with a preference for those impacting historically under-served individuals and groups. Nonprofit and municipal organizations with projects aimed at building their communities may apply to the nationwide crowdfunding and grant program, which is now in its fourth year, through Sept. 11. The more than $2 million A Community Thrives initiative is sponsored by the USA TODAY Network's parent company, Gannett Co., Inc.

Organizations typically apply to raise money for a specific project, and accepted organizations will work to raise funds on their own through a crowdfunding campaign and then may be eligible for more than 100 grants.

More than a dozen grants set to be distributed are considered national grants supporting projects, ranging from $25,000 to $100,000. Separately, incentives aimed at rewarding high-fundraising projects will be offered.

Dozens more regional grants will also be distributed for general operating support, starting at $2,500. These grants are chosen by local leaders across Gannett's nationwide USA TODAY Network of newsrooms.

Since the A Community Thrives initiative last took place in early 2019, Gannett has expanded the footprint of the USA TODAY Network after joining GateHouse Media to become the largest U.S. media company by print circulation, serving communities in 47 states. For nonprofits, that means more regions will be offering local grants.

Last year, more than $4.5 million was distributed to nonprofits as a result of the program. Applicants raised more than $2.5 million through their own fundraising efforts and The Gannett Foundation gave out another $2 million in grants.

Grants this year will be awarded based on the proposed projects' viability, sustainability, community need and service to historically disadvantaged groups.

"The Gannett Foundation grants will support our readers' top community-building ideas to help address local needs and ensure a vibrant, healthy community. We are committed to work in partnership to help our communities connect, act and thrive," said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, Gannett Media President of News and Gannett Foundation Vice President in a written statement.

Organizations may submit applications through Sept. 11 on A Community Thrives' website: acommunitythrives.mightycause.com.

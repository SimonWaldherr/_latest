Block blue light: Do not allow blue light into the bedroom and restrict this two hours from bedtime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. Set a goodnight alarm for your phone: At this point switch it off so you wake fully refreshed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. Diffuse lavender: Diffuse lavender either onto your pillows or throughout the room to promote relaxation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. Have an evening shower or bath: This helps to promote relaxation 45-60 minutes before bed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. Drink chamomile tea: Do this an hour before bed to make you calm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7. Take a magnesium supplement: This helps the muscles to relax.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">8. Practise gratitude: Think about what you are grateful for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">9. Try meditation: This can be useful to help you sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">10.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">MISTAKE FOUR: Sunday lie ins</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is nothing better than a sleep in on a Sunday, but while they can feel restorative at the weekend, by the time Monday comes around you might feel somewhat tired or jet-lagged.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Delaying the circadian rhythm - your biological clock to govern your sleep-wake hormones - a Sunday sleep in means you delay the release of the sleepiness hormone melatonin that evening,' Olivia said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a consequence, you won't feel as tired at the end of the day and might struggle to fall asleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If that wasn't bad enough, the next morning, because of the delay, you're more likely to be tired too,' Olivia added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of a Sunday sleep in, take a nap of either 30 or 90 minutes in the afternoon, as this will serve your sleep debt recovery without any repercussions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">MISTAKE FIVE: Not having a bathroom nightlight&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, if you don't have a nightlight in your bathroom, you're probably ruining your sleep patterns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Know that blue light, the spectrum of light suppressing melatonin and contributing to sleep difficulties, is also emitted from your bathroom's ceiling lights too,' Olivia said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this reason, even if you work hard to avoid devices and reduce blue light exposure, this will still be undone the minute you go into your bathroom to go to the toilet or take an evening shower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you're looking to improve your sleep, ideally avoid blue light for two hours before bed, and get everything done beforehand.&#160;</p></div>

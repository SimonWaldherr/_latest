<div><p>Christopher David Killip was born on July 11 1946 in the Highlander Inn, near Peel on the Isle of Man, a pub run by his father Alan and mother Molly (n&#233;e Quirk). Aged 15 the family moved to the island&#8217;s capital Douglas.</p>
<p>After leaving school aged 16, Chris joined the only four-star hotel on the island as a trainee hotel manager. When he was 17, however, a photograph in a battered copy of Paris Match by Henri Cartier-Bresson of a little Parisian boy carrying bottles of wine, caught his imagination. &#8220;I was mesmerised,&#8221; he recalled, &#8220;and slightly tortured, too. I knew it wasn&#8217;t a snapshot, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it was and that puzzled me greatly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although neither he nor any other family member owned a camera, he decided then and there to become a photographer.</p>
<p>He started as a beach photographer at a local seaside resort and in 1964 moved to London where he worked as an assistant to the advertising and celebrity portrait photographer Adrian Flowers. A 1969 visit to an exhibition of photographs at the Museum of Modern Art in New York convinced him that the medium might have a higher purpose, however, so he stopped his commercial work and returned to the Isle of Man to develop his own artistic vision.</p>
<p>By this time the island had become a tax haven and Killip decided to record the old ways of life which were about to change for ever. A series of photographs depicting traditional Manx work and culture was eventually published by the Arts Council as Isle of Man: A Book about the Manx in 1980 with a text by John Berger.</p>

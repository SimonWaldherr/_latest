Barrett offers a definition of severability and Obamacare Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member on the panel, asked Barrett about the severability of the Affordable Care Act and to provide a definition for it. "I think the doctrine of severability, as it's been described by the court, you know serves a valuable function of trying not to undo your work when you wouldn't want a court to undo your work," Barrett said. "Severability strives to look at a statute as a whole and say, would Congress have considered this provision so vital that, kind of in the Jenga game, pulling it out, Congress wouldn't want the statute anymore." "It's designed to effectuate your intent, but you know severability is designed to say well, would Congress still want the statute to stand, even with this provision gone? Would Congress have still passed the same statute without it?" Feinstein responded saying that Barrett's definition was impressive. Share this -







Democrats announce witnesses for Thursday hearings Senate Judiciary Democrats announced their outside witnesses for the last day of the hearings on Thursday. Democrats and Republicans on the committee both invited witnesses. The Democrats’ witnesses are a mix of experts and real people who will tell their stories surrounding healthcare and abortion rights. According to a Democratic Judiciary committee aide, the Democrats will focus on health care, reproductive rights and voting rights. Barrett will not be in attendance. Share this -







FACT CHECK: Barrett says polygamy is illegal in 'many places.' It's illegal everywhere. In answer to Lindsey Graham’s questions about polygamy, Barrett said “Polygamy, obviously, in many places is still illegal.” In fact, polygamy is illegal in every state. Utah recently changed its law to downgrade the nature of the offense, but it’s still illegal there. Share this -







Barrett says laws to protect integrity of the ballot box can be subject to litigation Graham asked Barrett if it's appropriate for legislative bodies to protect the integrity of the ballot box. She said that "any specific measures that legislative bodies took to protect the integrity of the ballot box could be subject to litigation, subject to challenge." One of the reasons, Graham said, that Republicans have not reached an agreement with House Democrats on a Covid-19 relief package is because, he claimed, "they're mandating ballot harvesting as a national policy" — a reference to proposed measures on mail-in ballots. "I think it's ripe for fraud," he said. "We've seen evidence of ballots being placed in people's cars and dropped in ditches. So I think there will be an effort I hope to protect the integrity of the ballot, and also ensure easy voting." Democrats have wanted to expand access to voting during the pandemic by expanding mail-in ballot opportunities. Share this -







Graham says Democrats have made Barrett hearings all about 'Obamacare' Graham said that Democrats have made the Barrett confirmation hearings about the threat to the future of "Obamacare." "Obamacare is on the ballot. If you want socialized, single-payer health care, that’s on the ballot," Graham said. Democrats fear that Barrett would vote with conservative justices on the Supreme Court to strike down the health care law in an upcoming case that the court will hear Nov. 10. Share this -







Graham launches into 2nd round of questions by criticizing Harris for questioning Barrett's candidness Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, started his 20-minute round of questioning by criticizing Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., for suggesting that Barrett was not candid in her answers Tuesday. "I couldn't disagree more," Graham told Barrett on Wednesday as senators began the second round of questioning. "This hearing, to me, is an opportunity to not punch through a glass ceiling but a reinforced concrete barrier around conservative women," he said. "You're going to shatter that barrier. I have never been more proud of a nominee than I am of you. You've been candid to this body about who you are, what you believe." Share this -







ANALYSIS: Barrett reveals formula for reversing landmark rulings With the help of senators of both parties, Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett laid out a roadmap for overturning the Roe vs. Wade ruling protecting abortion rights and the Brown vs. Board of Education decision outlawing school segregation. Barrett declined to say Tuesday how she would rule on any future cases, including those involving abortion, racial discrimination, voting rights and the Affordable Care Act. But she did articulate clear views on the relative susceptibility of Roe and Brown to reversal. She observed that Brown is only settled so long as no one sues the government — federal, state or local — for segregating schools. And she said that Roe, because it is the subject of more controversy, is more open to being thrown out. Read more here. Share this -

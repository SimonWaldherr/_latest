class="mol-para-with-font">Later, Ms Sturgeon said he was simply trying to he honest with people about the hard decisions that faced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What he is trying to do is be frank with people about the reality we live in and not prematurely rule things out but equally not try to give people false assurances,' she said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I want us to be able to celebrate Christmas as normally as it is possible to do within the context of a global pandemic. And my message to people is that the more we all stick with these really difficult restrictions right now, the more chance there will be of us doing that.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Details of the new tier system are due to be spelled out tomorrow, with the highest bracket potentially condemning large areas to a March-style squeeze. It will raise concerns that England could end up in a similar position, as has often happened during the previous phases of the crisis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But pubs, restaurants and retailers are already voicing alarm they face a catastrophic winter, with dire predictions that two-thirds of hospitality firms could close.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The licensed trade said businesses had been kept 'completely in the dark' about the fresh wave of regulations, and warned the sector was 'staring into the abyss', with thousands of jobs at risk.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing in today's Daily Mail, Stephen Montgormery, from the&#160;Scottish Hospitality Group, said: 'Yesterday the Scottish Government effectively called last orders on our country's hospitality industry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hundreds of viable businesses now face closure, affecting the livelihoods of thousands of people.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Time and time again we have called on the Government to work with us on a solution.&#160;Time and time again we have faced a closed door.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next few days will be critical.

Will we be placed into the highest tier when the new system comes in?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is expected that no areas will initially be placed into the top, fifth tier under current proposals. Instead, areas under the toughest restrictions at present will likely be placed in the fourth tier when the system comes into force on November 2. This could involve a continuation of current restrictions, such as the closure of licensed premises.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our children missed a lot of school towards the end of the last academic year because of the Covid-19 lockdown. Could schools close again?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nicola Sturgeon has said her 'default' position is to keep schools open through any future lockdown and has highlighted other countries which kept the education system going, even during full lockdown. Under the new tier system, schools should not automatically close, even if the local area enters the top alert level. It's thought a 'judgment' will be made on a case-by-case basis over whether pupils would be sent home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Are there any tiers that would see life go back to normal?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, under tier zero, it is expected that life would resemble pre-pandemic normality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Will the tiers be implemented at health board or local authority level?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is thought restrictions will be set by council area, rather than health board, as is the case with current restrictions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What will be the rules for areas in the highest tier?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those living in an area placed under top tier restrictions would experience limitations almost as severe as the full lockdown imposed across the UK in March, when people were told to 'stay at home' and there were strict limits on travel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What will the three middle tiers involve?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are said to 'broadly mirror' the English system. The 'rule of six' is expected to apply in the second tier, meaning people can only socialise indoors or outdoors in groups of six adults from a maximum of two households. The rule will apply to pubs and restaurants, where customers will also be required to wear face coverings indoors when they are not eating and drinking. The next tier will reportedly see Scots prohibited from socialising in any indoor setting with people from outside their household or extended household. The rule of six continues to apply for socialising outdoors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the fourth tier, it is expected that people will be prohibited from socialising indoors or outdoors with anybody they do not live with, or with whom they have not formed an extended household.</p> <p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_1"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, warned: 'Hundreds of businesses are facing permanent closure and with that thousands of jobs will be lost &#8211; the damage could be irreparable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We estimate that two-thirds of hospitality businesses could be mothballed or go under in the coming months. Over 50 per cent of jobs in the pub and bar sector could also be lost.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The First Minister also refused to rule out school closures in badly affected areas, saying 'blended learning' could be reintroduced under extreme circumstances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don Lawson, owner of the Inverness bar Johnny Foxes, told the Press and Journal that the Government should ban alcohol sales in supermarkets and off-licences to save pubs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'Pubs are facing an unprecedented crisis and the jobs and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people are in jeopardy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Many of our beloved pubs are at real risk, with significantly reduced trade and increased costs as a result of questionable restrictions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I feel the answer to the hospitality conundrum is as follows, that the Scottish Government bans all alcohol sales in supermarkets and off-licenses, including off-sales in pubs and restaurants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Allow the sale of alcohol to be restricted to pubs and restaurants &#8211; this will boost local economies and safeguard thousands of jobs.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reacting to the proposal, Stuart McPhee, the director of Siberia Aberdeen and spokesman for the Aberdeen Hospitality Group, said: 'I'm all for trialling anything. It's as radical an idea as any.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've certainly advocated a few ideas such as shutting down premises who are not following the rules.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We need to be working as an industry alongside the Scottish Government to find a solution, given that we're the third-biggest employer in the country.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It came as Scotland recorded its deadliest day since May, with 28 deaths linked to Covid-19 registered in 24 hours.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A further 1,739 people tested positive, with 49 patients admitted to hospital. There are now 73 people in intensive care units across the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new five-tier system is due to be rolled out on November 2.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Sturgeon has said current restrictions on pubs and restaurants will remain in place until then.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has already indicated that the three middle tiers will be broadly similar to the new system in England &#8211; where areas are classed as being at either 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there will also be a lower level in Scotland for areas with fewer cases of Covid-19, and clinical director Prof Jason Leitch indicated travel restrictions will be put in place to prevent people from higher tiers moving into these.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In areas in the lowest tier, he said people will have 'slightly more freedoms than other parts of the country'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In contrast, Professor Leitch said areas in the highest tier would be under a 'fuller' lockdown, though schools would remain 'as open as possible'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new system is not expected to come into place until November 2, replacing temporary restrictions on the hospitality sector which were on Wednesday extended for another week up to that date.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme today, Professor Leitch said work is under way by advisers on what levels should be applied in different areas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'We will give advice and then the decision makers will make those choices over the weekend and into next week.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He explained a five-tier system is preferred in Scotland over the three levels in England because 'we think as advisers you have to have everything in your toolbox'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'You have to have the lower end, because if you were an area of Scotland with very low prevalence&#8230; then you could perhaps have slightly more freedoms than other parts of the country.</p><p class="vjs-video-container vjs-fixed vjs-span-two-col news" id="v-7729953471931171705">    </p> <img id="i-f31014df00a49e1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="634" alt="Shoppers walk yesterday along Princes Street, which is the main shopping area in Edinburgh" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f31014df00a49e1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/22/08/34696550-0-image-a-1_1603350653317.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Shoppers walk yesterday along Princes Street, which is the main shopping area in Edinburgh" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Shoppers walk yesterday along Princes Street, which is the main shopping area in Edinburgh</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Then there's the middle ones&#8230;

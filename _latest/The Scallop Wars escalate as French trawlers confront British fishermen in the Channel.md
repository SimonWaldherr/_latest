Scallop wars have broken out again in the English Channel after French trawlers confronted British fishermen by firing flares and throwing frying pans.

Two British boats, the Girl Macey, skippered by Scott Glover, and the Golden Promise, by Brian Whittington, were involved in the confrontation in the early hours of Monday morning.

They were surrounded by around 20 French vessels and were pelted by objects including frying pans and rocks. The hostile French crews even threw oil at the Gal Macey before firing a flare at the ship.

The outbreak of violence has sparked fears that hostilities are worsening and a death is inevitable.

Brian 'Winkle' Whittington, 43, skipper of the Golden Promise, said: "I was expecting it this time, they only do it in the dark.

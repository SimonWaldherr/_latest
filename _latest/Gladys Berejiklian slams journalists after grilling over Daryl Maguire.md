Gladys Berejiklian snapped at reporters on Wednesday as she faced a third grilling over her secret relationship with disgraced MP Daryl Maguire.

The premier, who is facing a vote of no confidence in parliament, again insisted that she has done nothing wrong and never witnessed any wrongdoing.

She said reporters were 'drawing dots which simply don't exist' and that she was offended by allegations that she was aware of any corruption.

'I will not have innuendo, incorrect statements put to me which I have found offensive, but in due course I have accepted to answer everything because it is in the public interest for the public to have confidence in me,' she said.

As she thanked her voters for their support, the premier was interrupted by a journalist and fired back: 'Excuse me, let me finish. I've given you your turn, let me finish. Ok?'

She then continued: 'I know the people of this state know that I have done nothing wrong, I appreciate the questions you all need to ask and I've answered them in full detail, but you also have to respect my position as premier and let me do my job.'

Mr Maguire, who resigned as Wagga Wagga MP in 2018, is accused of misusing his public office to broker property deals in western Sydney that would financially benefit him.

Australia was shocked on Monday when a corruption inquiry heard the father of two, 61, had a 'close personal relationship' with the 50-year-old premier from 2015 to August 2020.

Ms Berejiklian managed to keep the relationship secret from her family, friends and the public until phone recordings played at the inquiry revealed he called her 'babe' and she called him her 'numero uno' - Spanish for number one.

One message from 2014, before Ms Berejiklian was premier, appears to reveal Maguire telling Mr Berejiklian about how a motel had sold for $5.8 million, and how he was entitled to $5,000

She is now under pressure to resign, accused of turning a blind eye to corruption, after the calls also revealed that Mr Maguire discussed his property deals with her.

In one conversation in September 2017 Mr Maguire said he had done a property deal at Badgerys Creek in western Sydney that would help pay off large debts incurred by divorcing his ex-wife Maureen.

'We've done our deal so hopefully that's about half of all that gone now,' he said before the premier replied: 'I don't need to know about that bit.'

Concerns have been raised about whether the premier's secret relationship put her at risk of being targeted by Chinese intelligence, after a picture emerged of her and Mr Maguire meeting President Xi Jinping together in 2014.

On Wednesday, Ms Berejiklian dismissed those concerns, saying: Oh, my goodness... that's complete rubbish. As the Premier of state, I pass security clearances that nobody else has to pass.'

Labor leader Jodi McKay has moved a motion of no confidence against the premier in parliament.

'She turned a blind eye to corruption in her government by failing to report her knowledge of Daryl Maguire's business dealings for six and a half years,' Ms McKay said.

The vote is likely to fail because the government has a majority in the lower house.

On Wednesday Mr Maguire admitted in the Independent Commission Against Corruption hearing that he 'partly' turned his Macquarie St office over to the firm G8way Interational.

The company is described as an intermediary between China and Australia which 'ultimately' sold access 'to the highest levels of government'.

Mr Maguire told the inquiry he secretly acted as a director of the business which had interests in milk powder, a coal mine, a gold mine, cotton, wine, steel and a showroom in Shenzen, China.

He admitted receiving as many as 20 deliveries of thousands of dollars of cash at his parliamentary office for a scheme that helped Chinese nationals get Australian visas.

He also admitted keeping the money 'off the books' so he wouldn't have to disclose it to Parliament.

The ICAC inquiry previously heard that Mr Maguire introduced two Australian businessmen to the scheme that saw them get paid to employ Chinese nationals on a rural regional business visa without them having to turn up for work.

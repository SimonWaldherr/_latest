Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) asked a series of questions to rebut suggestions from Democrats that Barrett’s personal opposition to abortion would influence her decisions if she is confirmed to the Supreme Court. Lee highlighted Barrett’s role as an appeals court judge in upholding a Chicago law that established a buffer area around abortion clinics.

The Chicago law, upheld by a conservative three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, prohibits protesters from coming within eight feet of individuals to demonstrate or hand out leaflets outside clinics and other medical facilities.

“You followed that precedent, and you did so as a jurist rather than following whatever personal predilection might have otherwise guided you or any other member of the panel,” Lee said.

Barrett said the panel was bound by previous Supreme Court decisions. But the opinion she joined also critiqued the high court’s prior opinion saying it was “incompatible with current First Amendment doctrine.”

Lee also pointed to Barrett’s dissent from a ruling that blocked an Indiana law requiring that abortion providers bury or cremate fetal remains. The Supreme Court subsequently agreed with Barrett’s position in a 7-to-2 ruling that reinstated the fetal remains law.

A decision that “garners a majority of 7-to-2 these days on the Supreme Court, a decision that includes Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan does not seem radical to me,” Lee said.

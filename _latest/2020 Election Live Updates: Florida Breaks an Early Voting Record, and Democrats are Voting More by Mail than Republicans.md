Biden Jr., has outpaced him in fund-raising. In just over a year, Mr. Biden&#8217;s online fund-raising has increased 1,000-fold, to $24.1 million on Sept. 30. At the same time, the Trump campaign <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-campaign-fundraising.html" title="">is reining in its budget</a>.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jenny-gross" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid4-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-memphis-poll-worker-was-fired-for-turning-away-voters-wearing-black-lives-matter-shirts"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-memphis-poll-worker-was-fired-for-turning-away-voters-wearing-black-lives-matter-shirts">A Memphis poll worker was fired for turning away voters wearing &#8216;Black Lives Matter&#8217; shirts.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20elections-briefing-blm/merlin_177596250_49385b2e-f49d-411c-b210-b0a6ff87c621-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Xavier Burrell for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A poll worker in Memphis was fired last week after he improperly turned away several voters wearing T-shirts that said &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; and &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Breathe,&#8221; a local election official said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The official, Suzanne Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Shelby County Election Commission, said in an interview Monday night that although Tennessee law prohibited voters from wearing clothing with the names of active candidates or political parties, the rule did not apply to social justice expressions. The voters should have been allowed to cast their ballots, she said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Frankly, we were horrified when we learned that,&#8221; Ms. Thompson said. &#8220;So we took immediate action. No one should ever be turned away from a polling location.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Each state creates its own laws about political campaigning at polling places. Several states ban buttons and signs, while others go further and regulate dress codes.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Some states forbid mentions of specific candidates, while others disallow any statements on political issues. Voters who violate state law could be turned away, and on rare occasions people <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Electioneering-violation-leads-to-arrest-10418085.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been arrested</a> after refusing poll workers&#8217; instructions to cover up. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electioneering.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Find the laws in your state here</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In 2018, the Supreme Court <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/politics/supreme-court-minnesota-polling-places-politics.html" title="">struck down a Minnesota law</a> that prohibited political statements on apparel, even on broad issues like gun rights or labor unions. In a cautious 7-to-2 decision, the court acknowledged the value of decorum and solemn deliberation as voters prepare to cast their ballots. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that Minnesota&#8217;s law was not &#8220;capable of reasoned application.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The court found that the Minnesota law was too difficult to parse, for example by allowing a rainbow T-shirt unless a gay rights issue was on the ballot.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The ruling allowed states to enforce more narrowly written restrictions.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/daniel-victor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Daniel Victor</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="colorado-is-fighting-back-against-election-misinformation"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#colorado-is-fighting-back-against-election-misinformation">Colorado is fighting back against election misinformation.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Jena Griswold, Colorado&#8217;s secretary of state, speaking at a news conference last week about the state&#8217;s efforts to protect the process of casting a vote." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/world/20elections-briefing-disinfo-1/merlin_178684749_679c9e1a-77f9-478f-bbbc-32d90c7484b0-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Jena Griswold, Colorado&#8217;s secretary of state, speaking at a news conference last week about the state&#8217;s efforts to protect the process of casting a vote.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>David Zalubowski/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Bracing for a deluge of misinformation as Election Day draws closer, Colorado is stepping up its initiative to prevent deceptive tweets, doctored videos and other forms of false material from undermining elections in the state.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The effort, expanding on an operation set up this year within the office of Jena Griswold, Colorado&#8217;s secretary of state, will also run ads on social media and expand digital outreach to help voters identify foreign misinformation.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Griswold hired Nathan Blumenthal, a former counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security, to run the three-person operation, which in turn has hired outside vendors to help identify misinformation online, whether it is going viral on social media or lurking on obscure message boards.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The office will also buy Google ads against relevant search terms whenever a piece of misinformation begins to gain attention in an effort to slow its spread. For example, if someone were to claim Colorado&#8217;s ballots were lost in a fire, the office could buy ads linked to searches for &#8220;Colorado ballot fire&#8221; and get the top results, with the ads providing real information. And it is kicking off a public awareness campaign using Facebook ads that will direct voters to check the secretary&#8217;s website, using the tagline &#8220;Opinions are fun, facts are better.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Many states have not set up operations to combat misinformation, partly because their election offices are already so overworked and underfunded.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While major social media platforms have repeatedly pledged to crack down on the spread of false information, Ms. Griswold faulted both the federal and corporate responses to the problem.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Absolutely not enough is being done,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have a lack of leadership in the White House and the Senate. We have good pieces of legislation just sitting in the queues that have not been moved forward.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nick-corasaniti" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Nick Corasaniti</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/davey-alba" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p></p></div>

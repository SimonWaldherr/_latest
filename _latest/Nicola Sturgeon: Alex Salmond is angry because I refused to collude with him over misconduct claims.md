Nicola Sturgeon's war with Alex Salmond has escalated dramatically after she claimed he is angry with her because she refused to “collude” with him to make sexual harassment claims “go away”.

In an extraordinary attack on her mentor and predecessor, the First Minister suggested that Mr Salmond had wanted her help in covering up the claims when they first surfaced in 2018.

But she said the "root" of his fury with her is "that I didn't cover it up" and she accused him of trying to shift public attention away from his behaviour with claims "there was a big conspiracy against him."

Although he was cleared of all charges during his criminal trial earlier this year, Ms Sturgeon said concerns were raised "that suggest he didn't always behave in this respect as he should have done."

Referring to questions about her own behaviour, she said: "This is age-old here, that a man is accused of misconduct against women and often it’s a woman who ends up answering for them."

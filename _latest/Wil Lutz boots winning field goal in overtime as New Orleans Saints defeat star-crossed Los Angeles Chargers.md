NEW ORLEANS — The Saints looked dead, came back to life, relapsed, then revived again to win it in overtime, 30-27, over the Los Angeles Chargers at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on Monday night.

Wil Lutz kicked a 36-yard field goal with 5:08 to go in the overtime for the lead, and the Saints' defense held. On fourth-and-six from the Chargers' 44-yard line, Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert completed a pass to wide receiver K.J. Hill, but he was tackled a short of the first down by Saints' cornerback Marshon Lattiomore.

And it was over. The Saints had won their second straight game.

It was Lattimore who gave up back-to-back completions to wide receiver Jalen Guyton for 49 yards and to Williams for a 4-yard touchdown from Herbert that put the Chargers up 13-3 with 11:01 to go in the second quarter. The Chargers then went up 20-3 seven minutes later.

The come-from-behind win put New Orleans in a three-way tie for first in the NFC South at 3-2 with Tampa Bay and Carolina. The Chargers blew the 17-point lead in the second quarter to fall to 1-4.

Los Angeles could have won it in regulation, but Michael Badgley missed a 50-yard field goal as time expired, sending the game into overtime at 27-27. Badgley also missed an extra point after the Chargers took a 6-0 lead in the first quarter.

"It was a dirty, dirty game," said Saints running back Alvin Kamara, who caught eight passes for 74 yards and rushed 11 times for 45 yards. "We had to claw and scratch to come out on top."

The Saints won the toss before overtime, and quarterback Drew Brees drove his team 48 yards in nine plays to set up the Lutz field goal. Brees completed 33 of 47 passes for 325 yards and a touchdown for the game. At the half, he was only 12 of 22 for 93 yards with an interception as the Saints trailed 20-10.

This may have been because he was without wide receiver Michael Thomas, who was expected to play and practiced all week. But he was suspended after getting into a fight with teammate C.J. Gardner-Johnson. Brees' and Coach Sean Payton's game plan could have been impacted by this.

"We'll talk about the players that played," Payton said simply.

That would be wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, who caught a career-high 12 passes for 122 yards.

"We fought back," Payton said.

After the Saints came back from the 17-point deficit in the second quarter to tie it 20-20 in the fourth, Herbert found wide receiver Mike Williams all alone for a 64-yard touchdown and 27-20 lead with 3:40 to play in the game. And things looked bad for New Orleans again.

But Brees took the Saints right back with a 64-yard drive in seven plays to the Chargers’ 9-yard line, where Taysom Hill replaced him and kept for 9-yard touchdown to tie it at 27 with 52 seconds left. Brees hit running back Alvin Kamara down the sideline on a 28-yard completion to the Chargers’ 15 to set up the touchdown.

The Saints completed the erasure of a 20-3 second quarter deficit on an impressive, 89-yard drive in 10 plays over the end of the third quarter and early fourth quarter to tie it 20-20 at the 11-minute mark of the final period.

Brees was 5 of 5 on the drive for 84 yards and threw perfectly to wide open tight end Jared Cook from 41 yards out for the touchdown. The Saints overcame a first and 20 from their 38-yard line after a holding penalty.

Lutz kicked a 53-yard field goal with 4:52 to play in the third quarter to get the Saints within 20-13. Brees completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders to get that 40-yard drive going, then found Sanders again for 12 yards shortly before the drive stalled.

Brees completed 12 of his first 13 passes in the second half for 93 yards with an interception. He completed four straight passes for 45 yards to get the Saints to a first and goal at the Chargers’ 6-yard line with 21 seconds to go before halftime. Brees found Sanders for an apparent 6-yard touchdown on the next play, but Sanders was ruled down inside the 1-yard line after review.

After an incomplete pass, Brees jumped over the goal line on third and goal to get New Orleans within 20-10 with 14 seconds remaining before the half.

The Chargers took 20-3 lead with 4:25 left in the second quarter on a 3-yard touchdown pass from Justin Herbert to tight end Hunter Henry. That was two plays after Brees threw an interception to Los Angeles safety Nasir Adderley, who returned it 39 yards to the Saints’ 1-yard line.

WATCH:Mike Williams makes incredible catch for the Chargers

Los Angeles drove 75 yards in seven plays to take a 13-3 lead with 11:01 to go in the second quarter on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Herbert to wide receiver Mike Williams. The Chargers took a 6-0 lead in the first quarter on Herbert’s 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan Allen, but Badgley missed the extra point in what turned out to be critical.

The Saints cut it to 6-3 on a 48-yard field goal by Lutz as time expired in the first quarter.

Three takeaways from 'MNF'

1. Drew Brees is not done yet: Late in the second quarter, Saints coach Sean Payton had to be considering replacing him in the second half. Or at least thinking about it. If not, he should have been. But Brees came alive in a two-minute drill to end the first half as he completed 4 of 5 passes for 45 yards, then scored from the 1-yard line to get New Orleans within 20-10. He finished the game superbly.

2. Saints are over .500: New Orleans won its second straight and stayed in a three-way tie for first place in the NFC South at 3-2 with Carolina and Tampa Bay.

3. Defense kept Saints in the game: While the Saints were down 20-3 and trying to get back in it, the defense allowed the offense to do so. Then in the end, the defense made one final stop for the victory.

Maybe they censored themselves.

Twitter suffered a major crash on Thursday evening — telling users “something went wrong” when they attempted to open their feeds.

For more than an hour, thousands of users reported experiencing issues sending tweets or refreshing their timelines.

Service appeared to have been at least partially restored for some accounts shortly after 7 p.m.

“We have no evidence this outage is caused by a security breach or hack. We’re currently investigating internal root causes and will share more soon,” the company said in a statement on its website at around 6:40 p.m.

The epic fail comes a day after the social media giant took the unprecedented measure of shutting down The Post’s primary page while claiming, without evidence, bombshell reports about Hunter Biden’s emails were in violation of its “hacked materials” policy.

Users began reporting problems with the platform at around 5 p.m., with more than 57,000 complaints logged by 5:51 p.m., according to DownDetector, a website that tracks such issues.

DownDetector’s outage map showed glitches with Twitter being reported across the globe, though mostly concentrated in the US.

Twitter’s API status site said at around 5:56 p.m. that it was “currently investigating this issue.”

“We know people are having trouble Tweeting and using Twitter,” Twitter spokewoman said in an email to The Post.

“We have no evidence of a security breach or hack, and we’re currently investigating internal causes. We’re working to fix this issue as quickly as possible. We’ll share more when we have it and Tweet from @TwitterSupport once we can – stay tuned.”

In February 2019, after Bafta awarded its highest honour to Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma at its film awards that year, it’s fair to say that Netflix was not winning any friends among the UK’s multiplex cinema operators. They were outraged that a film that had been made for a streaming platform, and had not played on their screens, had been deemed eligible for the Bafta awards and had gone on to win Best Film.

Tim Richards, founder and CEO of the Vue cinema chain, set the tone with a public broadside: "We believe that BAFTA has not lived up to its usual high standards this year in choosing to endorse and promote a ‘made for TV’ film," he said.

Cineworld quickly followed by ending collaboration with Bafta – the organisation’s members would no longer have the privilege of being able to see films for free at its venues.

At that moment, Netflix was cast as the enemy of cinema operators – a deep-pocketed global giant that was able to bankroll prestige titles and offer them on its subscription platform. Yes, select films would be available to cinemas, especially during the run-up to awards season, but Netflix certainly wouldn’t be respecting the 16-week window of theatrical exclusivity that these operators expect and demand. Instead, it seemed to present cinemas with an existential threat.

Today, multiplex operators would be embarrassed to admit it, but the ground has dramatically shifted. Thanks to Covid-19 and the distancing measures that have followed, the major studios have laid waste to the release calendar, successively shifting major tentpole releases out of 2020 and into 2021. Universal’s postponement last week of Bond movie No Time To Die until next April is merely the highest profile example of that phenomenon, and UK and Ireland cinemas are currently operating at about 20 per cent of average 2019 box office levels.

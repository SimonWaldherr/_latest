SAVE OVER £20: A three-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited is free for Prime members until Oct. 14.

Amazon's Prime Day is fast approaching, and early deals have already started to drop. The latest deal is particularly impressive, as you don't need to spend a penny.

Prime members can get access to Kindle Unlimited for three months with no additional charge if they subscribe before midnight on Oct. 14. Yep, that's right. A three-month subscription for free.

This impressive offer only applies for new Kindle members. Kindle Unlimited provides access to over 1 million titles, audiobooks, comics, and selected magazine subscriptions. Prime members who then spend £15 on Kindle Books between Oct. 1 and Oct. 12 will also be entitled to a £5 Kindle Book credit to spend on any eligible Kindle Book within 30 days.

There is still a chance to save if you are already a Kindle member. Existing members can get three months of Kindle Unlimited for the price of one until Oct. 31. Both of these subscriptions will automatically renew at the full price after the promotional period, but you can cancel at anytime. Just don't forget about the renewal date.

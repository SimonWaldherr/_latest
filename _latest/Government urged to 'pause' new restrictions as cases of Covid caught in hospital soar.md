Imposing more new coronavirus restrictions would be "too hasty", scientists have said after figures revealed that up to a quarter of patients currently in hospital with Covid-19 caught the virus after being admitted.

Leading statisticians called on the Government to "pause", having shown that a significant proportion of the escalating hospital case total is down to poor Covid security within trusts.

Across England as a whole, 18 per cent of patients in hospital with Covid-19 tested positive for the virus for the first time seven days or more after admission. The proportion was highest – at 24 per cent – in the North-West, which is under imminent threat of further lockdown measures.

The rising number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients in the region was referred to by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, as he talked about possible new restrictions this week.

It comes amid growing concerns that the NHS has failed to learn lessons from the first wave of the pandemic about high levels of transmission within hospitals.

The percentage of probably healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) appears to be as bad, if not worse, than that recorded during the height of the first wave. This is despite an order from Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, for hospitals to improve their Covid security in June.

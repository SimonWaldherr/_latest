The things people do when they're drunk are not at all worth posting on Facebook.

But Yutthaphum Kaewekhem aka Boom is an exception.

The Thai national was recently out having dinner with his friend on October 2, 2020 at a mookata restaurant when he had one too many drinks.

In videos posted on his Facebook profile, Boom's friend recorded him attempting to abduct a random stray dog he had seen on the street.

He was recorded trying many times to put the dog in the car, only for the canine to casually jump out.

In his post, Boom wrote, "My friend does not know how to stop me. This is the restaurant in front of the village. Instead of stopping me, my friend recorded the videos ﻿before driving us home."

The following day, his friend records his reaction when he wakes up to discover that he had brought in a stray dog.

In the video, the confused dog can be seen sniffing around his new environment.

Feeling bad, Boom decided to return to the restaurant to leave the dog from where he had found it but had a change of heart. I mean, how can you say no to such a cute fella?

Boom and his canine buddy are now the best of friends. The Thai national even got his dog a collar, some food, and got it medically examined at a veterinarian.

Here's to more happy times (and drinks), Boom and dog!

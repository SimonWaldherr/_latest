 <p>     </p> <p>&#8220;There was hay in the corner on the floor, and to me what looked like rabbit droppings to be honest. It was all over the place.</p> <p>&#8220;Empty bottles empty cans. Food cartons all over the floor.&#8221;</p> <p>However worse was to come as Rebecca approached the unmade bed and claims she found blood smeared all over the sheets.</p> <p>She said: &#8220;I went into the bathroom and opened the door slowly because I thought oh my god, is there going to be somebody in here?</p> <p>&#8220;The bath was full to the brim with water and there was more hay in the corner and what looked to me like rabbit droppings.</p>

 <p>&#8220;It was awful, absolutely awful.&#8221;</p> <p>Horrified ECHO readers believe they have discovered the reason behind the state of the room with some saying that a person must have stayed there with a rabbit.</p> <p>On <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>, a number of people gave their reasons as to why they thought that.</p> <p>Anna Murray explained that rabbit urine could be a dark red or orange colour and it might not have been blood on the bed.</p> <p>She said: "Looks like someone had a rabbit living there.</p> <p>"The 'blood' on the bed actually looks like rabbit urine.</p> <p>"It is an orange/red colour.."</p> <p>Robyn Quirk also said: "It looks like someone was living there with a rabbit.</p>

   <p>"Rabbit urine can be red/orange if they have too many greens.</p> <p>"Still not acceptable at all. Where&#8217;s the rabbit?"</p> <p>When Rebecca told staff about the state of the room she was offered an apology and upgraded to another room.</p> <p>Rebecca claims: &#8220;When I came back the guy who sorted the room for me said the manager had put something aside for you.</p> <p>&#8220;He then came back with this bottle of prosecco. I said, oh thanks.&#8221;</p> <p>Reluctant to stay any longer in the hotel but feeling stuck as she had already paid, Rebecca took her bottle of prosecco and went to her new room.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>She said: &#8220;Before I went to sleep I pushed a set of draws up against the door because I felt that nervous about it.&#8221;</p> <p>Adding: &#8220;I've never ever in my life come face to face with that. I mean, I've stayed in some dives in the past but that was beyond belief.</p> <p>&#8220;I can't actually believe that happened - I was shaking with the shock of it.&#8221;</p> <p>The ECHO approached Britannia, the owners of the Adelphi hotel, for comment but did not receive a reply ahead of publication.</p> <p>The Mirror Online has also approached Britannia for a comment.</p></div>

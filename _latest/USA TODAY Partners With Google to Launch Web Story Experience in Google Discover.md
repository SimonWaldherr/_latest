USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY is partnering with Google to launch Web Story experience in Google Discover.

Google today announced a dedicated Web Story carousel with Discover, and USA TODAY is working with Google as one of the premier publishers to feature the new product.

The Web Stories format is an innovative and engaging way to both create and consume content on the open web. Notably, unlike other storytelling platforms where stories only live for 24 hours, Web Stories do not disappear after 24 hours.

USA TODAY published its first Web Story, which showed the destruction and devastation one year after Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano erupted, in 2019 and now regularly uses Web Stories on a range of newsworthy and timely topics.

USA TODAY recently used the format for a news story on why mail-in voting is so controversial and for one on systemic racism. Travel and lifestyle stories include BEST Road trips USA, Tips for decorating a cake, Old-school hobbies making a comeback and How to pick the best watermelon. In total, USA TODAY and other Gannett brands such as 10Best, Reviewed, and Golfweek have published nearly 600 Web Stories.

“The Web Stories storytelling format aligns with our goal of engaging news consumers on their mobile phone and helps us reach new audiences through Google Search and Discover. USA TODAY is known for high-quality visuals, so this platform allows us to highlight the strong of our photos, video, and graphics teams in the newsroom,” said Alexandra Ptachick, Audience Editor of Emerging Platforms at USA TODAY.

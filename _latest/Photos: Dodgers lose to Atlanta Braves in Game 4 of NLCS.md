The Dodgers’ World Series aspirations took a big hit Thursday with a 10-2 loss to the Atlanta Braves in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.

Trailing 3-1 in the series, the Dodgers will need to win the next three games, starting with Game 5 on Friday, to punch their ticket to the World Series.

</p><p>The head of <strong>Germany&#8217;s</strong> leading public health body has insisted it is still possible to control the spread of the coronavirus if people abide by basic rules such as social distancing and mask wearing.</p>
<p><strong>Lothar Wieler</strong> of the <strong>Robert Koch Institute</strong> said &#8220;we are not powerless&#8221;, arguing the most important measure people could take was to avoid private gatherings.</p>
<p>He said statistics gathered in Germany showed clearly that the majority of infections were taking place in private settings, especially parties, where the virus spread most effectively, when people were in close proximity to each other, and laughing and speaking, after which they then returned home and infected others in their respective households.</p>

 </p>
<p>Where people like to gather and share each other&#8217;s company, that is where the infection is being spread most. We see from studies how the aerosols spread more intensively the more people laugh and are happy, and the closer they are to each other.... private celebrations are the decisive point in this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of infections in Germany soared overnight to almost 11,300, a higher number than at any time in the pandemic. The rise on the previous day was around 7,600. So far, 9,911 people have died in the country.</p>
<p>Wieler said that contrary to reports, it was not the case that the rise was due to more testing being carried out; &#8220;The rate is rising, and in every age group.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said more than one million tests were being carried out in Germany every day, and the percentage of positive test results among them had risen from under 1% just weeks ago, to 3% now.</p>
<p>Wieler stressed the importance of track and tracing. He pointed to the &#8220;mistake&#8221; made by countries which he said had abandoned track and trace systems early on in the pandemic after being unable to cope with the task.</p>
<blockquote class="quoted">
<p class="inline-garnett-quote inline-icon ">


 </p>
<p>Some countries [Sweden, the UK] stopped their track and trace services because they couldn&#8217;t keep up. But we know that it is better to track and trace somewhat than not to track and trace at all, because quintessentially, every contact that you find, reduces the spread of the infection... [Those countries] gave up their contact tracing in the spring because they were overwhelmed. That proved not to be the right way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said that the RKI did not support so-called &#8216;circuit breakers&#8217; to interrupt the spread of the virus. </p>
<blockquote class="quoted">
<p class="inline-garnett-quote inline-icon ">


 </p>
<p>It obviously depends on the local, epidemiological situation, but we don&#8217;t recommend that. Our advice is that we want people to keep a distance and to wear a face covering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wieler urged the public to continue to wear masks in shops, and spaces where people were gathered close together, as well as to air rooms regularly. He also encouraged people to keep a diary about where they had been, to assist tracking and tracing if they became infected.<br></p>

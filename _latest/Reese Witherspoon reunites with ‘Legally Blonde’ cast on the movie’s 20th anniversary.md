<div><p>There&#8217;s no arguing that &#8216;Elle Woods&#8217; has forever been etched in our minds as one of the most iconic pop culture characters. It has been almost 20 years since Reese Witherspoon first reprised the role of this young, fierce and intelligent woman, appearing in <i>Legally Blonde </i>on the big screen.</p>

<p>To celebrate this extremely special occasion, the entire cast of the movie decided to virtually come together in the form of a fundraiser; the money raised was donated to World Central Kitchen. Apart from Reese Witherspoon herself, Luke Wilson, Holland Taylor, Jennifer Coolidge, Selma Blair, Ali Larter, Alanna Ubach, Jessica Cauffiel and Matt Davis were all present on the video call. The reunion was moderated by SNL member Chloe Fineman.</p>

<p>Obviously, nostalgia was among the main subjects, and when questioned how Witherspoon felt about the impact &#8216;Elle Woods&#8217; had on young minds, the actress said, &#8220;None of us knew what this film was gonna turnout to be or how much it would inspire young women and young people across the world. I've traveled the entire world and the movie people always stop be about it Legally Blonde. And the thing that really touches my heart is people stop me and say "I went to law school because of Elle Woods,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Witherspoon also said that out of all the movies she has ever been a part of, <i>Legally Blonde </i>is the often, the most talked about film, because her character inspired people to believe in themselves.</p>

<p>This reunion is followed by news breaking a few weeks ago that <i>Legally Blonde 3</i> was officially greenlit. Screenwriter and actress Mindy Kaling will be writing this new project which comes 19 years after the first movie&#8217;s release. Reese Witherspoon will return as &#8216;Elle Woods&#8217; along with the original creative team; the actress has also been signed on as the co-producer.</p>

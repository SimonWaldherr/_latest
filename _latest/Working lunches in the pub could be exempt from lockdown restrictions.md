  Working lunches in the pub could be exempt from lockdown restrictions 
description: > 
  Working lunches could be exempt from Covid lockdown restrictions after an apparent “loophole” emerged.But last night No 10 and local authorities suggested that such meetings were permitted so long as they are for "work purposes".Government guidance stipulates that up to 30 people from different households may meet indoors for work purposes, as long as the place they are meeting is set up to follow Covid guidelines.Westminster council has pointed at least one business owner who asked about working lunches towards the exemption on the ban on indoor meetings if deemed necessary for work purposes.A Number 10 spokesman said that while current guidance advises people to limit their social contact and work from home as much as possible, “people are permitted to meet indoors for work purposes in high or very high areas”.

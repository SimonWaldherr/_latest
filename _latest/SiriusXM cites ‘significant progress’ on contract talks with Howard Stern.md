  SiriusXM cites ‘significant progress’ on contract talks with Howard Stern

  The boss of SiriusXM said the satellite-radio giant is “making significant progress” on a deal to extend Howard Stern’s contract.“Howard tells me he’s never been happier and our relationship with Howard has never been stronger,” outgoing Chief Executive Jim Meyer said on a Thursday earnings call with investors.Earlier this month, a Bloomberg report said Sirius was looking to fork over $120 million a year to keep Stern at the satellite radio station.“It sounded awesome.”Stern’s previous five-year contracts reportedly have paid him between $80 million and $100 million a year.Pandora, the company’s music streaming service, added 105,000 new paid subscribers, bringing its tally to 6.4 million.

<div><p>The boss of SiriusXM said the satellite-radio giant is &#8220;making significant progress&#8221; on a deal to extend Howard Stern&#8217;s contract.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howard tells me he&#8217;s never been happier and our relationship with Howard has never been stronger,&#8221; outgoing Chief Executive Jim Meyer said on a Thursday earnings call with investors. &#8220;From my perspective we are very far along. But it is never done until it&#8217;s done. I am very confident we have an agreement to announce soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 66-year-old shock jock&#8217;s current contract lapses at the end of 2020, and media watchers <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/08/01/howard-stern-could-land-major-payday-with-renewed-contract/?_ga=2.17816441.1136922573.1603115746-814661974.1571627530">have speculated</a> whether he will retire or defect to a rival service like Spotify, which has been on a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/07/howard-stern-comments-on-reported-120m-payday/">podcast spending spree</a> this year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a Bloomberg report said Sirius was looking to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/07/sirius-xm-reportedly-close-to-pricey-new-howard-stern-contract/">fork over $120 million</a> a year to keep Stern at the satellite radio station. Stern <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/07/howard-stern-comments-on-reported-120m-payday/">quickly shot that down</a> on his show, saying he hasn&#8217;t seen a new contract and that he and his agent were &#8220;kind of baffled&#8221; by the report.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to take that deal if I can get it,&#8221; the shock jock quipped on air. &#8220;It sounded awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stern&#8217;s previous five-year contracts reportedly have paid him between $80 million and $100 million a year.</p>
<p>Meyer, who will retire as CEO on Dec. 31 and become vice chairman of Sirius&#8217; board, pointed to recent headline-making deals with stars including Kevin Hart, LeBron James and Maverick Carter in a bid to assure analysts that Stern would remain at the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pat McAfee joined our sports lineup, and we returned to live sports across the MLB, NBA and NFL,&#8221; Meyer noted. &#8220;And we brought our listeners special moments like the recent interview between Paul McCartney and Alec Baldwin honoring John Lennon&#8217;s 80th birthday on The Beatles Channel.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the quarter ended Sept. 30, SiriusXM added 186,000 new subscribers, giving it 34.4 million total subscribers. Pandora, the company&#8217;s music streaming service, added 105,000 new paid subscribers, bringing its tally to 6.4 million.</p>
<p>Overall, third-quarter income edged up 11 percent to $272 million, or 6 cents a diluted share, as sales remained flat at just over $2 billion. Analysts expected EPS of 5 cents on revenue of $1.94 billion.</p>

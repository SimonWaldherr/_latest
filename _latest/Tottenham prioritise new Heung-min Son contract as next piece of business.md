<div><p>Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy will prioritise trying to tie Heung-min Son to a new contract once the dust settles on a busy window of transfer business.</p>
<p>Levy has been credited by some groups of fans as completing the most successful transfer window of his Spurs reign after re-signing Gareth Bale and bringing in a<a> host of new first-team players to boost Jose Mourinho&#8217;s squad.</a></p>
<p>Mourinho last week described Levy as a &#8220;genius&#8221; for his work in the transfer market and the next item on the top of Tottenham&#8217;s agenda is to reward Son for his fine form.</p>
<p>Son&#8217;s contract will have two years to run at the end of this season, which means there is no immediate rush to finalise an extension.</p>
<p>But Levy would ideally like an agreement in place before next summer to prevent the threat of any of Europe&#8217;s richest clubs being encouraged to make a bid for the South Korean.</p>
<p>Son has developed into one of the best forward players in the Premier League since signing from Bayer Leverkusen five years ago.</p>
<p>He has already registered seven Premier League goals this season and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/18/tottenham-vs-west-ham-premier-league-live-score-latest-gareth/">his partnership with Harry Kane has reached a new level under Mourinho.</a></p>
<p>Tottenham last extended the contract of Son two years ago and the 28-year-old can expect to be offered another significant rise to his &#163;110,000-a-week wages.</p>
<p>While there are no internal fears over Son&#8217;s future, Levy will not risk<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/01/24/tottenham-midfielder-christian-eriksen-verge-inter-milan-move/"> facing a Christian Eriksen situation with one of his star players again.</a></p>
<p>Eriksen eventually forced Tottenham into selling him to Inter Milan after entering the final 12 months of his contract and Levy will not want to risk being caught out again over a player he wants to keep or values highly.</p>
<p>Right-back Serge Aurier will only have a year remaining on his contract at the end of the season, but talks are yet to open over a new deal after he eventually stayed at the club this summer despite interest from AC Milan.</p>

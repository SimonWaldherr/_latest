<div><p><strong>In just under an hour, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will once again stand up in the House of Commons to announce further financial support measures.</strong></p>
<p>After a mixed reception for his Job Support Scheme, announced last month, the Chancellor is expected to outline a new set of measures designed to help pubs and restaurants caught in the Tier 2 virus restrictions that have been dubbed the &#8216;worst of both worlds&#8217;.</p>
<p>As my colleagues <strong>Harry Yorke</strong> and <strong>Gordon Rayner</strong> reported last night:</p>
<blockquote>
The Chancellor is understood to be working on a compensation package for thousands of businesses whose trade is restricted by Government regulations after they complained of being left in limbo without support.
<br>
<br> While firms such as pubs in Tier 3 that are forced to close by law can access business grants and the two-thirds wage subsidy, those in the next tier down cannot because the law does not force them to close.
<br>
<br> It means hospitality venues across large areas of the country in which the 10pm curfew remains in force and indoor mixing between households is banned can only access the less generous part-time subsidy, which still requires them to contribute 55 per cent of wages.&#160;

<p>Unlike with most of the Treasury&#8217;s recent pronouncements, there was no press briefing ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, so nobody&#8217;s certain what to expect.

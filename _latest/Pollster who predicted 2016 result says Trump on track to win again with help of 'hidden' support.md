  Pollster who predicted 2016 result says Trump on track to win again with help of 'hidden' support 
description: > 
  With two weeks left until Election Day, 35 million Americans having already voted, and most polls showing Joe Biden leading President Trump, Trafalgar Group chief pollster Robert Cahaly told “Hannity” Tuesday the incumbent is likely to be reelected.The Georgia-based Trafalgar Group drew national attention in 2016 as one of the few pollsters showing Trump leading in Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan on the eve of voting day.Trump swept all three states en route to his stunning win over Hillary Clinton.“What we’ve noticed is that these polls are predominantly missing the hidden Trump vote,” Cahaly explained.“And if that happens, well, then the mainstream media is going to have to cover it."

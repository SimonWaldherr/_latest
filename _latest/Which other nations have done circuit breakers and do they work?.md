The phrase “circuit breaker” is a gift for any pandemic fighting politician. It’s accessible and talks to precision and immediacy. ‘That dastardly virus. Have no fear, we’ll simply turn it off with a flick of our special circuit breaking switch.’

No wonder Nicola Sturgeon and Arlene Foster have already ordered them up for Scotland and Northern Ireland, and what a gift to the Labour leader Keir Starmer, who says he too would pull the magic lever if he were in charge.

Only with a circuit breaker can we avoid sleepwalking “into a long and bleak winter”, he says.

But beyond the spin, things are a little more complex. Singapore, South Korea and New Zealand have all successfully used so-called “circuit breakers” to cut viral transmission chains - yet none of these countries allowed the virus to spread widely in the first place.

Some also point to Israel, but in truth the country was forced into a second lockdown after getting carried away with its initial success, reopening too soon and encouraging Israelis to “enjoy yourselves” over summer as if all risk was alleviated.

Mr Starmer says he is just “following the science” and it is true that modelling presented to Sage predicts that a two-week circuit breaker – in which all householders were prevented from mixing and non-essentials business were closed – could reset the pandemic clock back by about a month.

  Bruce Springsteen, Letter to You, review: passionate, brilliant, and unashamedly old-fashioned 
description: > 
  “One minute you’re here, next minute you’re gone,” Bruce Springsteen croons on the pensive opening of his 20th album, Letter To You.One Minute You’re Here is a folky gem, as poignant as anything Springsteen has ever sung, his bruised vocals softened to match his acoustic guitar.Late last year, Springsteen summoned his long serving seven-piece band to his New Jersey home studio and recorded an entire album in just five days.“Rock of ages lift me up somehow,” Springsteen pleads on Last Man Standing, commemorating his first schoolboy band, The Castiles, of which he is the only surviving member.“I’m alive!” he roars with hair-raising conviction on Ghosts, whilst paying tribute to those the E Street Band have lost along the way: saxophonist Clarence Clemons and organist Danny Federici.

<div><p>&#8220;One minute you&#8217;re here, next minute you&#8217;re gone,&#8221; <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/bruce-springsteen-interview-spent-35-years-trying-let-go-destructive/">Bruce Springsteen</a> croons on the pensive opening of his 20th album, Letter To You. At 71, the veteran singer-songwriter seems in a reflective mood.</p>
<p>One Minute You&#8217;re Here is a folky gem, as poignant as anything Springsteen has ever sung, his bruised vocals softened to match his acoustic guitar. It is, perhaps, what you might expect from a grand old man of rock and roll, entering his seventh decade in trying times with a tender rumination on the fragility of life.</p>
<p>But then something rather wondrous happens as we roll on to the title song. With a dramatic wallop of snare drum smashes, a grand descending piano motif, a twisting howl of electric guitar and the high soaring flutter of a Hammond organ, the E Street Band announces itself in all its sinuous, spectacular glory. And Letter To You takes off like a rocket.</p>
<p>Late last year, Springsteen summoned his long serving seven-piece band to his New Jersey home studio and recorded an entire album in just five days. He had a set of songs dwelling on mortality, memory, loss, hope and faith, shot through with a vein of defiance, a conviction that music itself has the power to heal and restore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rock of ages lift me up somehow,&#8221; Springsteen pleads on Last Man Standing, commemorating his first schoolboy band, The Castiles, of which he is the only surviving member. &#8220;I&#8217;m alive!&#8221; he roars with hair-raising conviction on Ghosts, whilst paying tribute to those the E Street Band have lost along the way: saxophonist Clarence Clemons and organist Danny Federici.</p>

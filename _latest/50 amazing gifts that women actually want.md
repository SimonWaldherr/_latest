We love Lululemon's Align leggings at Reviewed. They are the most comfortable leggings I've ever owned. Even after numerous washes and years of ownership, they are still my favorite to wear for both workouts and lounging. In fact, I refuse to wear any leggings&#160;except Align leggings now. Pay attention to sizing, as you want to get the right pair for your giftee. For example, I am 5"2 and wear the crop 21" and 23" leggings as pants.</p><p class="partner-placement partner-spike"></p><p class="p-text">For a less pricey option,&#160;Nordstrom's fitness brand, Zella, carries leggings that we love for the value. Since I cannot afford to only own Lululemon's Align leggings, I own a few pairs of Zella leggings.&#160;While&#160;they are not as comfortable as the Aligns, they are great for the price. Not to mention, they have a 4.5-star rating from over 7,000 reviews, so people love them.</p><h3 class="presto-h3"><strong><strong>8.

But the Good Law Project is challenging the Government&#8217;s decision to award contracts to a few firms run by &#8220;allies&#8221; without a competitive tender. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves, who analysed the contracts, told the Mirror: &#8220;It is outrageous that so much public money is being siphoned to Tory friends and donors. We need to know who agreed these contracts, when and why.&#8221;</p> <p>Jo Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project, added: &#8220;The way government chose to place these contracts threw open the doors to the politically well connected. And boy, did they take advantage.</p> <p>&#8220;While tens of thousands of families mourn loved ones, in the Carlton Club the lucky few will be toasting the Government with vintage champagne, paid for with our money.&#8221;</p> <p>The Department of Health said: &#8220;We have processes for carrying out proper due diligence for all government contracts and we take these checks extremely seriously.&#8221;</p> <p>Here, we take a look at some of the contracts and their Tory links...</p> <h3>PA Consulting Services Ltd</h3> <p>&#163;13.75m</p> <p>Contracts - 3</p> <p>WHAT FOR: Consulting</p> <p>LINK:&#160;Tory ex-leader of Kensington and Chelsea council Sir Merrick Cockell has been a senior adviser since 2014. The bulk of the work was for consulting on the ventilator challenge. There is no suggestion Sir Merrick played any role in securing contracts with the Government.&#160;</p> <h3>Meller DesignsTotal </h3> <p>&#163;90.9million</p> <p>Contracts: 4</p> <p>WHAT FOR: Hand sanitiser, face masks</p> <p>LINK:&#160;Co-owner is David Meller, who has given Tories &#163;65,000 in 10 years.

The firm usually supplies home and beauty goods but turned to PPE. Mr Meller has said he is &#8220;proud&#8221; of its role at the height of the crisis.</p> <h3>Randox Laboratories Ltd</h3> <p>&#163;133m</p> <p>Contracts - 1</p> <p>WHAT FOR: <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">Coronavirus</a> testing</p> <p>LINK:&#160;Northern Irish firm pays former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson almost &#163;100,000 a year as an adviser. But a spokesman insisted: &#8220;Owen Paterson MP played no role in securing any Randox contract with DHSC and any insinuation that he did would be misleading.&#8221;&#160;</p>

 <p>Rachel Reeves, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Cabinet Office Minister, said: "This Government is obsessed. It cannot stop outsourcing.</p> <p>"Since the pandemic began, we have seen it issue &#163;11billion of contracts without competitive tender, meaning businesses that are experienced and qualified have been shut out.</p> <p>"Of course, it&#8217;s important the Government took swift initial action to the virus. But why hand out these contracts to a handful of huge companies, many of them with terrible track records?</p> <p>"Why rely on them without considering all the alternatives? Why, when we know how vital tracing contacts is in curbing the spread, hand the funds to Serco rather than local public health teams, as most successful countries have done?</p> <p>"The failures on contact tracing bite especially deep when we see many of our councils picking up the pieces with a fraction of the resources.</p> <p>"And what seems wasteful becomes troubling when we look closer at some of these contracts handed to people with clear links to the Tory Party.</p> <p>"These top &#163;1billion worth so far. This approach isn&#8217;t just shady it&#8217;s also not working, with tests voided, PPE unable to be used and a fortune spent on consultants doing who knows what.</p> <p>"This wasteful government needs to learn from our local leaders and put communities above its political pals."</p></div>

Tiffany Trump is not having a good week.

First she was called out online for celebrating her 27th birthday at multiple Miami hot spots without social distancing or wearing a mask.

And now the president’s daughter with Marla Maples suffered further indignity when her half-sister Ivanka tweeted a birthday message at her — but tagged a fake account with just over 700 followers by mistake.

Ivanka tweeted a sweet picture of herself carrying Tiffany when they were both children.

She wrote, “Happy birthday @tiffanytrump! Hope this year marks your best turn yet around the sun! Love you so much!”

Unfortunately, Tiffany’s real account is @TiffanyATrump.

Earlier in the week, anti-Trump social media platform Meidas Touch had posted a video accusing Tiffany of recklessly and lavishly celebrating her birthday amid the pandemic.

Tiffany also hosted a $25,000-a-head “dessert” reception for her father’s campaign at the Doral on Thursday.

<li>Deutsche Bank in a new note outlines the 5 forces driving the trend of localization, which will disadvantage large companies and favor small companies.</li>
<li>"Covid-19 has turbocharged the de-globalization movement as supply chains have been upended, geopolitical risk has risen, and ESG-conscious customers and investors have pushed companies to be more 'resilient' and local," said Deutsche Bank equity analyst, Luke Templeman in the October 19 research note.</li>
<li>Global foreign direct investment is one of the factors. The United Nations World Investment Report is predicting FDI will drop 40% this year, wiping out 15 years' of gains. Large companies are sensitive to foreign investment and this significant drop in FDI will impact profit margins.</li>
<li>"Given these trends are only at the beginning of unwinding decades of globalization, it appears this process has a long way to go," Templeman said. "That means that although the costs of localization may be great, particularly for large companies, the cost of not doing may be greater still."</li>

<p>Globalization creates a natural advantage for large companies that are positioned with headquarters around the world and global supply chains. However, in a new research note, Deutsche Bank believes there is a long-term trend toward localization and smaller companies will be better positioned to benefit from this shift.</p><p>"Covid-19 has turbocharged the deglobalization movement, as supply chains have been upended, geopolitical risk has risen, and ESG-conscious customers and investors have pushed companies to be more 'resilient' and local," Deutsche Bank equity analyst, Luke Templeman said in the October 19 note.</p><p>A localization business strategy is one where a product, or business model is adapted for a specific country, adjusting for cultural, political and legal differences.&#160;</p><p>Business localization is a trend that has been under discussion for some time. In 2012, the Boston Consulting Group said seven industries had already reached tipping points in their global cost structure, which meant localization was increasingly attractive. The industries included transportation goods, machinery as well as computers and electronics.</p><p>Yet, in 2018 only 35% of large companies had, or were implementing, localization practices, according to consulting firm AT Kearney.</p><p>COVID-19 has "turbocharged" the deglobalization movement and has forced companies to think more about localization both in Europe and the US. The following charts demonstrate how localization is increasingly being discussed in corporate documents.</p><p>

</p><p>Smaller companies are better positioned to manage the move to localization because they likely already have local sources for goods and labour and they are likely nimble enough to change operations and suppliers much quicker than large companies, Luke Templeman said.</p><p>Here are the five localization forces Deutsche Bank lists as disadvantaging large companies and favoring small ones.</p>

<h2>Global FDI</h2><p>The United Nations' World Investment Report is predicting that Foreign Direct Investment, a type of investment made by a company, or individual, from one country to another, will drop by 40% to 2005 levels of below $1 trillion.</p><p>This is a concerning sign as the profit margins of large companies are sensitive to foreign investment, Templeman said. When China joined the World Trade Organization, FDI increased and so did the margins of large companies relative to smaller companies. But when FDI decreased, so did the margins of large companies and smaller companies then had the advantage.</p><p>"Of course, many other factors have contributed to the difference in performance of large and small companies, but China's rise has been a key phenomenon over the last few decades," Templeman said.</p><p>The drop in FDI will affect companies margins. In addition, large companies with a single international supplier will likely see operational costs impacted in the short and medium term as investors push company management to diversify suppliers, Templeman said.</p><h2>A rise in Chinese wages</h2><p>The growth in FDI in China has resulted in significant investment in the country. This has also meant that the labor force in China is "highly utilized" and thus the benefits from sourcing labour from there has fallen, Templeman said.</p><p>Companies should expect wage growth in China to continue as the working-age population continues to decrease.</p><p>

</p><p>"Indeed, once energy costs are included, the cost of manufacturing is only five per cent below that in the US, according to BCG's cost-competitive index," Templeman said. "Countries that are cheaper than China (including energy costs) include Mexico, Ireland, India, Thailand, and Romania. Furthermore, countries such as Hungary and Poland are only slightly more expensive than China. Given their geographical proximity for European corporates, this makes for a compelling discussion."</p><h2>ESG Investing</h2><p>
      <img class="lazy-image " src="" alt="ESG issues in US and Europe from Deutsche Bank note">

</p><p>The report states that there has been a "sudden escalation" in ESG investors, with a particular focus on the supply chain and employee-related pandemic issues. ESG issues tend to affect large companies more, because are more likely to be targeted by large investors, who have the ability to demand change.</p>

<p>"Large companies are also far more likely to find themselves in the media for ESG-related reasons," Templeman said.</p><p>Many companies also now need to track their environmental impact. Smaller companies have an advantage because of the limited scale of their operations, which makes it easier to track and make changes. Large companies may struggle to track environmental impact due to the complexity of the global business model.</p><p>"For example, ESG investors are currently pushing large companies to disclose their 'Scope Three' emissions. This is extremely complex and involves a company understanding the carbon emissions generated at every level of their supply chain, including by outsourced providers," Templeman said.</p><h2>Politics</h2><p>There has been increasing discussion from both parties during the US election about local supply chains. Corporate tax rates continue to be a talking point and a rate hike will affect all companies, but will impact large ones more, Templeman said.</p><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development hopes to implement new tax rules within the next 12 months to remove the tax advantages for companies that shift between companies.</p><p>"Specifically, an increase in corporate tax rates will have an outsized impact on large companies that have arranged their operations to take advantage of low-tax domiciles," Templeman said.</p><p>While the shift toward populist political rhetoric has meant that there is a "political desire" to help support those who have been disadvantaged by globalization, Templeman said. He also notes the trend toward populism has several causes, but one is the desire for change shared by those who have been hurt by globalization.</p><h2>Customers</h2><p>
      <img class="lazy-image " src="" alt="Graph on customer habits from Deutsche Bank note">

</p><p>Customer habits are changing. They now prefer a product that has the feeling and "peer signaling ability" that is offered by smaller companies and cottage industries.</p>

<p>"Therefore, customers have moved from a mindset of 'I want to have that thing' to, 'everyone has that thing, I want something different'," Templeman said.</p><p>The shift in mindset presents advantages to smaller companies with local suppliers and that generate a community and independent focused feel compared to large companies that distribute standard products en masse.</p><h2><strong>What's next for large companies?</strong></h2><p>Not all hope is lost for large companies with the trend towards localization. Large companies with superior technology abilities will be able to use big data to their advantage in ways that smaller companies cannot.</p><p>Large companies that create an independent feel through their product lines and can create customized options will&#160; also have an edge. Templeman notes customers are now willing to wait for unique products to be delivered, which provides large companies with more opportunities to experiment.</p><p>"Consider that Diageo owns over two dozen Scotch whisky labels," Templeman said. "Many of these maintain a level of independence over their operations and have different styles, branding, target demographics, and fans. This strategy can obviously be successful; however, there is a fine line to walk as some customers actively seek out brands that are truly independent."</p><p>But the biggest advantage will be for the companies that have already started to prepare for a shift toward localization.</p><p>"Although it can be difficult to predict how the thoughts of these two groups will evolve, what seems certain is that the forces driving localization will continue to gather momentum," Templeman said. "That is because those forces come from both angles: top-down politics, and bottom-up customer preferences. Given these trends are only at the beginning of unwinding decades of globalization, it appears this process has a long way to go. That means that although the costs of localization may be great, particularly for large companies, the cost of not doing may be greater still."</p>

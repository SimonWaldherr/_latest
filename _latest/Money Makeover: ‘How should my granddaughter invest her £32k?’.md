<div><p>David Holmes, 75, from Kent, has been putting aside money for his five grandchildren for more than a decade. His eldest, Abi, has just turned 18 and can now access a pot worth about &#163;32,000 that Mr Holmes has been investing on her behalf.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funds were held within a junior investment account and invested in the Kames Ethical Equity fund, the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/funds/20-somethings-can-invest-amazon-netflix-tomorrow-fraction/"> Scottish Mortgage investment trust</a> and the Stewart Investors Worldwide Sustainability fund,&#8221; he said. Each year he transferred some of the money to a Junior Isa, which was put into a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/funds/invest-20000-windfall/">multi-manager fund</a>.</p>
<p>Abi, who will be taking her A-levels next summer, said she would like to<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/millennial-investorcan-stock-market-buy-house-within-10-years/"> invest the majority of the money to buy a house</a> in about five years&#8217; time. &#8220;I plan to go to university to study hospitality, events and tourism first and may put some of the money towards living costs,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>She is interested in using her investments to support the healthcare industry.</p>
<h3>Don Fraser of&#160;Capital Asset Management, a financial planner, said:</h3>
<p>Abi is likely to face <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/student-money/revealed-best-value-universities-britain/">living costs while at university</a> of &#163;9,540 a year, according to Savethestudent.org, a website. Over a three-year course, that&#8217;s almost &#163;29,000.</p>
<p>I do not recommend that Abi use her savings to cover this. She should apply for a maintenance loan because, even though interest will be charged on any money borrowed, she<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/student-money/how-repay-student-loan-when-wiped-questions-university-finance/"> may not ever have to pay it back</a>. She will only begin repaying once she earns over a set amount (currently &#163;26,575 before tax in England and Wales). The loan is cancelled after 30&#160;years.</p>
<p>The average gap between maintenance payments and living costs is &#163;2,676 a year. To fill this, Abi could use her investments, apply for a grant, use an interest-free student overdraft, ask her parents for help or get a job.</p>
<p>If she kept her money invested and earned 5pc a year after fees, in five years it would have grown to &#163;41,067. By using some of her money to cover her remaining living costs of &#163;2,676 for three years (&#163;8,028) and leaving the rest invested, Abi would have &#163;31,256 after five years.</p>

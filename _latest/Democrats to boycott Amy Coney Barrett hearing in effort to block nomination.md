<div><p>Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will boycott Thursday&#8217;s vote to move forward on the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, the party&#8217;s Senate leader confirmed.</p>
<p>Speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) slammed Republicans&#8217; handling of Barrett&#8217;s nomination to the nation&#8217;s highest bench in explaining the decision.</p>
<p>Calling it &#8220;the most rushed, most partisan and least legitimate process in Supreme Court nomination history,&#8221; Schumer said that Democrats on the powerful committee would &#8220;not provide the quorum that is required,&#8221; referencing a Senate rule requiring members of the opposite party to be present to conduct government business.</p>
<p>In holding a boycott, Democrats will not be able to block Barrett&#8217;s nomination from going through in the GOP-held Senate. The sole purpose would be to force GOP lawmakers to flout the committee&#8217;s rules on procedure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Republicans have moved at breakneck speed to jam through this nominee, ignoring her troubling record and unprecedented evasions, and breaking longstanding committee rules to set tomorrow&#8217;s vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just 12 days before the culmination of an election that is already underway,&#8221; Schumer said in a statement Wednesday of the decision.</p>
<p>During Thursday&#8217;s proceedings, Democrats will hold a news conference on the steps of the Capitol, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/politics/barrett-nomination-republicans.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the New York Times reports</a>. In lawmakers&#8217; places will be <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/12/democrats-turn-acb-hearing-into-emotional-obamacare-appeal/">more blown-up photographs</a> of Americans at risk for losing health care coverage if Obamacare is overturned.</p>
<p>While Schumer spoke up on this decision, there was notable silence from Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who Schumer <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/schumer-refuses-to-defend-feinstein-as-dems-call-for-her-to-be-bumped/">refused to defend</a> for her handling of the Barrett hearings.</p>
<p>Feinstein, 87, repeatedly infuriated Democrats with her conduct at last week&#8217;s hearings, going as far as to praise Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) for his handling of this nomination process.</p>
<p>Schumer&#8217;s effort is not holding Republicans back from moving full steam ahead with Barrett&#8217;s nomination.</p>
<p>Asked about a potential Democratic boycott while speaking to reporters Wednesday, Graham said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll vote the nominee out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The political system is broken &#8212; I get that, plenty of blame to go around &#8212; but she is one of the best people anybody could ever nominate to the court, and she deserves a vote and she&#8217;s going to get one,&#8221; the South Carolina senator added.</p>
<p>Barrett is widely expected to be moved forward by the 22-member committee, which is made up of 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats.</p>
<p>She will then <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/senate-will-vote-on-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-nomination-on-monday/">face a vote Monday by the Senate</a>, where she is also widely expected to be confirmed.</p>

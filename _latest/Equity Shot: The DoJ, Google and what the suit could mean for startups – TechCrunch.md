<p>Hello and welcome back to&#160;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch&#8217;s venture-capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big day in tech because the U.S. federal government is going after <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank">Google </a> on anti-competitive grounds. Sure, the timing appears crassly political and the case is <a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1318595238374625281">not picking up huge plaudits</a> thus far for its air-tightness, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can ignore it.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">I</a> got on the horn to chat it up for about 10 minutes to fill you in. For reference, you can read the full filing <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7273457/10-20-20-US-v-Google-Complaint.pdf">here</a>, in case you want to get your nails in. It&#8217;s&#160;not a complicated read. Get in there.</p>
<p>As a pair we dug into what stood out from the suit, what we think about the historical context and also noodled at the end about what the whole situation could mean for startups; it&#8217;s not all good news, but adding lots of competitive space to the market would be a net-good for upstart tech companies in the long-run.</p>
<p>And consumers. Competition is good.</p>
<p>You can read TechCrunch&#8217;s early coverage of the suit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">here</a>, and our look at the market&#8217;s reaction <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/investors-appear-to-shrug-at-antitrust-lawsuit-aimed-at-google/">here</a>.

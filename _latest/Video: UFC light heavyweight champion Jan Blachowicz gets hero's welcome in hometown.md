Jan Blachowicz[autotag]’s hometown greeted him as a conquering hero.

The newly crowned UFC light heavyweight champion received a warm welcome Friday at the Cieszyn Market in his hometown of Cieszyn, Poland.

Blachowicz (27-8 MMA, 10-5 UFC) claimed the vacant UFC 205-pound title last month at UFC 253, which took place at Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. The 37-year-old stopped Dominick Reyes in the second round of their co-main event bout. The technical knockout came at the 4:36 mark.

This is not the first time Blachowicz has received praise from the Polish people, as he was received with joy at the airport after his flight back from Abu Dhabi. The “Polish Power” was also greeted by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in acknowledgment of his feat.

Below is Blachowicz’s hometown welcome:

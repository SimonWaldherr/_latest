<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, held onto his status as China&#8217;s richest tycoon this year as surging demand for online shopping and other services during the coronavirus pandemic swelled the fortunes of Internet entrepreneurs, according to a survey released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ma&#8217;s fortune rose 45 percent percent over 2019 to $58.8 billion, according to Hurun Research Institute, which follows the country&#8217;s wealthy.</p>
<p>Ma Huateng, founder of Tencent, which operates the popular WeChat messaging service, was No. 2 at $57.4 billion, up 50 percent. Debuting at No. 3 was Zhong Shanshan, chairman of bottled water brand Nongfu Spring, with $53.7 billion following his company&#8217;s Hong Kong stock market debut in September.</p>
<p>Rising share prices created an average of five new Chinese entrepreneurs worth at least $1 billion every week over the past year, according to Hurun&#8217;s founder, Rupert Hoogewerf.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world has never seen this much wealth created in just one year,&#8221; said Hoogewerf in a statement. &#8220;China&#8217;s entrepreneurs have done much better than expected. Despite Covid-19 they have risen to record levels.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>The richest woman on the list was Yang Huiyan of real-estate developer Country Garden. She was No. 6 at $33 billion, up 29 percent from last year.</p>
<p>Rankings of China&#8217;s richest change abruptly from year to year as real estate, technology and other industries rise and fall in the fast-evolving economy.</p>
<p>This year, the coronavirus boosted the fortunes of Alibaba&#8217;s Ma and other Internet entrepreneurs as the shutdown of the Chinese economy to fight the virus propelled demand for online shopping and business tools.</p>
<p>Eric Yuan of California-based video conference platform Zoom rose more than $10 billion to $16.2 billion. Li Yongxin of Offcn, an online work training platform, more than doubled to $20.6 billion. Chen Xiangdong of tutoring platform Genshuixue rose eightfold to $11.8 billion.</p>
<p>Ma, 56, retired as Alibaba chairman last year and also is a shareholder in Ant Group, a payments service spun off from Alibaba. It is preparing for a public share offering after being valued at $150 billion in a 2017 private financing round, which will add to Ma&#8217;s fortune.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs in electric cars, an industry the ruling Communist Party is promoting, also saw their fortunes swell.</p>
<p>Zeng Yuqun of battery producer CATL tripled to $17.6 billion. He Xiaopeng of electric car brand Xpeng, rose 80 percent to $6.6 billion following a stock market debut in New York. Li Bin of NIO rose 300 percent to $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>Business leaders who tumbled down the list included Ren Zhengfei, founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei. US. export controls imposed in a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/10/us-sanctions-on-huawei-hit-chip-supply-and-growth-exec-says/">feud with Beijing over technology</a> and security threaten to cripple its sales of smartphones and switching equipment. Ren&#8217;s net worth declined 10 percent to $2.8 billion, according to Hurun.</p>
<p>Lei Jun of rival smartphone brand Xiaomi saw his fortune more than double to $25 billion as its share price surged, possibly boosted by expectations sales will benefit from Huawei&#8217;s troubles.</p>

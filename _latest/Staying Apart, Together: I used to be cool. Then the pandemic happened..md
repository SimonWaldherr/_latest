I swear.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Just five years ago I went to all the trendy bars in Washington, D.C., wore the cutest outfits, <strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/06/09/what-i-learned-when-i-dyed-my-hair-a-crazy-color/85650322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">had purple hair</a></strong>&#160;and <a href="https://twitter.com/klawls/status/704060451034832896" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"><strong>even went to the Oscars</strong></a>. I stayed up until 2 a.m.&#160;or later, used the latest social media and technology (back then, it was Snapchat) and consumed a lot of avocado toast.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A world changed by the pandemic has coincided with many of my major life changes as I approach 30:&#160;Getting married, buying a house&#160;and planning for a family. But the changes to my life, and the world around me, have&#160;dramatically accelerated my transition from partying 20-something to old fogey. Once I used to save up for concerts and fancy cocktails, but for the past few days I've been staring longingly at an expensive vacuum cleaner. At this point I'm pretty sure that I will never understand TikTok.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Cocktail glasses"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A big part of this change is that my&#160;favorite activities of my early 20s&#160;&#8211; bar-hopping, dancing at clubs, attending festivals, going to a party at a friend's house&#160;&#8211; have been decimated by quarantine. Seemingly everyday I hear that&#160;a different&#160;club or restaurant I love <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/10/07/restaurants-small-businesses-face-closures-without-covid-19-stimulus/5916732002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"><strong>has closed forever.&#160;</strong></a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">So many of us, understandably, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/10/10/coronavirus-when-return-to-normal-life/5882898002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"><strong>want things to go back to normal as quickly as possible. </strong></a>But it's clear that some things have changed forever, even our very personalities. That can be scary, but it can also be good. I was always going to grow up. I couldn't day drink, scroll through Tinder, and Snapchat forever. And honestly, becoming a responsible adult, and yes,&#160;buying a fancy vacuum cleaner, is going to make me extremely happy.

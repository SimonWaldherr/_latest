<div><p>First lady Melania Trump was allegedly shocked that Anna Wintour had decided to feature Beyonc&#233; on the cover of Vogue magazine&#8217;s coveted September issue in 2018.</p>
<p>Trump expressed her feelings to her <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/06/melania-trump-calls-stormy-daniels-porn-hooker-in-new-recording/">then-friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff</a>, according to a secret recording of the phone conversation shared with NBC News.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anna [Wintour] gave the September issue of Vogue cover &#8212; complete, complete, complete, everything &#8212; to Beyonc&#233;,&#8221; the first lady allegedly said in the July 2018 recording.</p>
<p>&#8220;She hired black photographer. And it&#8217;s the first black photographer ever doing cover of Vogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tyler Mitchell, then aged 23, took the photos of the pop superstar, and became the first black man to shoot a cover image in the 123-year history of fashion bible.</p>
<p>It was initially reported that Beyonc&#233; had hired Mitchell, as Wintour had allowed the singer to take creative control of the magazine&#8217;s cover.</p>
<p>However, Mitchell subsequently tweeted that Wintour and Raul Martinez, Cond&#233; Nast&#8217;s corporate creative director, had suggested him for the shoot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyonc&#233; quickly agreed,&#8221; Mitchell wrote.</p>
<p>Winston Wolkoff, who was the first lady&#8217;s former friend and adviser, had previously spent a decade working at Vogue. The pair were discussing the departure of top editors at the magazine.</p>
<p>In a statement to NBC News, Trump&#8217;s spokesperson attacked Winston Wolkoff &#8212; who authored the book, &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Melania-Me-Rise-Friendship-First/dp/1982151242?tag=nypost-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Melania and Me</a>: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady&#8221; &#8212; but didn&#8217;t directly address the Beyonc&#233; remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her narcissism knows no bounds, this woman is a fraud,&#8221; said spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham. &#8220;These audio tapes are hand-picked about nonsense and presented with no context. Shame on her for this continued attempt at character assassination and shame on NBC for covering this gossip.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Beyonc&#233; declined to comment. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment from The Post.</p>
<p>The first lady&#8217;s alleged remarks on the Beyonc&#233; cover were made in one of six recorded telephone conversations, lasting more than six hours, that took place between February and July 2018, according to Winston Wolkoff.</p>
<p>She began recording calls with the first lady after she was asked to leave the White House amid scrutiny over spending by the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which she worked on.</p>
<p>And despite featuring on the cover of Vogue in her wedding gown in March 2005, Trump went on to say she would never be selected to appear on the cover of the magazine&#8217;s coveted September issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would never do it,&#8221; she allegedly said to Winston Wolkoff, a former Vogue special events director who planned the Metropolitan Museum&#8217;s Costume Institute Gala and later worked as founding fashion director for Lincoln Center.</p>
<p>Last week, it was announced that Winston Wolkoff is being <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/13/justice-dept-sues-ex-pal-of-melania-trump-over-book/">sued by the U.S. Department of Justice</a> for allegedly breaking a nondisclosure agreement in publishing her book, which hit shelves in early September.</p>
<p>The White House tell-all recounts Wolkoff&#8217;s nearly two-decade friendship with Trump and its bitter dissolution.</p>

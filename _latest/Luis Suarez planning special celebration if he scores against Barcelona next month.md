Luis Suarez has warned that he will find a way to taunt the Barcelona bosses if he scores against his old club next month.

Suarez was sold to Atletico Madrid after being told he had no future at the Catalan giants.

And while the former Liverpool striker insists he will not celebrate if he finds the back of the net when Barca visit on November 22, he will make his feelings clear to Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu.

Suarez said: “I will not shout ‘goal’ but I will point to those responsible. I spent six years there and felt I had earned respect.

“I deserved to know my fate before I found out from the press.

“Also the coach Ronald Koeman came to me saying that he doesn’t count on me. But that was after the leadership of the club had already said there was going to be a change of players.

“That raises doubts about whether it was the coach’s decision or a directive from above.”

The Uruguayan has also claimed recently that his exit from Barcelona was due to his friendship with Lionel Messi.

He told ESPN : "There are a lot of contradictions [in Barcelona's version of events].

"I would have looked for a solution if it was a financial problem and if it was a sporting issue I could have understood. It is not clear to me why they took the decision they took.

"I think they wanted to remove me from Messi's side. Maybe it annoyed them that I had a good relationship with Leo.

"Perhaps they didn't want him to be with me so much. I can't find any reason to think that would damage the team, though.

"We looked for each other constantly on the pitch, but for the good of the team. Maybe they wanted him to play with more team-mates.

"That could have something to do with it. I can't find any other reason to want to separate us because we got on well on the pitch."

In the latest blow to the travel sector, Turkey has just been added to the UK's quarantine list, as has Poland and three countries in the Dutch Caribbean: Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba. So all those returning from those countries from 4am on Saturday 3 October will have to self-isolate for 14 days.

There are now just six countries to which you can come and go freely (for now): Italy, Greece, Sweden, Germany, Gibraltar and San Marino, with a further ten (including Barbados, St Lucia, Medeira and Cyprus) that can be visited by taking a Covid test and in some cases, completing a short period of isolation.

Remember, for the exemption to apply, you can't have stopped in or travelled through any non-exempt countries in the preceding 14 days.

The much-anticipated 'air bridge' concept was shelved in favour of a 'traffic light' system whereby countries are classified as red, amber or green depending on the prevalence of coronavirus there. Those travelling from 'amber' or 'green' countries will not have to self-quarantine on arriving in the UK, those from 'red' countries will.

It should be noted that no quarantine on arriving home doesn't guarantee a reciprocal arrangement with every country. In other words, individual countries may still not welcome visitors or require them to self-isolate on arrival, although we know that this will not be the case in France, Italy and Spain, for example.

Here at home, there have been spikes in infection rates all over the UK and many partial and local lockdowns, particularly in the north of England, are now in place. In most cases, you can still travel to a hotel or exclusive-use holiday home, as long as you adhere to the 'rule of six'.

Should you have a yacht or a private jet handy, you'll probably have weathered all of it far better than the rest of us, being able to leapfrog the inevitable wait for train timetables and airline routes to right themselves.

Each country has its own, often complicated, set of rules and time frame for implementing them. So who is doing what?

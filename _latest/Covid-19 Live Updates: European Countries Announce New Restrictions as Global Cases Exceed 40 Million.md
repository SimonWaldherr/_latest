Cases have been detected in nearly every country around the world, and at least 1.1 million people have died.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Officials are desperate to avoid a second economically damaging blanket lockdown, and are instead seeking to tighten restrictions in a more precise fashion. Here&#8217;s the latest.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Austria</strong>, which reported 1,121 daily cases of the virus on Monday, announced new limits on the number of people who could meet privately starting Friday: six indoors and 12 outdoors. The country has reported nearly 10,000 cases in the past week, more than at any time in March, when the government imposed a nationwide lockdown. The restrictions were lifted over the summer as numbers dropped and the country sought to attract tourists, an important source of income for the alpine nation.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Italy</strong>, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that mayors will have the power to close streets or squares where people tend to gather after 9 p.m., while restaurants, bars and pubs will be allowed to serve seated customers &#8212; up to six per table &#8212; until midnight. Drinking outside of restaurants or bars will be permitted only until 6 p.m., and gaming and betting halls will close at 9 p.m. Italy has so far fared better than its European counterparts, but infections have been rising in recent weeks, with a record 11,705 new cases reported on Sunday. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Slovenia&#8217;s</strong> government declared a 30-day state of emergency after cases of the virus more than doubled in the past week, Reuters reported. The government will ban movement between regions that have been most affected by the pandemic and introduce a nightly curfew beginning at 9 p.m. starting Monday, Interior Minister Ales Hojs said at a news conference. Mr. Hojs said that all public and religious events would be banned, and that the number of people allowed to gather would be reduced to six from 10. Slovenia has reported 4,845 coronavirus cases in the past week, a spike from 2,255 cases the week before.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Britain</strong> has reported an average of nearly 17,000 new cases a day over the past week, according to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">New York Times database</a>, with almost a thousand new daily cases in Wales. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Wales</strong> will enter a national lockdown starting Friday night, the country&#8217;s first minister, Mark Drakeford, announced on Monday. The &#8220;firebreak&#8221; lockdown, which will last until Nov. 9, will require residents to remain at home and force pubs, restaurants and nonessential shops to close. Mr. Drakeford said &#8220;there are no easy choices in front of us&#8221; and called the lockdown &#8220;our best chance of regaining control of the virus&#8221; and avoiding strain on the National Health Service.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">About 2.3 million of the 3.1 million people in Wales were already living under local lockdowns. and the country has effectively shut its borders to travel from other parts of Britain.</p><p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Ireland</strong> is imposing tighter restrictions across the country, a cabinet minister said. Simon Harris, who was health minister in the spring and now heads the higher education ministry, said the current level of precaution in most of the country &#8220;has not worked&#8221; and that varying it by region had been ineffective, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ireland-idUSKBN2730EZ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a>. Mr. Simon suggested that many nonessential businesses would have to close, but that the new restrictions would be short of a total lockdown. The country has set new daily case records four times in the past week.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And officials in <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Bucharest</strong>, the Romanian capital, announced that schools, theaters and indoor dining will be closed for at least two weeks, and that masks will become mandatory in all public spaces. The city reported on Sunday that the virus rate over the previous 14 days had exceeded three cases per 1,000 residents, a red line for imposing stricter rules. After keeping the virus largely in check during the initial months of the pandemic, Romania has seen cases triple over the past month. While the schools will switch to online learning, there is deep concern that many students lack tablets and other necessary materials. </p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Melissa Eddy</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gaia-pianigiani" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Gaia Pianigiani</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anna-schaverien" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Anna Schaverien</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karen-zraick" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Karen Zraick</a> and </p><p class="css-608m5d" id="fauci-says-trumps-infection-was-no-surprise-and-a-campaign-ad-left-him-really-ticked-off-trump-called-him-a-disaster"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#fauci-says-trumps-infection-was-no-surprise-and-a-campaign-ad-left-him-really-ticked-off-trump-called-him-a-disaster">Fauci says Trump&#8217;s infection was no surprise, and a campaign ad left him &#8216;really ticked off.&#8217; Trump called him a &#8216;disaster.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/multimedia/19virus-briefing-fauci/merlin_177467934_6f01de87-054f-41a0-b3a3-a04d09452535-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Pool photo by Graeme Jennings</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was &#8220;absolutely&#8221; no surprise that President Trump got sick with the coronavirus, given his lax attitude toward social distancing guidance, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government&#8217;s top infectious disease doctor.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation: crowded, no separation between people and almost nobody wearing a mask,&#8221; Dr. Fauci said in an interview with the CBS program &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; which was broadcast Sunday evening. He was referring to an event at the White House in September to announce the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;When I saw that on TV, I said, &#8216;Oh, my goodness, nothing good can come out of that &#8212;&#160;that&#8217;s got to a be a problem,&#8217;&#8221; Dr. Fauci said. &#8220;Sure enough, it turned out to be a super-spreader event.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Numerous people who attended the event later tested positive for the coronavirus, including the president, his wife, his press secretary, two senators and the president of Notre Dame University.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Fauci, who has often been at odds with the president, sharpened his stance against an ad run by Mr. Trump&#8217;s re-election campaign that appeared to show the doctor praising the president&#8217;s handling of the coronavirus. Dr. Fauci said his words were taken out of context, and that their use in the ad was inappropriate because he never endorses candidates.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">When he saw the ad, he said, steam came out of his ears.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I got really ticked off,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump attacked Dr. Fauci on Monday in a conference call with campaign aides, calling the doctor a &#8220;disaster&#8221; and saying, &#8220;People are tired of hearing Fauci and these idiots, all these idiots who got it wrong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;People are tired of Covid,&#8221; Mr. Trump also said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview, Dr. Fauci pushed back against criticism that he had flipped-flopped over whether the general public should wear masks, saying that changing course after examining further data shows honesty.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He said he planned to cast his ballot in person, and that he would take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the F.D.A., whose vetting process he trusts.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The National Academy of Medicine <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://nam.edu/nam-awards-first-ever-presidential-citation-for-exemplary-leadership-to-anthony-fauci/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">honored Dr. Fauci on Monday</a> with the academy&#8217;s first Presidential Citation for Exemplary Leadership, citing his &#8220;distinguished service as a trusted adviser to six U.S. presidents during public health crises&#8221; and &#8220;steady leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/frances-robles" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Frances Robles</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="anticipating-coronavirus-vaccines-unicef-plans-to-stockpile-more-than-half-a-billion-syringes"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#anticipating-coronavirus-vaccines-unicef-plans-to-stockpile-more-than-half-a-billion-syringes">Anticipating coronavirus vaccines, UNICEF plans to stockpile more than half a billion syringes.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Humanitarian aid at a UNICEF warehouse in Copenhagen last week.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Associated Press</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">UNICEF, the world&#8217;s largest single buyer of vaccines, is not waiting for approval of the first coronavirus vaccines for widespread use. The U.N. agency said Monday that it was purchasing and distributing more than half a billion single-dose syringes and other critical equipment in countries where it operates, to be ready when the time comes.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-stockpile-over-half-billion-syringes-year-end-part-efforts-prepare-eventual" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a>, UNICEF said the advance stockpiling &#8212; a collaboration with GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance &#8212; was part of a larger plan to amass one billion syringes by 2021 to guarantee a supply &#8220;and help ensure that syringes arrive in countries before the Covid-19 vaccines.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Henrietta H. Fore, the executive director of UNICEF, said the agency was anticipating that the vaccination effort would be &#8220;one of the largest mass undertakings in human history&#8221; and was working to avert the possibility that vaccines would be available but the means to administer them would not.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;In order to move fast later, we must move fast now,&#8221; Ms. Fore said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As a rule, when it comes to syringe manufacturing and distribution, little moves particularly quickly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Unlike vaccines, which are heat sensitive and so are usually shipped by air, syringes, which have a shelf life of five years, generally make their way to their destination by sea, UNICEF said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">UNICEF said it expected to obtain the half-billion syringes by the end of the year. The agency said it was also procuring five million safety boxes for disposal of used syringes, as well as solar-powered refrigerators to store the vaccines in countries with scant access to electric power.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The UNICEF announcement came against a backdrop of uncertainty over precisely when any of the dozens of vaccines in various stages of development around the world would become widely available. The first are expected in coming months.</p><a class="css-1a9ghz5" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html"><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/18/us/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker-promo-1600439734668/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker-promo-1600439734668-articleLarge-v10.png"><h2 class="css-zd32qr">Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker</h2><p class="css-1uuihdo">A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans.</p></a><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Trump administration has publicly refused to join the international collaborative agreement known as Covax, under which the World Health Organization, GAVI and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations have collaborated to ensure that rich and poor countries simultaneously receive new coronavirus vaccines.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Instead, the U.S. government has pursued a unilateral vaccine development program known as Operation Warp Speed.

An adept worker will fill a 32-pound bucket every two and a half minutes, earning 65 cents for each one.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">This year, there is a new and even more difficult working condition: To keep the coronavirus from spreading and jeopardizing the harvest, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/coronavirus-tomato-migrant-farm-workers.html" title="">Lipman has put its crews on lockdown</a>. With few exceptions, they have been ordered to remain either in camps where they are housed, or the fields, where they toil.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The restrictions have allowed Lipman&#8217;s tomato operation to run smoothly, with only a handful of coronavirus cases, at a time when many farms and food processing facilities across the country have wrestled to contain outbreaks. But they have caused some workers to complain that their work site has become like a prison.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Gone are the weekly outings to Walmart to stock up on provisions; to El Ranchito, the Mexican convenience store, to buy shell-shaped concha pastries; and to the laundromat to wash heavily soiled garments.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You put up with a lot already. I never expected to lose my freedom,&#8221; said Martinez, 39, who is in his third year working in the tomato fields along the East Coast. (Many workers interviewed for this article asked to use only a first or last name for fear of losing their jobs.) He said workers spent months on end without interacting with anyone at all outside the farms, though Lipman eventually relented and organized a carefully controlled trip for groceries each week.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Lipman&#8217;s battle with its workers underscores one of the signature conundrums of the pandemic. Locking down its employees &#8212; a drastic measure that would be intolerable to most American workers &#8212; appears to have kept both the employees and the community safe. But at what cost?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The large tomato enterprise has been able to impose the restrictions on its workers because they are beholden to the company for their visa, housing and wages.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Lipman would not disclose total coronavirus case numbers, but employees said they knew of no cases at the Virginia operation following about six infections that occurred before most of the seasonal workers arrived. Kent Shoemaker, Lipman&#8217;s chief executive, said the company was proud of its record protecting both its employees and the surrounding communities.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;As of today, we do not have any confirmed Covid-19 cases on our farms or in our packing facilities,&#8221; Mr. Shoemaker said in mid-October.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan/" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="in-a-bright-spot-for-nyc-schools-10676-tests-yield-just-18-positives"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#in-a-bright-spot-for-nyc-schools-10676-tests-yield-just-18-positives">In a bright spot for N.Y.C. schools, 10,676 tests yield just 18 positives.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A public school in Brooklyn this month.

But China is the first to report growth that significantly surpasses where it was at this time last year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The vigorous expansion of the Chinese economy means that it is set to dominate global growth &#8212; accounting for at least 30 percent of the world&#8217;s economic growth this year and in the years to come, Justin Lin Yifu, a cabinet adviser and honorary dean of the National School of Development at Peking University, said at a recent government news conference in Beijing.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Chinese companies are making up a greater share of the world&#8217;s exports, manufacturing consumer electronics, personal protection equipment and other goods in high demand during the pandemic.

So far, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/arts/design/europe-museums-covid.html" title="">there&#8217;s little reason to be optimistic</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Almost all European museums are suffering from visitor losses, but their ability to cope depends almost entirely on how they are funded. Institutions supported by government funding are able to weather the storm with a little belt-tightening, while those that depend on ticket sales are facing tougher choices. Many are laying off employees and restructuring their business models.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Visitor information from across Europe tells a fairly consistent story: Museums that have reopened have about a third of the visitors they had this time last year. The Louvre in Paris reports about 4,500 to 5,000 visitors a day, compared with about 15,000 a year ago. The State Museums of Berlin, a group of 18 museums in the German capital, reports about 30 percent of its usual attendance.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Others are faring worse. The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is down to about 400 visitors a day, when it used to welcome 6,500. &#8220;It&#8217;s really very, very quiet in the museum,&#8221; said its director, Emilie Gordenker.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Travel restrictions and border closings have dramatically reduced the numbers of international tourists in European capitals. Over the summer, institutions in the Netherlands reported a boost in tourism from neighboring Belgium and Germany. That waned again when the school year started in September, and a surge of new coronavirus cases in the Netherlands led to &#8220;code red&#8221; alerts in several Dutch cities, including Amsterdam.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">European governments support many national cultural institutions, but there is a broad range of business models across the continent, from privately established museums that receive virtually no government money to those that are wholly subsidized by taxpayers. In recent years, however, governments in many countries, including the Netherlands, have been cutting support of museums, as politicians have encouraged the &#8220;American model&#8221; of funding, with more reliance on earned income.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  </p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid4-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="kenyas-health-minister-warns-of-a-second-wave-as-cases-rise"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#kenyas-health-minister-warns-of-a-second-wave-as-cases-rise">Kenya&#8217;s health minister warns of a second wave as cases rise.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Kenya&#8217;s government offered free coronavirus tests in the capital of Nairobi on Sunday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/world/19virus-briefing-KENYA/merlin_178692348_87b3a5c9-1dff-46ba-988c-1862e03826fa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Kenya&#8217;s government offered free coronavirus tests in the capital of Nairobi on Sunday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Tony Karumba/Agence France-Presse &#8212; Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Across Kenya, people in bars are hoisting drinks in proximity and taking to the dance floors of reopened nightclubs.

Large number of cases were also reported in prisons.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We can confidently point to a potential crisis unless we take some immediate action to avert this,&#8221; Mr. Kagwe <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.health.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NERC-MOH-CS-COVID-STATEMENT-18-10-2020.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a press briefing on Sunday</a>. &#8220;We can choose to sink or swim.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Kagwe blamed the rise in cases on the resumption of large public events including political rallies, weddings and burials. He said club owners weren&#8217;t enforcing social distancing and were not asking their patrons to wear masks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Kagwe also accused health workers &#8212; hundreds of whom have tested positive and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/world/africa/kenya-doctors-strike-coronavirus.html" title="">have protested lack of adequate protective gear</a> &#8212; of getting lax about protection.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;These times are not normal and please don&#8217;t treat them normally,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Normal behavior will have abnormal consequences.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Kenya has reported nearly 45,000 cases of the coronavirus and 832 deaths, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html" title="">a New York Times database</a>.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/abdi-latif-dahir" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-vaccine-that-has-not-completed-clinical-trials-finds-strong-demand-in-china"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-vaccine-that-has-not-completed-clinical-trials-finds-strong-demand-in-china">A vaccine that has not completed clinical trials finds strong demand in China.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A packaging facility of the Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech during a government-organized media tour in Beijing last month." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/world/19virus-briefing-china-vaccine1/merlin_177854064_771922b4-0273-4c3d-9f25-c3cf5e00fe54-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A packaging facility of the Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech during a government-organized media tour in Beijing last month.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Thomas Peter/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The eastern Chinese city of Yiwu has stopped the sale of a coronavirus vaccine after dozens of people demanded to be inoculated over the weekend, underlining the popularity of the treatment that has not even completed late-stage clinical trials.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Hundreds of people in Yiwu stood in line for a coronavirus vaccine after the government opened up bookings to the general public, the BBC <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-54582150" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Sunday. The local government had said on Friday it would allow people to be vaccinated on an &#8220;emergency use&#8221; basis, a day after the neighboring city of Jiaxing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/world/a-chinese-city-says-it-has-given-some-residents-a-vaccine.html" title="">announced the same</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The vaccine in Yiwu was made by a private company, Sinovac Biotech, according to The Paper, a Shanghai-based news website. Sinovac&#8217;s vaccine is in Phase 3 trials, the last stage of clinical trials before approval. Scientists have warned that taking a vaccine before the completion of clinical trials carries health risks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Sunday, The Beijing News, a state-run newspaper, cited a person familiar with the Yiwu health department as saying that the supply of vaccines had stopped and that people should not travel to the city to be vaccinated. But a representative from Yiwu&#8217;s center for disease control and prevention told The New York Times that local hospitals were still providing coronavirus vaccinations. He declined to confirm whether the sale had been suspended or provide more details.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">According to the newspaper, the local government&#8217;s intention was to find out what demand was like for &#8220;emergency users,&#8221; defined mainly as people who had to travel from Yiwu, an export powerhouse in China.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The high demand for the vaccine in China highlights the potential shortfall that local governments could face once a treatment is approved.

Tens of thousands of people have already been vaccinated, including government officials and executives of vaccine companies.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sui-Lee Wee</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/elsie-chen" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p></div>

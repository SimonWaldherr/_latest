In recent years scientists tracking the godwits have been stunned at the length of their migratory journeys, once thought to be impossibly long without a stop for food and rest.

Each year over 70,000 godwits make the autumn migration, returning to Alaska via Asia in the spring. Unlike seabirds they cannot feed and rest in the water.

Professor Theunis Piersma, of Groningen University, who leads the Flyway Network, called the birds' achievements "unimaginable".

Speaking to Dutch newspaper Trouw, he said: "If you look at the routes of the different birds on the map, you see that they are certainly not taking the shortest route, and sometimes also make big turns.

"We can only understand those routes if we project the high and low pressure areas with the corresponding wind directions on the map. Then the birds appear to make perfect use of favourable wind directions."

A map produced by the Global Flyway Network shows 4BBRW tacking east as it leaves Alaska before heading south-west towards the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu and course-correcting again to land just south of Auckland.

Godwits stock up on energy before their cross-Pacific journey by eating their fill of shellfish and seaweed, adding significant fat and doubling their weight to more than a pound, and shrinking their digestive organs to dispense with the unnecessary load.

As well as navigation skills, their journey is made possible by an extremely efficient flight technique, using just 0.42 per cent of their body weight each hour to fly at 60km per hour.

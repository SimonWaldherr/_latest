  Spending more on social services could save the lives of hundreds of babies a year in the US 
description: > 
  Spending more on environmental, educational and social services may save the lives of hundreds of babies a year in the US, a new study suggests.Previous research has shown that government spending on non-healthcare services can lower infant mortality rates.In 2000, 7.2 infants died per 1,000 live births compared to 5.7 infants died per 1,000 live births in 2018 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Researchers found that state and local governments spend an average of $9 per person for educational, social and environmental services.The team says more research is needed about what other factors may play a role in the link between spending and infant mortality.

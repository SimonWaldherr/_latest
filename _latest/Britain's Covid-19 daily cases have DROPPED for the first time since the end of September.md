<div><p class="adHolder" id="leader_wide"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boris Johnson today warned the UK is walking a 'narrow path' as it tries to squash the Covid-19 without hammering the economy with drastic lockdown rules after health officials recorded 241 more coronavirus deaths and another 21,331 cases.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The deaths mark a rise of 68.5 per cent from the 143 confirmed last Tuesday, while the cases are a 23.8 per cent jump on 17,234. The number of people admitted to hospital rose to&#160;1,019 on October 15, data published today showed, marking the first time since May that it had surged into four figures.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the numbers are rising across the board, there are signs the outbreak is slowing down in large parts of England, with infection rates falling in recent weeks and the speed of increase in national numbers shrinking and stalling in mid-October.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">England's deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, sent out by ministers to set the scene for tougher lockdown rules in Manchester tonight, admitted there are 'more patches of green' this week on heat maps that show how infection rates are changing across the country.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And he claimed the outbreak had morphed into a 'game of two halves', pointing to data showing that the weekly infection rates have declined for 10-19 year olds and 20-29 year olds. But in the same breath, he warned that cases 'seeded in the younger age groups are now penetrating those older age groups', who are most at risk of becoming severely-ill or dying from Covid-19.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Professor Van-Tam warned the outbreak has 'extended from coast to coast and now extends quite a long way down the country'. He also emphasised that the disease is still mainly concentrated in the North, insisting that it wouldn't be right to adopt tougher measures on millions living in the South.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister tonight conceded that 'the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in February and March' but told millions tuned in to tonight's Downing Street press conference that the data 'shows clearly why we must act'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Justifying why Number 10 has forced Greater Manchester into a Tier Three lockdown tonight after almost a week of wrangling with the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, Mr Johnson&#160;said action is needed to reduce the R rate and control the virus in the North, where the disease is most prevalent.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'We are walking a narrow path here today because we don't want to go back into a national lockdown with all the the damage - social, economic - that that can do. Unless we absolutely have to. We think that the local approach is the reasonable one.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Van-Tam echoed the PM's sentiment and said he was not in favour of a national 'circuit-breaker', adding: 'We are trying to walk a very fine line between getting the virus under control in areas where it is out of control and incurring the minimum amount of economic damage in doing so'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Labour politician Mr Burnham refused to accept Boris Johnson's advice because he was unhappy about the financial support on offer for local businesses. As well as forcing the rules onto Manchester, Government ministers are also considering tougher lockdown rules for Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the North East, Mr Johnson said.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><img id="i-2d5410a0a6cac58c" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="573" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder

class="mol-factbox-title">PM FORCES MANCHESTER INTO TIER THREE LOCKDOWN&#160;</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Boris Johnson has plunged Greater Manchester into Tier Three lockdown saying Labour mayor Andy Burnham had rejected his 'generous and extensive offer' of &#163;60 million of extra support for businesses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister said he had been left with no choice but to impose the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants as well as banning households from mixing indoors and in most outdoor settings after the Government was unable to reach a deal with local leaders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson said he appreciated the rules are 'tough, both on businesses and individuals' but that the move to the Very High alert level is needed in order to combat a surge in coronavirus cases in the region.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new rules, which include strongly advising against travel into and out of the area, will be formally presented to Parliament on Thursday before coming into force just after midnight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson said he regretted the fact the Government had been unable to strike a deal with Mr Burnham because 'we would have a better chance of defeating the virus if we work together'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said the funding package offered to the region was 'generous and extensive' and proportionate to what was offered to Merseyside and Lancashire which are already in Tier Three.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson said 'unfortunately' Mr Burnham opted not to accept the deal as he added: 'Given the public health situation, I must now proceed with moving Greater Manchester, as I say, to the Very High alert level because not to act would put Manchester's NHS, and the lives of many of Manchester's residents, at risk.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The offer made by Mr Johnson on extra business support was believed to have been worth &#163;60 million but it was not immediately clear whether the region would still be able to access the cash after the two sides failed to agree terms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PM was repeatedly asked during a Downing Street press conference to clarify whether Greater Manchester will receive the money but he was seemingly unable to provide clarity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'In respect of funding of Greater Manchester, obviously we want to do more, as we said earlier on today, but for the sake of fairness the deal has to be in line with the agreements we have reached with Lancashire and Merseyside for instance where we have made progress.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He insisted the region will have access to 'all kinds of funds' to support it through the restrictions and that the funds are 'massive'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What we couldn't do is do a deal with Greater Manchester that was out of kilter with the agreements we had already reached with Merseyside and with Lancashire,' he said.</p><img id="i-607d18e31cff9037" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="255" width="422"

this afternoon, the mayor had launched a furious tirade at the Government for imposing the harshest level of curbs without 'proper support', saying he had asked for what the region 'needed'.</p><p

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A deeper look at official data suggests that, although the numbers of people getting diagnosed is still rising, it is doing so more slowly than in the spring &#8211; and hospitalisations and deaths are increasing slower, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number of new cases, counted by the day on which the tests were done, fell for the first time in a month last week when it dipped from an average 16,550 on October 11 to 16,497 the next day, marking the first drop since September 11.

No, I don&#8217;t think that is right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don&#8217;t think that is consistent with the epidemiological picture that we are seeing.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">NHS data, meanwhile, shows that number of Covid-19 patients being admitted to hospital is increasing significantly slower than it was in the first wave in March and April.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number of newly-infected patients requiring NHS care nearly tripled in just ten days between March 23 and April 1, jumping from 1,271 to 3,564 on the worst day on record.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was the first week after Britain's draconian lockdown was announced and came around a fortnight before the peak in deaths, with&#160;1,122 fatalities announced on April 11.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in the most recent 10-day spell &#8211; between October 6 and October 15 &#8211; admissions rose by just 42 per cent in comparison, from 693 to 988.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The slower rate of increase in hospital admissions is one of the most reliable ways for comparing the speed of this outbreak with that of March and April. No public testing was done during the spring so comparing positive cases is not useful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Admissions will be rising slower this time around because there are fewer cases overall &#8211; up to 28,000 people are catching the virus each day in England alone, compared to between 100,000 and 150,000 in late March &#8211; and potentially also because different groups of

This was down by a third from the 236 daily infections reported the week before.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rolling seven-day average is considered the most accurate way to assess outbreaks because it takes into account day-today fluctuations in infections.&#160;Nottingham - the country's current Covid-19 hotspot - saw average daily cases fall by almost 30 per cent in the same period - from&#160;476.1 to&#160;338.3.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Manchester - which is poised to be plunged into a 'Tier Three' lockdown later today - the rolling seven-day average number of cases has been falling since September 28. On that date, the city was recording 419 cases a day, but this has since fallen to 335.4. The downward trend will raise doubts about whether the harshest lockdown bracket is really justified.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sheffield and Leeds, two other hotspots where local leaders are in crunch talks with Government about tightening Covid-19 restrictions, have seen cases steadily fall for a week, suggesting a downwards trend rather than a blip. Sheffield saw its average daily cases tumble from 414.4 on October 5 to 328.7 by October 12, while Leeds' daily cases fell from 483.6 to 419 in the same time period.</p><p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_4"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Although some of the country's major cities are seeing infections tumble, the towns and boroughs around them are starting to see steep increases, which may explain the Government's keenness to lockdown in more areas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manchester city is the only area in Greater Manchester seeing daily infections drop, but outbreaks in Trafford, Stockport and Oldham have also stabilised, Public Health England figures. And the rate at which cases are rising in the other nine boroughs has began to decelerate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, Bury was reporting an average 108 cases per day by October 12, up from 97 daily cases the week prior, an increase of 11 per cent. This a smaller ris than the one between September 28 and October 5, when daily cases jumped 33 per cent from 73 to 97.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A similar trend has played out in the other boroughs. In Wigan, the rolling seven day average number of daily cases is 205 - which is up nine per cent compared the seven days prior. For comparison, this figure almost doubled from September 28, when it was 99.3, to October 5's 188.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rochdale's is currently recording 149 cases per day, up by 16 per cent the week before, when it was 128.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The North West had 153 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending October 9, which was the highest number for the region since the week ending June 12. For comparison, the figure was just 106 for the previous seven-day spell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In North-East England, where deaths were also the highest since June and where tougher lockdown rules are also in place, 60 Covid-19 deaths were registered in the week to October 9 &#8212; up from 40 the week before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Registered deaths involving Covid-19 increased week-on-week in all but two regions of England in the week to October 9 &#8211; the exceptions were the East and South East.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Wales the weekly total increased from 25 to 37.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three people under the age of 40 died with Covid-19 in the most recent week, as the elderly continued to make up the vast majority of victims.

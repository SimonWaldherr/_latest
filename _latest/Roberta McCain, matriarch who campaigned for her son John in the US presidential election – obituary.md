  Roberta McCain, matriarch who campaigned for her son John in the US presidential election – obituary 
description: > 
  Roberta McCain, who has died aged 108, was the gregarious matriarch of the McCain family, whose members were at the centre of American military and political life for more than half a century; a mainstay of Washington’s social circuit, she rose to national prominence campaigning for her son, Senator John McCain, during his unsuccessful bid for the US presidency in 2008.Then in her late nineties, she attempted to allay voters’ concerns about her son’s age by pointing to her own sprightliness.Much to the alarm of his aides, she spoke candidly to journalists, at one point telling Republicans put off by her son’s independent streak that they would have to “hold their noses” and vote for him.

Roberta McCain, who has died aged 108, was the gregarious matriarch of the McCain family, whose members were at the centre of American military and political life for more than half a century; a mainstay of Washington’s social circuit, she rose to national prominence campaigning for her son, Senator John McCain, during his unsuccessful bid for the US presidency in 2008.

Then in her late nineties, she attempted to allay voters’ concerns about her son’s age by pointing to her own sprightliness. Much to the alarm of his aides, she spoke candidly to journalists, at one point telling Republicans put off by her son’s independent streak that they would have to “hold their noses” and vote for him.

<div><p id="speakable-summary">Disney announced earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/walt-disney-announces-reorganization-to-focus-on-streaming/">that it&#8217;s going all-in on streaming media</a>.</p>
<p>As part of this new strategy, the company is undergoing a major reorganisation of its media and entertainment business that will focus on developing productions that will debut on its streaming and broadcast services.</p>
<p>This will include merging the company&#8217;s media businesses, ads and distribution, and Disney+ divisions so that they&#8217;ll now operate under the same business unit.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch&#8217;s Jonathan Shieber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/walt-disney-announces-reorganization-to-focus-on-streaming/">reports</a>, Disney&#8217;s announcement follows a significant change to its release schedule to address new realities, including a collapsing theatrical release business; production issues; and the runaway success of its Disney+ streaming service &#8212; all caused or accelerated by the national failure to effectively address the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>So what better time than now to give Disney+ the Extra Crunch user experience teardown treatment. With the help of <a href="https://builtformars.co.uk/">Built for Mars</a> founder and UX expert Peter Ramsey, we highlight some of the things Disney+ gets right and things that should be fixed. They include zero distractions while signing up, &#8220;the power of percentages,&#8221; and the importance of designing for trackpad, mouse and touch outside of native applications.</p>
<h2>Zero distractions while signing up</h2>
<p>If the user is trying to complete a very specific task &#8212; such as making a payment &#8212; don&#8217;t distract them. They&#8217;re experiencing event-driven behaviour.</p>
<p>The win: Disney have almost entirely removed any kind of distractions when signing up. This includes the header and footer. They want you to stay on-task.</p>
<p></p><img class="size-large wp-image-2062328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-at-15.12.06.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="364"><p><strong>Steve O&#8217;Hear: This seems like a very easy win but one we don&#8217;t see as often as perhaps we should. Am I right that most sign-up flows aren&#8217;t this distraction-free and why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p><strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/peter-ramsey" target="_blank">Peter Ramsey:</a></strong>  Yeah, it&#8217;s such an easy win. Sometimes you see sign-up screens that have Google Adwords on it, and I think, &#8220;You&#8217;re risking the user getting distracted and leaving for what, half a penny?&#8221; If I had to guess why more companies don&#8217;t utilise this technique, it&#8217;s probably just because they don&#8217;t want to deal with the technical hassle of hiding a bunch of elements.</p>
<h2>The power of percentages</h2>
<p>Only use percentages when it makes sense. 80% off sounds like a lot, but 3% doesn&#8217;t. Percentages can be a great way of making a discount seem larger than it actually is, but sometimes it can have the reverse effect. This is because people are generally bad at accurately estimating discounts. &#8220;What&#8217;s 13% off &#163;78?&#8221;</p>
<p>The fail: If you sign up to a year of Disney+, then you&#8217;re offered 16% free. But 16% isn&#8217;t easy to calculate in your head &#8212; so people guess. And sometimes, their guesses may be less than the actual value of the discount.</p>
<p>The fix: In this instance, it would be far more compelling (and require less mental arithmetic), if it was marketed as &#8220;60 days free.&#8221; Sixty days is both easy to understand and easy to assign value to.</p>
<p></p><img class="size-large wp-image-2062329" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Percentages.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343"><p><strong>Percentages may be harder to process or evaluate in isolation as an end user but they are easy to compare with each other i.e., we all know 25% off is better than 10% off. Aren&#8217;t you advocating obscuring the actual saving in favour of what sounds better on a case-by-case basis and therefore actually working against the end user? Of course I&#8217;m playing devils advocate a little here.</strong></p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s actually a really complex dilemma, and there&#8217;s no &#8220;easy&#8221; answer &#8212; this would probably make a great dinner time conversation. Yes, if you&#8217;re offering two discounts, then a percentage may be the easiest way for people to compare them.</p><p class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></p>			</div>

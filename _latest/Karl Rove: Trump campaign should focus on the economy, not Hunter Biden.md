  Karl Rove: Trump campaign should focus on the economy, not Hunter Biden 
description: > 
  With less than two weeks left before the 2020 presidential election, former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said it would be more “effective” for the Trump campaign to focus on the economy as opposed to the Hunter Biden “scandal.”Rove made the statement on “America’s Newsroom” on Wednesday shortly after Trump 2020 Campaign National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley appeared on the program and explained the campaign strategy to focus on Hunter Biden and his international business dealings to attack Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.“The president isn't talking about Hunter Biden.What he is talking about is Joe Biden and what these emails now reveal is that Joe Biden is flatout corrupt,” Gidley said referencing the Hunter Biden emails reportedly revealing his foreign business dealings, including contacts in Ukraine and China.“We don't have a similar picture about Joe Biden.”Rove did, however, say, “We do know that Hunter Biden is a bad actor” and allegedly “used his father to make money with [Ukrainian energy firm] Burisma.”TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS WINNING THIS STATE IS VITAL TO CLINCHING ELECTION“We know about Hunter Biden,” Rove said.Biden took a different tone when addressing a more targeted audience in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.

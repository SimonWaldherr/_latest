  US election 2020 latest: Republicans approve Trump's Supreme Court pick vote ahead of debate 
description: > 
  The president is being counselled to use a softer touch this time around, after his belligerent attitude in the first debate was thought to have hurt him with suburban women, a key voting demographic.His advisers say allowing an opponent not always known for his way with words to speak uninterrupted could help his cause.Trump could very well decide he still needs to go on the attack, of course - or, in the heat of the moment, abandon his planned strategy.Biden flashed his temper two weeks ago but mostly maintained his composure and avoided serious pitfalls.In the final set-piece of a long presidential campaign, he may be tested one more time.

<div><h4><strong>North East and Tees Valley</strong></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/north-east-newcastle-tier-2-lockdown-rules/">North East</a> and Tees Valley have&#160;been placed under Tier 2 restrictions.</p>
<p>This includes Newcastle, South Tyneside, North Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland, Durham, Northumberland, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton-on-Tees, Darlington and Hartlepool.</p>
<h4><strong>West Yorkshire and Leeds</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/west-south-yorkshire-tier-2-leeds-sheffield-local-lockdown-rules/">West Yorkshire and Leeds</a>&#160;have&#160;been placed under Tier 2 restrictions.</p>
<p>The areas affected include Bradford, Kirklees, Calderdale and Wakefield.</p>
<h4><strong>Wales</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/wales-lockdown-fire-break-latest-local-rules-welsh-restrictions/">Wales is now in lockdown</a>&#160;after First Minister Mark Drakeford announced a 17-day&#160; &#8220;fire break&#8221; designed to contain the latest spike in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-uk-covid-deaths-cases-circuit-breaker-lockdown/">coronavirus</a> cases will be introduced across Wales.&#160;</p>
<p>The break will begin on Friday October 23, include the half-term holiday and last until Monday November 9.&#160;</p>
<p>After discussions with the Welsh cabinet Mr Drakeford said a &#8220;short, sharp, shock to turn back to clock, slow down the virus, and give us more time&#8221; was agreed.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone in Wales will be required to stay at home, this means working from home wherever that is possible, and the only exceptions will be critical workers and jobs where working from home is simply not possible,&#8221; Mr Drakeford told a press conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;All non-essential retail, leisure, hospitality and tourism businesses will close just as they had to during the March lockdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>Community centres, libraries and recycling centres will close and places of worship will no longer be able to hold regular services, except for funerals and weddings.</p>
<p>&#8220;This fire break is the shortest we can make it, but that means that it will have to be sharp and deep in order to have the impact we need it to have on the virus,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Following the half-term holiday, primary schools and special schools will reopen, Mr Drakeford said.</p>
<p>For secondary schools, only years 7 and 8 will return as normal after the holidays.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other children taking examinations will be able to attend, but all other students will continue their learning from home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Universities will continue to offer both in person and online classes, but students must stay home in their university accommodation under the new rules.</p>
<p>During the fire break, people will be banned from meeting people outside of their household both indoors and outdoors, unless they are in a support bubble.</p>
<p>In addition, all non-essential travel within Wales has essentially been banned with increased border restriction on travel into the country.</p>
<p>As of Friday 16 October, people living in areas with high levels of coronavirus in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/local-lockdown-travel-rules-holiday-uk-tier-1-2-3/">not allowed to travel to Wales</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>London</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/london-lockdown-tier-2-covid-rules/">London moved to&#160;Tier 2</a> coronavirus restrictions&#160;on October 17,&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/15/london-lockdown-tier-2-covid-rules/">putting around nine million people under new, tighter restrictions.&#160;</a></p>
<p>Sadiq Khan warned Londoners that they faced a "difficult winter ahead" adding that "no one wants to see restrictions, but these are necessary".</p>
<p>Rates are currently 97 per 100,000 and rising, and there will now be a ban on different households meeting indoors.</p>
<p>People should aim to reduce the number of journeys they make where possible. If they need to travel, they should walk or cycle where possible, or plan ahead and avoid busy times and routes on public transport.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/rule-6-covid-19-social-distancing-rules/">Rule of Six</a>&#160;will continue to apply outdoors and in private gardens.</p>

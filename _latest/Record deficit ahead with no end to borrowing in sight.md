<div><h4>Tax slump</h4>
<p>At the same time tax revenues slumped, though not nearly as fast as spending surged.&#160;</p>
<p>Total Government revenues were &#163;55.1bn last month, down from &#163;63.5bn in September 2019.</p>
<p>Much of this is due to weaker economic activity. GDP was around 9pc lower in August than it was before the pandemic,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/09/economys-recovery-slows-sharply-despite-eat-help-boost/"> so there is less activity to tax.</a></p>
<p>But some of this is deliberate. The Government has<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/08/mini-budget-2020-key-points-stamp-duty-government-vouchers/"> suspended stamp duty</a> on the first &#163;500,000 of property sales, cut VAT in hospitality and lowered some business rates bills.</p>
<p>It means frenzied activity in the housing market, for instance, is translating into only modest revenues for the Treasury.</p>

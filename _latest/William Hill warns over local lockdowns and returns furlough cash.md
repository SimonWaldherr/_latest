At present, around 10 per cent of its stores are shut as a result of local lockdowns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While William Hill's net revenue was down 9 per cent for the 13 weeks ending 29 September, the drop was lower than the 32 per cent decline it posted for the first-half, with growth in the United States cushioning the fall.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ulrik Bengtsson, chief executive of William Hill, said: 'We are very pleased with the trading performance of the group, which has been borne out of the commitment, resilience and hard work of our teams across the business. I could not be prouder of them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have moved the company forward with our relentless focus on our customers, enhancing the competitiveness of our product, and maintaining player safety as one of our highest priorities. We have reinvigorated the leadership team and they, in turn, have empowered their teams to deliver on our plans.'</p><img id="i-ac54e86b5095e9e3" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="398" width="634" alt="Revenue:&#160;William Hill's net revenue was down 9 per cent for the 13 weeks ending 29 September" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-ac54e86b5095e9e3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/08/34649750-0-image-a-2_1603264190370.jpg" height="398" width="634" alt="Revenue:&#160;William Hill's net revenue was down 9 per cent for the 13 weeks ending 29 September" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Revenue:&#160;William Hill's net revenue was down 9 per cent for the 13 weeks ending 29 September</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gambling firms, including rivals GVC and 888 Holdings, have been targeting overseas markets, especially the US, in a bid to offset a hit from tighter regulations in Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The US may be relaxing controls on gambling, but it could switch back in the opposite direction if the experience in Britain is anything to go by.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">William Hill said its international online operations had performed well, which was partially offset by unfavourable sports results, and signalled a return in footfall towards pre Covid-19 levels in its betting shops.</p><p class="home item html_snippet module">  </p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Caesars is set to snap up William Hill in a &#163;2.9billion deal to expand in the fast-growing US sports-betting market and intends to sell its non-US operations, including more than 1,400 UK betting shops.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">FTSE 250-listed William Hill's share price is flat at around the 280p mark.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Founded in 1934, William Hill employs 11,500 globally including around 8,000 people in the UK.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: 'William Hill&#8217;s latest trading update could be one of its last as a listed company if Caesars succeeds with its takeover offer. The latter is most interested in the US operations which remained the bright spot in the 13 weeks to 29 September with 10% total net revenue growth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It&#8217;s easy to see why Caesars wants to do a deal. William Hill would turbocharge its ability to grab a larger share of the US gaming industry which some analysts believe could be worth as much as $35 billion in time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'William Hill is certainly making good progress in the US, adding more US states to now have a presence in 14 territories. While the UK operations are starting to recover, strategically they are like a ball and chain around its neck with ever-tightening regulation putting pressure on earnings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Lots of people have said Caesars isn&#8217;t offering enough for William Hill, but ultimately it will be down to shareholders to decide whether or not to accept the offer. So far the big institutional investors are keeping strangely quiet on their voting intentions which suggest the takeover is far from a done deal.'</p></div>

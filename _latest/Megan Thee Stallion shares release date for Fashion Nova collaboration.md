Get ready, Hotties.

Megan Thee Stallion, 25, teamed up with Fashion Nova for a collaboration — and we finally have a look at what the Houston native designed.

According to Meg, the collection will center on denim for women of all shapes, sizes — and most importantly, heights.

“We got tall girl clothes, short girl clothes, thick girl clothes, skinny girl clothes, puppy clothes,” the 5-foot-10 superstar said on her Instagram. “Whatever kind of clothes you wanna wear, we got it.”

Indeed, the collection will not only include denim, bodysuits, crop tops, pants and cowboy hats, but will also feature matching looks for fans’ four-legged furry friends as well.

Megan previously gave a sneak peek at some of her designs for taller girls, sporting a pair of boot-cut, dip-dyed ripped jeans and a matching T-shirt with a denim corset.

The line will be available to shop on FashionNova.com on Nov. 18.

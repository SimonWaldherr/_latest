The whole concept of “putting a garden to bed” in one fell swoop in October has somewhat gone by the board for most gardeners, I think, in line with our increased awareness of how much the gradually collapsing mess out there is enjoyed and valued by assorted wildlife.

Watching blue tits feeding playfully on the seedy, bendy wands of Verbena bonariensis, for all the world like an unruly, feathered troupe of trapeze artistes, is a wonderful way to waste gardening time, I find. Here are a few more practical thoughts:

Stagger border work

Take time over the next two or even three months, as and when the weather allows, to gradually cut down, move, divide, cull, plant, tidy and generally take stock, concentrating on removing really ugly remnants first (as an example: Echinops ritro is a real shocker, so is first for the chop in my garden, whereas old Japanese anemones have quite an elegant winter presence, I find).

Also, prioritise clearing space for planting spring-flowering bulbs. First to go in should be alliums, then daffs, and last (as late as November), tulips. Plant them with a little bonemeal, as deeply as you can: ideally in a hole at least twice, preferably three times their height.

Deal with tricky perennial weeds

If isolated and spritzed with Roundup now, just before their leaves die back, bindweed and ground elder often give up, or may only appear severely weakened next spring.

Selective pruning only

It may come as a surprise to many that autumn is not a good time to indulge in indiscriminate pruning: spring/early summer shrubs will have made their flower buds, so any heavy-handed treatment could severely spoil their show.

Some of the late flowerers such as Buddleja davidii and big hybrid tea roses (but not old shrub roses that flower on last summer’s growth) may need to have some height removed to stop wind-rock, but will need “proper” pruning (down to a low woody framework) in early March.

However, a last smartening cut of hedges (especially privet) is definitely worth the effort.

Composting tips

Speed up the process by chopping everything up, especially the tall, almost woody stems of cut border perennials before you put them in the bin. A shredder is a boon in mid-sized and large gardens. Or collect everything in a big tip bag or barrow and go at it with the garden shears.

Soil improvement and mulching

This is largely a matter of convenience, tempered by one’s garden style. I mulch around young shrubs and perennials that I feel need nurturing through the winter, and add copious amounts of organic matter to the soil when I plant (or divide and replant).

However, I never spread a thick layer of organic matter all over the garden in the autumn, as it would hamper all the valuable self-seeding that goes on. So I mulch in the spring (when precious seedlings – as well as easily-removable-weedlings – are visible), to help retain winter moisture and generally condition the soil.

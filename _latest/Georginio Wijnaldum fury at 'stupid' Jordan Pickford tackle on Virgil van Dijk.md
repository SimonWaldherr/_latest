<div><p>Liverpool midfielder Georginio&#160;Wijnaldum last night branded <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/19/merseyside-derby-one-forget-officials-jordan-pickford-should/">Jordan Pickford&#8217;s challenge on Virgil van Dijk</a> a &#8220;stupid&#8221; act,&#160;claiming&#160;that team-mates suffered sleepless nights after the horror injury at Goodison Park.</p>
<p>In an astonishing attack on their Merseyside rivals, Wijnaldum accused Everton&#8217;s goalkeeper of having no care for a fellow professional with a tackle that caused anterior cruciate ligament damage to Van Dijk.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp also described Pickford&#8217;s challenge &#8212; as well as the tackle on Thiago Alcantara which led to Richarlison&#8217;s red card &#8212; as hard to accept, particularly as the Van Dijk&#8217;s injury saw no punishment after Var.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Of course we are upset,&#8221; said Wijnaldum. &#8220;The way Pickford went in on the challenge was completely, in my opinion, stupid. I believe he didn't want to injure Virgil the way he injured him but the way he took the tackle, basically he didn't care about what happened after the tackle.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of games against Everton, in my opinion they take it way too far in the games we play against them. We know it is a derby and everyone wants to win a derby so sometimes you go a little bit over the top but it was too much.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not only his tackle, we can talk about the tackle from Richarlison on Thiago was also a nasty one. That is what bothered me the most and I think most of the other players as well.&#160;</p>

<div><p>This Banksy may be trashy &#8212; but it fetched almost $10 million.</p>
<p>An oil painting by the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/24/why-banksy-could-be-coming-to-nyc-this-weekend/">notorious street artist</a> that depicted an idyllic Claude Monet scene blighted by discarded items has fetched the second-highest price ever paid for one of his works.</p>
<p>&#8220;Show Me the Monet,&#8221; one of several reworkings of classic paintings that Banksy called his &#8220;Crude Oils&#8221; collection, was expected to get between $3.9 million to $6.5 million at auction Wednesday.</p>
<p>But it far exceeded expectations as it sold to an unidentified bidder at Sotheby&#8217;s in London on Wednesday evening for $9.89 million.</p>
<p>It came after a &#8220;lively and competitive 9-minute bidding battle between clients from around the world,&#8221; Sotheby&#8217;s said.</p>
<p>The only other Banksy to sell for more was his painting of the British parliament populated by chimpanzees, which <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/04/banksy-painting-of-chimps-in-british-parliament-sells-for-record-12m/">sold for more than $12 million</a> a year ago.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Show Me the Monet,&#8221; Banksy transforms Monet&#8217;s masterpiece depicting a Japanese-style bridge in his famous garden at Giverny into a modern-day fly-tipping spot &#8212; littered with discarded shopping trollies and a fluorescent orange traffic cone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vandalized paintings reflect life as it is now,&#8221; the notoriously secretive artist, who has never officially been identified, said in 2005, when it was painted.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t live in a world like Constable&#8217;s Haywain anymore and, if you do, there is probably a travelers&#8217; camp on the other side of the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was one of the &#8220;strongest and most iconic&#8221; Banksy works to ever appear at auction, according to Alex Branczik, Sotheby&#8217;s European head of contemporary art.</p>

In ordinary times Vasiliy Lomachenko and Teofimo Lopez would be the fight of the fall, a lightweight title match about as compelling as it gets in the boxing world these days. Instead of a big crowd, the only fans at the MGM Grand conference center will be a few hundred sponsors and first responders with special invites. And, instead of pay-per-view, the fight will be televised live on ESPN, guaranteeing a larger audience than a pay-per-view even if the money isn&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t nearly the same.

Lomachenko seemed content to give the younger fighter time to reveal his patterns, with his offense popping up late in the second on a slick combination he landed in between Lopez's punches.&#160;<br><br>It takes confidence and smarts to let an opponent work without offering much return fire, but that's typically part of Lomachenko's game. However, DAZN's Andreas Hale noted the inherent danger in giving away rounds:<br><br></p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png">Video Play Button</a><p class="atom video-indicator"><p class="text">Videos you might like </p> </p><p class="">Lomachenko didn't offer much of anything in the fourth and fifth rounds, the spots where he usually establishes himself as the dominant fighter. Lopez didn't do much either, but his intermittent bodywork was enough to take the rounds.<br><br>Ring Magazine's Tom Gray felt Lopez's sound technique was getting the better of Lomachenko:</p><p class="">With Lopez holding a clear advantage, the Ukrainian champion finally started to press the action more in the seventh round.

Lomachenko's jab work was excellent, as he repeatedly snapped back Lopez's neck by going right down the middle. Lopez, who packs more muscle than Lomachenko, started to slow down in the late rounds. The body shots he was throwing early in the fight went by the wayside as he fought to keep Lomachenko from overwhelming him with his speed.<br><br>A stunning 12th round saw both fighters land some of their best punches. Lopez had been crumbling for a good five rounds or so, but he found a clearing in the final 30 seconds and rocked Lomachenko with a few great power shots. Here's how some of the round looked, per Top Rank Boxing:<br><br>A clash of heads in the final seconds opened up a gash over Lopez's right eye, which led to a somewhat anticlimatic conclusion to the bout.&#160;</p><p class="">Considering Lomachenko's resurgence in the second half of the bout, this result will have many fans clamoring for a rematch. The veteran hit higher highs over the course of the bout, but the upstart was in control for longer stretches.&#160; &#160;</p></div>

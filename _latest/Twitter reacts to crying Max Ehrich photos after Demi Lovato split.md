Max Ehrich doesn’t look good since breaking off his engagement to Demi Lovato.

Over the weekend, the actor from “The Young and the Restless,” 29, was photographed at the beach in Malibu — the same spot where he proposed to the 28-year-old singer in July — where he appeared to cry and mope solo. As the photos made the rounds online, some on social media speculated about Ehrich’s sincerity.

“Not Max Ehrich going to the beach where he proposed and sitting there sobbing at the ocean, sir who is this performance for??” one user tweeted.

“Max Ehrich saying Demi is using him as a PR stunt is so ✨hypocritical✨,” another wrote.

“I’m convinced that Max Ehrich thinks life is a movie after seeing him sulk around the beach,” another penned.

Others offered support for Ehrich, who previously pleaded for fans of Lovato to stop bullying him.

“I know Max Ehrich seems to have used Demi but I think all the hate should stop now. He’s clearly unstable and needs help. All this bullying isn’t ok,” one wrote.

In the wake of his September split from Lovato, Ehrich alleged he found out about their relationship status “through a tabloid.”

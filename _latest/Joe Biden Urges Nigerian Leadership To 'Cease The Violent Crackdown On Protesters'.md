<p>Last week, Buhari announced the government&#8217;s decision to&#160;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/world/africa/nigeria-protests-police-sars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disband SARS </a>among other promises of police reforms, in response to widespread protests led by Nigerians in the nation and Nigerian diaspora communities across the world.</p><p>The move was met with skepticism, though, since the government has made promises to reform the unit a number of times in previous years to no avail. Furthermore, Nigerian citizens feared that SARS officers would be&#160;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54506567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redeployed to other units.</a></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our leaders are trying to set confusion in our midst, Dear Youths please let&#8217;s not fall for this.

<p>On Tuesday night, after Governor of Lagos State Babajide Sanwo-Olu had&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/jidesanwoolu/status/1318587137978175488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imposed a 24-hour curfew</a>&#160;which began at 4 p.m. local time, witnesses at a demonstration reported seeing shots fired at the Lekki Toll Gate located in Lagos, Nigeria.

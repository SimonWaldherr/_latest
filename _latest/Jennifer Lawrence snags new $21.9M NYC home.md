<div><p>Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence and her art gallerist husband Cooke Maroney love the West Village so much that they&#8217;ve bought a $21.9 million residence at 17 Jane St., Gimme Shelter can reveal.</p>
<p>Their townhouse-style unit is the first to sell in this hot project, by developer Edward Minskoff and David Chipperfield Architects.</p>
<p>The unit was never listed. It was purchased anonymously, through Doc Babe LLC, care of Grant Tani Barash &amp; Altman in Beverly Hills, with attorney Jesse Gordon, who declined comment.</p>
<p>The purchase happened around the time the &#8220;Hunger Games&#8221; and &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook&#8221; star sold her Upper East Side penthouse for $9.9 million in July, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/29/jennifer-lawrence-sells-secret-nyc-penthouse-for-a-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as we exclusively reported at the time</a>.</p>
<p>Lawrence owned that uptown spread via another anonymous LLC, Monster 400, that she bought also care of Grant Tani Barash &amp; Altman and Gordon, according to property records.</p>
 
<p>Lawrence purchased that penthouse, at 400 E. 67th St., for $15.6 million in 2016.</p>
<p>She also <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/newlywed-jennifer-lawrence-selling-secret-nyc-penthouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">owns a unit at 443 Greenwich</a>, the former bookbinding factory in Tribeca where past and present buyers include Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel; Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds; race car driver Lewis Hamilton; pop star Harry Styles; and romcom queen Meg Ryan. Minskoff, who declined to comment on the Lawrence purchase, said the project has been &#8220;flooded&#8221; with showings following five months of being &#8220;locked out&#8221; during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The six-story building boasts seven units. It was built on the site of a former parking garage. Minskoff himself is moving into the top two floors. Lawrence bought one of two townhouse properties that are part of the project.</p>

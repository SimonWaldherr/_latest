  WASHINGTON — The Census Bureau, long the gold standard for nonpartisan probity and statistical rigor in the federal government, is rushing toward the close of the most imperiled and politicized population count in memory with two huge issues in dispute.The first is the overall accuracy of a hurried count, buffeted by the coronavirus on the one hand and partisan interventions by the White House on the other.For all its problems, the Census Bureau has mounted a dogged effort in recent days to fill in some of the count’s many gaps.It has plucked more than 16,000 census takers from places where it considers the count completed and dispatched them to states where the response is lagging, notably in the Deep South.But it comes after the bureau has curtailed counts in many areas, despite a federal court order to continue them until the end of October, and a barrage of complaints by census takers and others that tallies are inaccurate and incomplete.

WASHINGTON — The Census Bureau, long the gold standard for nonpartisan probity and statistical rigor in the federal government, is rushing toward the close of the most imperiled and politicized population count in memory with two huge issues in dispute.

The first is the overall accuracy of a hurried count, buffeted by the coronavirus on the one hand and partisan interventions by the White House on the other. The second is whether the use of that count will result in figures for congressional reapportionment shaped by political considerations instead of an objective count of all the nation’s residents as the Constitution requires.

For all its problems, the Census Bureau has mounted a dogged effort in recent days to fill in some of the count’s many gaps. It has plucked more than 16,000 census takers from places where it considers the count completed and dispatched them to states where the response is lagging, notably in the Deep South. The deployment is well above those of past censuses, and appears to reflect the bureau’s use of its new digital capabilities to post workers where they are most needed.

But it comes after the bureau has curtailed counts in many areas, despite a federal court order to continue them until the end of October, and a barrage of complaints by census takers and others that tallies are inaccurate and incomplete.

<p>What's more astounding is that the Cameron Peak fire is the second fire in 2020 to hold the title of largest wildfire in Colorado history. The <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6906/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pine Gulch</a> fire near Grand Junction briefly held that title, but for only 7 weeks, having burned 139,000 acres in late summer.</p><p>Looking at this in a vacuum, you might think of it as mere coincidence.

  <p>Examining all the evidence, it's clear why conditions are extraordinarily flammable this fall. It's a compound issue of short-term natural climate variability layered on top of fundamental changes to the long-term climate from global warming.&#160;</p>

              <p>Brad Udall, the senior water and climate research scientist at the Colorado Water Institute at Colorado State University, said 2020 started out promising.&#160;</p><p>"This year was shocking because we had a decent winter and on April 1 we had 100% of snowpack," he said. But things quickly turned disappointing. "With 100% of snowpack, you'd expect a decent runoff year. Instead, we ended up with 52% of what is normal."</p><p>The amount of water that runs off from snow cover, and the pace at which it melts, is important because it determines water availability for soil and vegetation in summer.</p><p>Udall says much of the poor runoff is a result of increased evaporation due to a very warm and dry spring and summer. Over the past few months there have been a number of significant heat waves in the West, two of which were of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wildfire-climate-change-extreme-weather/" target="_blank">historic proportions</a>. The extra added heat energy vaporizes spring snow cover, and the lack of new moisture provides nothing to buffer the loss.&#160;</p><p>In the Southwestern states, June through August rainfall was the lowest since 1895 and temperatures were the highest since 1895, <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/national-climate-202008" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to NOAA</a>. In Colorado so far, this year is the <a href="https://climate.colostate.edu/monthly_summary.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">8th warmest and 2nd driest</a> on record. Denver has experienced <a href="https://www.weather.gov/bou/DenverSummerHeat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more 90-degree days</a> than any year in its history.</p>

<p>"We've had next to no moisture over the last 3 months which is highly unusual. The Arizona monsoon often carries moisture to Colorado but this year it was a complete bust," said Udall.</p><p>The below map illustrates just how "off the charts" the atmosphere's demand for evaporation is. The more the atmosphere pulls moisture from the land, the drier and more flammable the trees, grass and brush become.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1-week EDDI (evaporative demand) was off the charts for most of Colorado and the High Plains.

  <p>Udall says that while most of the droughts of the 20th century were caused by lack of rainfall, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22082020/california-colorado-wildfires-climate-change-global-transformation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">today's droughts</a> are mainly caused by increased evaporation due to warmer weather. But drought is usually referred to as a short-term issue, and what's happening in Colorado is not temporary. He prefers the term aridification, because climate change, due to the burning of fossil fuels and the build-up of a heat-trapping carbon pollution blanket overhead, is systematically drying out the landscape.&#160;</p><h3>Climate change and "the recipe for large forest fires"</h3><p>If you look back over the past century, parts of Colorado have been warming faster than anywhere else in the nation. According to data from NOAA and an analysis by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/climate-environment/climate-change-colorado-utah-hot-spot/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Washington Post</a>, western and northern Colorado are warming at twice the average rate of the globe, having warmed about 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895.</p><p>A <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/39/eaaz4571" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a> published in September found that the frequency of combined heat waves and droughts -- which are more impactful when they occur in unison -- has increased significantly, especially in the western U.S. For example, the type of hot-dry event that would have been expected once every 25 years in 1950, now occurs 5 to 10 times every 25 years. &#160;</p><p>"Episodes of extreme dryness and heat are the recipe for large forest fires," said Mojtaba Sadegh, the senior author of <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/aaft-cda092120.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the study</a>. "These extremes are intensifying and extending at unprecedented spatial scales, allowing current wildfires to burn across the entire U.S. West Coast."</p><p>Colorado's state climatologist Russ Schumacher agrees, telling <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2020/08/20/colorado-wildfires-climate-change-drought-snowpack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Colorado Public Radio</a> this is pretty well in line with climate predictions, "What we're seeing here is indicative of the fact that when the hot, dry years come around, they're hotter. ... I think the frequency of these kinds of summers where we get in these hot, dry conditions is probably going to increase."&#160;</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-middle6" class="ad-leader-middle ad-wrapper ">

<p>Udall agrees, and warns we should get used to what he calls "the new abnormal." "The climate system has a really good memory and the cycle of heat and dryness is hard to break," he said.&#160;</p><p>Since 2000, the drought in the Western states has become so monumental that scientists are using the term "<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-drought-california-western-united-states-study/" target="_blank">megadrought</a>" to describe it. This spring climate scientists released a groundbreaking study saying that this is the beginning of the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6488/314" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">second worst drought</a> in the past 1,200 years, with a "large contribution from human-caused climate change."</p><p>The graph below from <a href="https://www.drought.gov/drought/states/colorado" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">drought.gov</a> shows that over the past 20 years drought has become a regular and potentially permanent part of Colorado's climate.

              <p>The effects on the Colorado environment are apparent. Since the 1930s the water available from Colorado snowpack has <a href="https://www.aspentimes.com/news/colorado-snowpack-struggles-in-south-colorado-river-basin-at-86-percent/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">decreased by 30%</a>. As a result streamflow in the Colorado River has decreased markedly. In a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018WR023153" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2018 study</a>, Udall and co-authors found that 50% of the river runoff decline was due to higher temperatures. &#160;</p><p>And this more arid climate has huge impacts, with larger wildfires and a longer fire season. In fact, wildfire season in the West is now <a href="https://www.usda.gov/topics/disaster/wildland-fire" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2 to 3 months longer</a> than it was in the 1970s. And since 1984, human-caused climate change has led to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5081637/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">doubling</a> of the area burned in the Western states, with about 50%of the increase being attributed to increases in the dryness of fuel.&#160;</p><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/19/054132fa-1e3c-4982-a691-f2c5bfffea71/thumbnail/620x349/5aaac938d2a34d56dd5eff5f15d34d0a/acres-burned-new.png#" alt="acres-burned-new.png " height="349" width="620" class=" lazyload"></span><p class="embed__caption"></p>

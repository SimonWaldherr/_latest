The president has even lost his longstanding advantage on economic matters: Voters are now evenly split on whether they have more trust in him or Mr. Biden to manage the economy.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On all other subjects tested in the poll, voters preferred Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump by modest or wide margins. Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is favored over Mr. Trump to lead on the coronavirus pandemic by 12 points, and voters trust Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump to choose Supreme Court justices and to maintain law and order by six-point margins. Americans see Mr. Biden as more capable of uniting the country by nearly 20 points.</p>

And he&#8217;s got to act fast,&#8221; Mr. Trump said of Attorney General William P.

And, by the way, we&#8217;re doing very well.

A day earlier, Mr. Trump repeatedly called his opponent &#8220;a criminal,&#8221; using the same word for a reporter he chided for not focusing on the Post story. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president has repeatedly called on Mr. Barr to intervene in issues since he was confirmed by the Senate. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"> Mr. Biden is leading or tied with Mr. Trump in nearly every public poll in the battleground states that handed Mr. Trump his 2016 victory.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has significantly cut into Mr. Trump&#8217;s edge on issues like the economy, and the president&#8217;s poor performance in handling the pandemic has brought his poll numbers down. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president made the comments during an interview in which his answers were studded with lies and falsehoods about a range of issues, and in which he criticized the Bidens, the news media and the infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony S. Fauci.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After spending Monday attacking Dr. Fauci, who remains popular in public opinion polls, Mr. Trump claimed Tuesday he was &#8220;not at odds&#8221; with him, before renewing the attacks. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president falsely described Dr. Fauci as a &#8220;Democrat,&#8221; and claimed he was a &#8220;good friend&#8221; of the family of Gov.

Cuomo of New York.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;He&#8217;s been there for a long time, I leave him there, and he&#8217;s been wrong,&#8221; Mr. Trump said of Dr. Fauci. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He then accused reporters of favoring Dr. Fauci &#8220;because they think he&#8217;s against me.&#8221; </p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="harris-will-do-a-virtual-rally-to-kick-off-early-voting-in-wisconsin"></p><p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70">DAILY SCHEDULES</p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#harris-will-do-a-virtual-rally-to-kick-off-early-voting-in-wisconsin">Harris will do a virtual rally to kick off early voting in Wisconsin.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Senator Kamala Harris campaigned at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville on Monday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20elections-briefing-sched/merlin_178773003_f9cff91b-af67-4b36-8e23-f0fa3cbaabc8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Senator Kamala Harris campaigned at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville on Monday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Charlotte Kesl for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Here are the daily schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Tuesday, Oct. 20.

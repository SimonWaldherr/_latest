Chris Brown was spotted in west London on Thursday - and is reported to have paid a visit to fellow singer Adele's house in the small hours.

According to eyewitnesses, the R&B star, 31, rocked up to 32-year-old Adele's swanky home around midnight - and stayed until 2AM.

A source told The Sun: 'It was all a bit cloak and dagger. He arrived in the middle of the night and didn’t leave until around 2AM.

'He arrived in huge, blacked-out cars, with plenty of muscle surrounding him!'

But Chris and Adele are merely friends, it would seem, with Chris in town to see his son Aeko, whom he shares with ex Ammika Harris.

He was seen in Notting Hill on Thursday with his rumored current girlfriend Gina Huynh, who seemingly went with him to see Adele.

The Turning Tables songstress met the Wet The Bed crooner at the 2013 Grammys.

Chris wore a jacket featuring colorful star patches over a white t-shirt with faded purple ruched pants for his late-night outing.

He finished the look with a green Los Angeles Angels baseball cap, several layers of bling and a pair of green and pink printed kicks.

He took precautions against COVID-19 in a blue surgical mask, after spending quarantine at home in the states.

His return to London comes after he was banned from the UK back in 2009, following his guilty plea in the felony assault charge brought by ex Rihanna.

Visa denied: The Indigo artist was subsequently denied a visa when trying to enter the country in 2010 for his Fan Appreciation Tour

The Home Office said in a statement to BBC at the time: 'We reserve the right to refuse entry to the UK to anyone guilty of a serious criminal offence. Public safety is one of our primary concerns.'

He completed his probation in 2015, and it appears that his ban from the country has since been lifted.

Brown's return was reported earlier this week, after he was spotted at Novikov, a Russian restaurant in the Mayfair neighborhood of London.

The Takers actor posted a sweet family photo Tuesday to Instagram from a park bench in an unknown location, writing: 'MADE IT.'

The co-parents reportedly spent the last few months apart, as she and the baby were in Germany when travel restrictions were put into place.

According to HollywoodLife, they agreed she should stay put with Aeko instead of risking their health to return, since the baby can't wear a face mask.

Daddy's girl: Brown has been enjoying some quality time during quarantine with daughter Royalty, six, whom he shares with Nia Guzman, 37 (pictured in January, 2020)

A source said in July: 'Ammika would love nothing more than for her and Aeko to be reunited with Chris. But their main priority as parents is the safety and well-being of their baby.

'Chris [was] not allowed to fly to Germany due to the current travel restrictions, which does not allow US citizens to fly to Germany.'

Brown has been enjoying some quality time during quarantine with daughter Royalty, six, whom he shares with Nia Guzman, 37.

He's recently been romantically linked to Huynh, 28, after they were spotted on the set of his new music video last week.

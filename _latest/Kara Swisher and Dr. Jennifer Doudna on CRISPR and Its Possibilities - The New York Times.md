  Kara Swisher and Dr. Jennifer Doudna on CRISPR and Its Possibilities - The New York Times 
description: > 
  CRISPR-Cas9 is the kind of scientific breakthrough that could change human evolution.Scientists call it “genetic scissors” — a tool that snips DNA with powerful and scary precision.As Dr. Jennifer Doudna, the co-developer of the gene-editing technology, explains, scientists can now edit the genomes of living organisms “like you might edit a Word document.”Dr. Doudna and her collaborator, Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry this year.So what does this technology mean for how we live — and die?And just because we can more precisely “edit” life, should we?

How will potential profit complicate the incentives of scientists? And just because we can more precisely &#8220;edit&#8221; life, should we?</p></div>

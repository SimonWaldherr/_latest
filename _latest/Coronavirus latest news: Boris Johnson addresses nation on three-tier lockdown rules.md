The Prime Minister is about to address the nation setting out his new three-tier strategy for local lockdowns.

The three-tier system will see different parts of England placed in different categories dependent on rates of infection, with areas in the highest level expected to face the toughest restrictions.

The new three-tier system, which he presented to MPs earlier today in the Commons, includes:

Medium tier: The medium level will cover most of the country and will consist of the current national measures - such as the rule of six and closure of venues at 10pm. High tier: This level reflects many of the current local restrictions, in these areas people will be prevented from mixing with other households or support bubbles indoors. But meetings of up to six people will be allowed outdoors in public spaces and private gardens. Very high tier: Applying to areas where transmissions rates are causing the most concern, pubs and bars will be forced to close and "social mixing" indoors and in private gardens will be banned at the minimum. Groups of up to six people could still be permitted to meet outside in public spaces, but additional restrictions will be imposed based on discussions with local leaders.

From Wednesday local authorities in the Liverpool City region will move into the highest alert level, meaning pubs and bars, gyms and leisure centres, betting shops and casinos will all be closed.

It comes as Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, warned coronavirus infections are now spreading to the elderly and moving south across the country.

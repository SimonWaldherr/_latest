Both Ninja and adidas have held nothing back since the early announcement of their partnership, and after quite a few reiterations of the “Time In” motif, the two are finally bringing it back to the beloved Nite Jogger silhouette in two distinct ways.

Bright like the online personality himself, the lead colorway strings together a number of bright tones — the loudest and most pronounced of which being a bright orange that dresses the mesh of the toe, the leather overlays, and the nylon along the side-panel. Blue, in complement, then coats atop, not only at the printed Three Stripes but also the eye stays in conjunction with some accenting yellows, “TIME IN” text, and some subtle shuriken motifs. The accompanying pair follows the same construction more or less, differentiating itself most in its scheme: a relatively dark make-up that adds alternating hits of pink and blue throughout the underlying weaves, laces, and tread.

Grab a detailed look at both options here and find them on adidas.com and possible select retailers come October 14th.

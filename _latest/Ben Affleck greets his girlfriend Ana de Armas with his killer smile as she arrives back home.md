They're one of the hottest Hollywood couples of the year, and he clearly only has eyes for his lady love.

Ben Affleck was seen giving a warm greeting to his girlfriend Ana de Armas in the Pacific Palisades, California on Thursday, flashing his killer smile whilst wearing a white t-shirt with the famous Cuban phrase, 'asere ya, gracias' on the front.

Armas, 32, was in a lovely light blue floral mini dress, carrying a garment bag along with a large leather tote as she appeared to be returning home from a photoshoot.

The Knives Out star also carried an iced coffee, and was wearing a standard blue surgical face mask.

An internet search for the meaning behind the Cuban Spanish word 'Asere' returns everything from 'buddy' to 'an assortment of smelly monkeys,' but in aggregate the phrase is used as a common greeting in Ana's native Cuba.

The gorgeous actress was born in the town of Santa Cruz del Norte on the northern Caribbean island.

Ana has appeared in several high end photoshoots of late, including spreads for Flaunt Magazine as well as Vogue Mexico.

Affleck's shirt was from the Cuban brand Clandestina.

The actor, a father of three, also wore dark pants and sported a scruffy dark beard when he greeted Ana on Thursday.

He met the future Bond girl on the set of their upcoming thriller Deep Water, in the fall of last year.

The film, which follows an estranged married couple who become entangled in a series of murders, is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith.

That celebrated author's work also served as the basis for the excellent 1999 film The Talented Mr. Ripley, which starred Affleck's childhood best friend Matt Damon.

The pair famously won Academy Awards together for their first joint screenwriting effort, 1997's now-classic drama Good Will Hunting, costarring the late and great Robin Williams in his only Oscar-winning role.

Matt and Ben, who are still close, recently announced their new charity initiative via social media, in a hilarious clip in which they are seen teasing each other.

The A-list besties are currently teaming up with Omaze for a new charity event that will raise money for the Eastern Congo Initiative and Water.org.

On Thursday, the pair made the announcement in a hysterical Instagram video, where they were seen picking on one another about their former roles as Batman and Jason Bourne.

In the video, the two Massachusetts-bred actors began explaining how the Omaze sweepstakes works.

One winner and one friend will be flown out to Los Angeles, all expenses paid, and will get to have lunch with Matt and Ben.

Things seemed to be moving along quite well until Ben decided that Matt, 50, wasn't giving his performance 100%.

'Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Cut. Cut. Cut,' the Argo director interjected. 'You gotta spice it up. You gotta be appealing.'

'What do you mean "spice it up"?' a confused Matt Damon asked.

Continuing the bit, Affleck informed his pal that his performance was so lackluster that 'no one wants to come have dinner with this guy' and proceeded to direct Damon to 'push it.'

Take two was no better and Ben stops once more, feigning exasperation, to critique Matt's delivery.

'Dude,' he sighs and tells him not to 'act weird.' Advising, 'Tell them something they're interested in like, "Hey, come see Jason Bourne and Batman ..."'

Matt hilariously cuts Ben off and deadpans: 'Robert Pattinson's coming?'

Without missing a beat, Ben quips back: 'No, Jeremy Renner will be there, though.'

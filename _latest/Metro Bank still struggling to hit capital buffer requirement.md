  Metro Bank still struggling to hit capital buffer requirement 
description: > 
  Metro Bank increased lending by 2pc in the third quarter, but warned that its capital levels remain below buffers expected by regulators as the lender continues to struggle with the fallout from the crisis.Total net loans hit £15.1bn in the three months to the end of September, driven by government-supported lending to small businesses.However, the bank said that while its core capital ratio, including additional funding known as MREL, was in line with requirements at 20pc, that level was below the excess buffer required by regulators.This meant Metro may have to raise more funds, pending the outcome of a review into capital requirements by the Bank of England that is expected to be completed by the end of the year.Metro provided no update on its bottom line at the end of the third quarter after swinging £241m into the red for its half-year.

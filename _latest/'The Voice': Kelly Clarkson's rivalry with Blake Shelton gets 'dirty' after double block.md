I think it&#8217;s time, after 19 seasons, that I just own it,"&#160;Shelton, dressed in a crown and royal cape, said on Tuesday's episode. "The truth is, this is my show.

Coach Gwen Stefani also turned.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>'The Voice' premiere:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/10/19/the-voice-kelly-clarkson-loses-four-chair-turn-after-mistake/5983396002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">John Legend's campaign-style ad attacking Blake Shelton backfires badly</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Clarkson didn't know she'd been blocked until Papa pointed it out.&#160;"Oh shoot, Blake. Did you block me?" Clarkson hissed. In typical Shelton fashion, he lied: "No I didn&#8217;t &#8230; it wasn&#8217;t me."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Turns out, Shelton could have saved his valuable block because, Papa had her heart set on joining the "God's Country" singer's team from the beginning. In fact, Papa&#160;sings at Shelton's Nashville bar, "Ole Red."</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-television-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Isn&#8217;t it a coincidence that she sings at my bar?" Shelton gloated. "I&#8217;m trying to get her out of the bar and into an arena."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Clarkson looked at the silver lining ("I&#8217;m sad I was blocked, but I would've&#160;lost anyways"), while Shelton let yet another thing get to his head&#160;("I&#8217;m surprised the coaches are coming after me when it comes to these country artists").</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But the block reignited Shelton and Clarkson's notorious feud.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"If she&#8217;s going to take Adam Levine&#8217;s place &#8211; you're in his chair&#160;&#8211; I feel like it gives me the liberty to really go for the throat," Shelton explained. "Kelly is my all-time favorite person to upset on this show, and I feel like I&#8217;ve pulled out about every trick out of the book."</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-television-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Clarkson, however, exacted her revenge by blocking Shelton from four-chair-turn&#160;Cami Clune, who angelically sang Bon Iver's&#160;"Skinny Love."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"This industry is full of ups and downs.

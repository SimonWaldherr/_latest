Joe Biden was not asked a single question about The Post’s bombshell exposé on son Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings during his 90-minute ABC News town hall on Thursday evening.

Moderator George Stephanopoulos and undecided voters asked the Democratic nominee about everything from mandating a COVID-19 vaccine to how he’d handle a defeat on Nov. 3, but no one pressed Biden on newly unearthed emails which showed Hunter Biden selling access to his then-vice president dad.

It was Biden’s first televised interview since The Post made public a tranche of documents from a laptop which allegedly belonged to Biden’s oft-troubled son.

Among the emails on the hard drive was one which indicated Hunter Biden introduced his father to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm who was at the time under investigation before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine to fire that prosecutor a year later.

Instead, Biden was lobbed a series of softball questions in Philadelphia on Thursday night while Stephanopoulos offered minimal pushback.

As the town hall ended, the former Clinton administration employee thanked voters for their “really terrific questions,” calling them “a service to our democracy.”

The Democratic nominee and Trump went in separate directions after their second presidential debate in Miami was canceled when Trump announced he was boycotting the event because organizers made it virtual.

Trump, meanwhile, was in Miami for a town hall with NBC News, moderated by Savannah Guthrie.

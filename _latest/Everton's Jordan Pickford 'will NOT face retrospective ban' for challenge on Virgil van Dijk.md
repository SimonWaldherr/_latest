  Everton's Jordan Pickford 'will NOT face retrospective ban' for challenge on Virgil van Dijk 
description: > 
  Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford is set to avoid a retrospective ban from the Football Association for his horror tackle on Virgil van Dijk in Saturday's Merseyside derby.England No 1 Pickford has been widely condemned for the tackle which has almost certainly ruled Van Dijk out for the season after a scan at the weekend confirmed an anterior cruciate ligament injury.It has been detailed that VAR reviewed the incident in question and determined that Liverpool were not awarded a penalty because Van Dijk was in an offside position.Van Dijk was taken to hospital for checks and Liverpool confirmed he will undergo surgery in what represents a devastating blow to their title defence.Speaking after a frantic 2-2 draw, which saw Liverpool denied a last-minute Jordan Henderson winner by VAR, Klopp was left bemused at the tackle on Van Dijk.

<div><p>David Cameron&#8217;s government struck a deal with the US to accept Osama Bin Laden&#8217;s former spokesman back to the UK after his release from jail, for fear of breaching his rights as a political refugee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/11399596/Father-of-one-time-Jihadi-John-suspect-is-jailed-in-US-over-Africa-embassy-bombings.html">Adel Abdel Bary</a>&#8217;s extradition to the US, to be tried for his role in the terror attacks on US embassies in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/11323219/Al-Qaeda-terrorist-accused-of-embassy-bombings-dies-in-New-York.html">Kenya and Tanzania</a> that killed 224 went, ahead only after the UK agreed to take him back as a successful asylum seeker, sources have told The Telegraph.</p>
<p>Bary, 60, an Egyptian national, is due to return to the UK in the coming weeks (if not days) after being freed from a US jail. He cannot be sent back to Egypt because it would breach his human rights due to the risk of being tortured or killed by authorities there.&#160;</p>
<p>Reports suggest that Bary will be given a council house and is likely to be put under surveillance.</p>
<p>A source said: &#8220;He would not have been extradited to the US in the absence of an undertaking that, as someone with acknowledged refugee status, Britain would be treated as his home country for that reason. Without that there could not have been extradition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism, said: &#8220;It is a matter of real concern that somebody convicted of serious terorism offences is being returned to this country without demur and I would be very interested to see what the Home Secretary and the Attorney General will have to say about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bary applied for political asylum in the UK in 1991 after fleeing Egypt where he was tortured as an opposition lawyer so severely that he was left with physical scars and mental ill health.&#160;</p>
<p>He secured asylum in March 1993 and was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1997. He brought his wife and three children over to the UK in 1993, and had three more children in this country.</p>
<p>A year after the embassy bombings, in which a further 5,000 people were injured, he was arrested in Britain in 1999 and finally extradited to the US after a lengthy legal battle.</p>
<p>The embassy bombings signalled the rise of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/25/osama-bin-laden-martyred-says-imran-khan/">Osama bin Laden</a> and al-Qaeda and would culminate with the 2001 attack on the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1340215/Hijacked-planes-devastate-World-Trade-Center-and-Pentagon.html">Twin Towers on September 11, 2001</a>.</p>

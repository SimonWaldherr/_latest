The NHS is encouraging sick patients to visit hospitals and GP surgeries during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic after thousands were turned away during lockdown.

A new campaign, "Help Us to Help You", is being launched to tell patients that they will not be viewed as a "burden" if they attempt to seek help for non-Covid ailments this winter.

It comes amid fears that the mantra of "Protect the NHS" – when people were urged not to visit hospitals or GPs for fear of spreading the virus – led to thousands of patients being unable or unwilling to seek help during the first wave.

Figures released on Thursday showed that more than 111,000 patients in need of routine treatment have now waited for more than a year.

Despite being ordered to restore all non-Covid services at the end of June, NHS hospitals completed 43 per cent fewer routine appointments in August compared to the same month last year.

Launching the new drive – aimed in particular at people who fear they may have cancer symptoms – Dr Nikki Kanani, the medical director for primary care in England, said staff had gone to "great lengths" to make sure non-virus patients are safe.

"Whether you or a loved one has a routine appointment, or a potential cancer symptom, our message is clear – you are not a burden. We are here to safely care, so please don't delay," she said. "Help us to help you, and come forward as you usually would."

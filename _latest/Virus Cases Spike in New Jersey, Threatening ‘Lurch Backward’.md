  Virus Cases Spike in New Jersey, Threatening ‘Lurch Backward’ 
description: > 
  “The numbers are up,” Mr. Murphy said.“They’re up — up and down the state.”Under a quarantine policy adopted by New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, New Jersey now exceeds the threshold — an average of 10 cases for every 100,000 residents for seven days — used to determine which states should be included in the travel advisory.Thirty-eight other states are on the list.The new cases, he said, do not appear linked to reopened schools or businesses, and are instead believed to be connected with private indoor gatherings that are harder to regulate.Mr. Murphy and the state’s health commissioner, Judith M. Persichilli, warned that cases could continue to climb as the weather cooled and people shifted their activities indoors, where the risk of spread was higher.

  No one has wanted peace more, sacrificed more or risked more to bring security to Afghanistan than Afghan women since the end of Taliban rule in 2001.Yet this most important voice is the one most often left out of the discussion as a peace deal is mapped out."Because of our recent military gains in much of Afghanistan, women are no longer imprisoned in their homes.As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton spoke frequently of the plight of Afghan women."Afghan women are now working in leadership roles in different sectors," Sidiqi said.

And those allies &#8212; Afghan women &#8212; wonder whether their rights to work and education will be able to survive the withdrawal of U.S. forces without a Taliban cease-fire and commitment to respect the gains women have made since 2001.</p><p></p><p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">No one has wanted peace more, sacrificed more or risked more to bring security to Afghanistan than Afghan women since the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/taliban-afghanistan#:~:text=The%20Taliban%20is%20a%20predominantly,Qaeda%20and%20Osama%20bin%20Laden">end of Taliban rule in 2001</a>.

They have broken norms, battled extremism in their own homes, fought for schools, served as journalists and dared to challenge traditions. All the while they have been peaceful and have argued for an end to the war between Taliban and Afghan forces.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Yet this most important voice is the one most often left out of the discussion as a peace deal is mapped out. That means that whatever is resolved between the U.S. and the Taliban, and then the Afghan government and the Taliban &#8212; the latter are now <a href="https://menafn.com/1100988439/Afghanistan-Latest-Doha-talks-fail-to-clinch-deal-on-ground-rules">talking in Doha, Qatar,</a> about rules that will govern talks about the shape of a future peace agreement &#8212; it is far from certain that the gains and autonomy of Afghan women can be maintained.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Before the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan soon after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the treatment of women &#8212;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/09/the-taliban-took-years-of-my-life-the-afghan-women-living-in-the-shadow-of-war">stonings, beatings, the closing</a> of all schools for girls, the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/womens-rights-afghanistan-history">banning of women from their own streets</a> without chaperones &#8212; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/19/world/in-afghan-refugee-camp-albright-hammers-taliban.html">horrified much of the Western world</a> and was a rallying cry for the need for change in Afghanistan, not just the removal of the Taliban for giving sanctuary to Al Qaeda.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Soon after the U.S.-led coalition arrived, the situation of women improved markedly as they reshaped their own communities for themselves. "Because of our recent military gains in much of Afghanistan, women are no longer imprisoned in their homes.

During that time, I've seen firsthand how much women have used the windows of stability created by the end of Taliban rule in Kabul and the coalition's training of Afghan forces to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/6/140619-shabana-afghanistan-boarding-school-girls/">teach children</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bysZpKfs0R0">launch businesses</a>, <a href="https://giwps.georgetown.edu/a-new-generation-of-afghan-women-leaders/">represent their people</a> as <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/afghanistan-female-judge-supreme-court/27102086.html">governors and judges</a>, <a href="https://thediplomat.com/tag/women-in-afghanistan/">deploy as diplomats</a> and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/magazine/afghanistan-women-security-forces.html">risk their lives</a> to become police officers and members of their country's military.

An estimated one-third of the country's civil servants are women.

I have spent time with girls studying to become doctors and with young women who are <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2011/11/21/giving-birth-to-progress/">saving women's lives as midwives</a>.

An adept worker will fill a 32-pound bucket every two and a half minutes, earning 65 cents for each one.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">This year, there is a new and even more difficult working condition: To keep the coronavirus from spreading and jeopardizing the harvest, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/coronavirus-tomato-migrant-farm-workers.html" title="">Lipman has put its crews on lockdown</a>. With few exceptions, they have been ordered to remain either in camps where they are housed, or the fields, where they toil.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The restrictions have allowed Lipman&#8217;s tomato operation to run smoothly, with only a handful of coronavirus cases, at a time when many farms and food processing facilities across the country have wrestled to contain outbreaks. But they have caused some workers to complain that their work site has become like a prison.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Gone are the weekly outings to Walmart to stock up on provisions; to El Ranchito, the Mexican convenience store, to buy shell-shaped concha pastries; and to the laundromat to wash heavily soiled garments.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You put up with a lot already. I never expected to lose my freedom,&#8221; said Martinez, 39, who is in his third year working in the tomato fields along the East Coast. (Many workers interviewed for this article asked to use only a first or last name for fear of losing their jobs.) He said workers spent months on end without interacting with anyone at all outside the farms, though Lipman eventually relented and organized a carefully controlled trip for groceries each week.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Lipman&#8217;s battle with its workers underscores one of the signature conundrums of the pandemic. Locking down its employees &#8212; a drastic measure that would be intolerable to most American workers &#8212; appears to have kept both the employees and the community safe. But at what cost?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The large tomato enterprise has been able to impose the restrictions on its workers because they are beholden to the company for their visa, housing and wages.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Lipman would not disclose total coronavirus case numbers, but employees said they knew of no cases at the Virginia operation following about six infections that occurred before most of the seasonal workers arrived. Kent Shoemaker, Lipman&#8217;s chief executive, said the company was proud of its record protecting both its employees and the surrounding communities.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;As of today, we do not have any confirmed Covid-19 cases on our farms or in our packing facilities,&#8221; Mr. Shoemaker said in mid-October.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan/" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="the-total-number-of-virus-cases-around-the-world-has-surpassed-40-million"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#the-total-number-of-virus-cases-around-the-world-has-surpassed-40-million">The total number of virus cases around the world has surpassed 40 million.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Treating a Covid-19 patient in Madrid last week." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/world/19virus-briefing-40M1/merlin_178602756_c09e7805-43da-4be8-b4c0-f5ba5dbf5666-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Treating a Covid-19 patient in Madrid last week.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Oscar Del Pozo/Agence France-Presse &#8212; Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The global total of coronavirus cases has passed 40 million, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html" title="">a New York Times database</a>.

That brings China almost back up to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html" title="">roughly 6 percent pace of growth</a> that it was reporting before the pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Many of the world&#8217;s major economies have climbed quickly out of the depths of a contraction last spring, when shutdowns caused output to fall steeply. But China is the first to report growth that significantly surpasses where it was at this time last year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The vigorous expansion of the Chinese economy means that it is set to dominate global growth &#8212; accounting for at least 30 percent of the world&#8217;s economic growth this year and in the years to come, Justin Lin Yifu, a cabinet adviser and honorary dean of the National School of Development at Peking University, said at a recent government news conference in Beijing.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Chinese companies are making up a greater share of the world&#8217;s exports, manufacturing consumer electronics, personal protection equipment and other goods in high demand during the pandemic. At the same time, China is now buying more iron ore from Brazil, more corn and pork from the United States, and more palm oil from Malaysia. That has partly softened the impact of the pandemic on some industries.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/keith-bradsher" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="in-a-bright-spot-for-nyc-schools-10676-tests-yield-just-18-positives"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#in-a-bright-spot-for-nyc-schools-10676-tests-yield-just-18-positives">In a bright spot for N.Y.C. schools, 10,676 tests yield just 18 positives.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A public school in Brooklyn this month.

There were only 18 positives: 13 staff members and five students.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And when officials put mobile testing units at schools near Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods that have had new outbreaks, only four positive cases turned up &#8212; out of more than 3,300 tests conducted since the last week of September.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">New York City is facing fears of a second wave of the virus brought on by localized spikes in Brooklyn and Queens, which have required new <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/nyregion/cuomo-shutdown-coronavirus.html" title="">shutdown restrictions</a> that included the closure of more than 120 public schools as a precaution.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But for now, at least, the sprawling system of public schools, the nation&#8217;s largest, is an unexpected bright spot as the city tries to recover from a pandemic that has killed more than 20,000 people and severely weakened its economy.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In September, New York became the first big urban district to reopen schools for in-person learning.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Roughly half of the city&#8217;s students have opted for hybrid learning, where they are in the building some days, but not others.

The Hadassah-Ein Kerem hospital also said that treating Mr. Erekat was an &#8220;enormous challenge&#8221; as he is the recipient of a lung transplant and is immunocompromised. He is also fighting a bacterial infection in addition to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Erekat, who is the secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization&#8217;s Executive Committee, tested positive for the virus earlier this month.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">His wife, Neamh Erekat, is also infected, but her condition is improving, Palestinian officials said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Erekat, who has long supported nonviolence and the two-state solution, has been intimately involved in Palestinian politics and Israeli-Palestinian negotiations for decades. He was a central member of the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid peace conference in 1991 and has served as a close aide to Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Erekat has also been one of the loudest Palestinian voices rejecting the Trump administration&#8217;s policies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In other developments around the world:</p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Officials in <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Melbourne, Australia</strong>, announced some easing of one of the world&#8217;s strictest lockdowns, allowing residents to travel up to 25 kilometers from their homes and up to 10 people from two households to socialize outdoors. Dan Andrews, the premier of the state of Victoria, drew a contrast between the situation there and in <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Britain</strong>, where there have been fewer restrictions despite a surge in cases. &#8220;Back in August and at our peak, we reported 725 daily cases.

Mayors will have the power to close streets or squares where people tend to gather after 9 p.m., while restaurants, bars and pubs will be allowed to serve seated customers &#8212; up to six per table &#8212; until midnight. Drinking outside of restaurants or bars will be permitted only until 6 p.m. Gaming and betting halls will close at 9 p.m. Italy has so far fared better than its European counterparts, but infections have been rising in recent weeks, with a record 11,705 new cases reported on Sunday.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Ireland</strong> will reimpose tighter restrictions across the country on Monday, a cabinet minister said in a televised interview. Simon Harris, who was health minister in the spring and now heads the higher education ministry, said the current level of precaution in most of the country &#8220;has not worked&#8221; and that varying it by region had been ineffective, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ireland-idUSKBN2730EZ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a>.

Churches and mosques have started hosting congregations, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/07/world/covid-coronavirus/after-suspending-the-academic-year-kenya-begins-a-phased-reopening-of-its-schools" title="">schools have partially reopened</a>, and the notorious traffic in cities like Nairobi has partly resumed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After almost five months of a strict lockdown and dusk to dawn curfew, the authorities in Kenya last month eased the restrictions meant to curb the spread of the pandemic. But on Sunday, Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said the relaxation of the rules could lead to a second wave of the coronavirus. He said the percentage of positive test results had increased this month, after restrictions were lifted, and admissions to intensive care units had increased in recent days. Large number of cases were also reported in prisons.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We can confidently point to a potential crisis unless we take some immediate action to avert this,&#8221; Mr. Kagwe <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.health.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NERC-MOH-CS-COVID-STATEMENT-18-10-2020.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a press briefing on Sunday</a>. &#8220;We can choose to sink or swim.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Kagwe blamed the rise in cases on the resumption of large public events including political rallies, weddings and burials. He said club owners weren&#8217;t enforcing social distancing and were not asking their patrons to wear masks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Kagwe also accused health workers &#8212; hundreds of whom have tested positive and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/world/africa/kenya-doctors-strike-coronavirus.html" title="">have protested lack of adequate protective gear</a> &#8212; of getting lax about protection.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;These times are not normal and please don&#8217;t treat them normally,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Normal behavior will have abnormal consequences.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Kenya has reported nearly 45,000 cases of the coronavirus and 832 deaths, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html" title="">a New York Times database</a>.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/abdi-latif-dahir" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-vaccine-that-has-not-completed-clinical-trials-finds-strong-demand-in-china"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-vaccine-that-has-not-completed-clinical-trials-finds-strong-demand-in-china">A vaccine that has not completed clinical trials finds strong demand in China.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A packaging facility of the Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech during a government-organized media tour in Beijing last month." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/world/19virus-briefing-china-vaccine1/merlin_177854064_771922b4-0273-4c3d-9f25-c3cf5e00fe54-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A packaging facility of the Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech during a government-organized media tour in Beijing last month.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Thomas Peter/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The eastern Chinese city of Yiwu has stopped the sale of a coronavirus vaccine after dozens of people demanded to be inoculated over the weekend, underlining the popularity of the treatment that has not even completed late-stage clinical trials.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Hundreds of people in Yiwu stood in line for a coronavirus vaccine after the government opened up bookings to the general public, the BBC <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-54582150" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Sunday. The local government had said on Friday it would allow people to be vaccinated on an &#8220;emergency use&#8221; basis, a day after the neighboring city of Jiaxing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/world/a-chinese-city-says-it-has-given-some-residents-a-vaccine.html" title="">announced the same</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The vaccine in Yiwu was made by a private company, Sinovac Biotech, according to The Paper, a Shanghai-based news website. Sinovac&#8217;s vaccine is in Phase 3 trials, the last stage of clinical trials before approval. Scientists have warned that taking a vaccine before the completion of clinical trials carries health risks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Sunday, The Beijing News, a state-run newspaper, cited a person familiar with the Yiwu health department as saying that the supply of vaccines had stopped and that people should not travel to the city to be vaccinated. But a representative from Yiwu&#8217;s center for disease control and prevention told The New York Times that local hospitals were still providing coronavirus vaccinations. He declined to confirm whether the sale had been suspended or provide more details.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">According to the newspaper, the local government&#8217;s intention was to find out what demand was like for &#8220;emergency users,&#8221; defined mainly as people who had to travel from Yiwu, an export powerhouse in China.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The high demand for the vaccine in China highlights the potential shortfall that local governments could face once a treatment is approved. Unlike in the United States &#8212; where <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-anti-vaccine.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email" title="">a growing number of polls</a> have found that many people would not get a coronavirus vaccine in part because they feel the Trump administration is pushing for its approval before fully weighing the safety and efficacy data &#8212; many people in China are flocking to get one.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">China has indicated it would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/business/china-coronavirus-vaccine.html" title="">expand the number of &#8220;emergency users&#8221;</a> for a vaccination program, saying it plans to target people at higher risk of being exposed to the virus such as travelers and health care workers. Tens of thousands of people have already been vaccinated, including government officials and executives of vaccine companies.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sui-Lee Wee</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/elsie-chen" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p></div>

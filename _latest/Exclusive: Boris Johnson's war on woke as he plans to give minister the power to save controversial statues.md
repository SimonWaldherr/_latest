Boris Johnson is to give a minister the power to veto the removal of statues, plaques, and memorials across the country, to help guard against campaigners and politicians "bullying" local officials into wiping out public heritage.

The Government is preparing to change planning rules to allow Robert Jenrick, the Housing Secretary, to take over formal applications relating to the dismantling of statues and other monuments, rather than the final decision resting with councils.

The move would amount to the Government's first legal intervention relating to recent cultural clashes that have led to museums, councils and universities facing pressure to remove statues, plaques and other objects linked to the country's colonial past.

Tower Hamlets, a Labour council in east London, is one of the latest local authorities to consider relocating or removing statues in the borough, according to a dossier compiled by the Policy Exchange think tank. Lambeth, another Labour council in the capital, is also intending to "review existing troubling or historic links and assess whether we can legally suggest new names or commemorations".

The government plan comes after Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, separately wrote to publicly-funded museums and galleries warning that they could jeopardise their taxpayer support by removing statues or other artefacts as a result of pressure from campaigners.

Under planning laws, the Housing Secretary can generally take over, or "call in", planning applications if the proposal conflicts with national policy in a major way, or is nationally significant. However, the minister is bound by a set of specific criteria for the type of application that can be called in.

The Telegraph understands that the Government is planning to amend the current criteria to include planning applications for the removal of public heritage such as statues, plaques and memorials.

If Mr Jenrick took over such cases, an inspector would carry out an inquiry, which the minister would then have to take into account before reaching a decision.

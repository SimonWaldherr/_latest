Broadway star Mandy Gonzalez of the hit musical sensation Hamilton faced quite a challenge this year, finding herself diagnosed with breast cancer in January right ahead of worldwide COVID-19 crisis.

Now the actress, 42, is opening up to People about her ordeal, an already harrowing fight which was only complicated by the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing lockdown two months later.

'I think of everything that I went through in this past year, it's like I'm a different person,' Gonzalez reflected.

Telling her story: Mandy Gonzalez, of the hit musical Hamilton, faced quite a challenge this year in addition to an already difficult 2020 – she was diagnosed with breast cancer in January

'And you can't not be: You have your life before your diagnosis and then you have your life after. And I think there is a place where you can just say, "That's okay".'

As a result of COVID-19, Mandy's cancer treatment in New York City became inaccessible as hospitals in the area became inundated with sufferers from the pandemic.

The mother-of-one instead had to seek chemotherapy in New Jersey, where she had to be alone due to restrictions put in place.

As many others did, Gonzalez referred to that time as 'end of the world' days.

Thankfully, she was able to successfully finish her treatment, and in July, she rang a special bell in the hospital signifying that she was cancer-free.

Next to a video post showing her ringing the bell on Instagram, Gonzalez wrote at the time, 'She asked "Do you want to ring the bell?" I say "Absolutely!"

'9 months ago, when my cancer journey began, I would dream of this moment. The day my treatment is done. I made it,' she continued.

'I’ve been through so much and have learned so much. I ring this bell with strength and gratitude.'

Now, Mandy is a Breast Cancer Research Foundation ambassador, and she no longer feels the trepidation she first encountered when prompted to share her experience with the disease.

At first, she Mandy noted that 'it felt very scary every time I had to tell anybody ... I think it's hard for a lot of women to be vulnerable, but putting it out publicly was my ask for help and support.'

Now, she shares her story so as to raise awareness and help others, especially Latinx women, for whom breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death.

'I needed to use my voice and use my platform so that, if there are young people that have a similar background to me ... they know that this is something that can [affect] your life,' she told People.

'Latinx is very underrepresented when it comes to research,' she later added. 'And part of that is because women, I think, are putting themselves second when it comes to self-care. And I know that's a big part of my community: you work and you take care of your family. But because you take care of yourself, it doesn't mean that you're selfish. It just means that you're also looking to take care of your family, because you matter so much to your family.'

And of course, Mandy is not the only celebrity opening up and being candid about her breast cancer journey.

On Tuesday, Beverly Hills, 90210 star Shannen Doherty – who is battling stage IV of the disease – uploaded a stunning outdoor portrait of herself, and included several useful and important facts about breast cancer in order to raise awareness.

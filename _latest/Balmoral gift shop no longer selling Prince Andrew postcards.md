The gift shop at Balmoral Castle is no longer selling postcards of the Duke of York to visiting tourists, it has emerged.

The shop at the Queen's Scottish residence no longer stocks images of the Duke, while postcards of the Prince of Wales, Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex remain on sale, the Sun reported.

It comes in the wake of the Duke "stepping back" from public duties following the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.

He has not appeared at any official royal engagement since, and was absent from the wedding photographs of his daughter Princess Beatrice.

A source said the Balmoral gift shop had only a "very small selection of postcards" which had not been restocked since 2017.

The Sun on Sunday reported that the shop, which has been reopened to visitors after the Queen departed from her summer retreat, had a glaring omission in its postcard selection.

One tourist told the newspaper: "Previously Andrew postcards have been on sale. But while there are postcards of Charles, Anne and Edward — and even the Queen's grandchildren, Beatrice and Eugenie — there is not one of the Duke of York.

  Trump slams reporter who criticised attacks on Joe and Hunter Biden 
description: > 
  President Donald Trump on Monday called a reporter a 'criminal' when he questioned the president's constant attacks on Joe and Hunter Biden as 'corrupt.'When a reporter asked why his strategy was to call Biden a criminal, Trump responded: 'He is a criminal.He said that if former Vice President Biden makes it into the Oval Office: 'He's gonna lock down.The alleged emails included one that alluded to a meeting between Joe Biden and Vadym Pozharsky an adviser for the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board.'So a giant trove of emails show Hunter Biden making deals, setting up deals with his father Joe,' Trump said at one point.

<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">President Donald Trump on Monday called a reporter a 'criminal' when he questioned the president's constant attacks on Joe and Hunter Biden as 'corrupt.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You're a criminal for reporting it. You are a criminal for not reporting it,' the president said, lashing out at a reporter who asked about his apparent campaign strategy to call Biden a 'criminal.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He is a criminal. He's a criminal. He got caught, read his laptop,' Trump said, in reference to Hunter Biden's laptop, which had alleged contents put out by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani including documents purporting to show Hunter's business transactions in Ukraine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And you know who is a criminal here? You're a criminal for not reporting it,' Trump scolded reporter Jeff Mason of Reuters, who asked the question. 'You are a criminal reporting it. Let me tell you something, Joe Biden is a criminal and he's been a criminal for a long time, and you're a criminal and the media for not reporting it. Good luck, everybody. Have a good time.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president unleashed the attack shortly after he went after a&#160;New York Times report that catalogued 'sobering political assessments' of Republican political operatives that he might lose the election. He called his own rallies 'boffo' going and tore into the lead author of the piece.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It all happened on a day when he also ripped nfectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and termed Fauci and other experts 'idiots.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amid a campaign swing out West, Trump directed a pair of emails at reporter Maggie Haberman, the lead reporter on an article that stated the best the president's lieutenants can do is 'to keep the president occupied, happy and off Twitter as much as possible' amid the increasingly dire scenario he faces.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'@MaggieNYT There has never been a time in either of my two Campaigns when I felt we had a stronger chance of winning than we do right now,' Trump responded. 'Early voting reports look far stronger than originally anticipated. Every RALLY is BOFFO. &amp; team are doing a fantastic job,' he wrote, using a term that came to prominence in the 40s and 50s.&#160;</p><img id="i-e8f0beac228323fe" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="634" alt="President Donald Trump ripped a New York Times report depicting his political predicament as 'dire'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-e8f0beac228323fe" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/20/34550186-8856663-image-a-24_1603135069722.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="President Donald Trump ripped a New York Times report depicting his political predicament as 'dire'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">President Donald Trump ripped a New York Times report depicting his political predicament as 'dire'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There has never been more enthusiasm or spirit, by everyone.

The current death rate, which is a lagging&#160;and can potentially rise several weeks after cases increase, is well below the April peak of nearly 2,000 fatalities a day.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nationwide hospitalizations have been increasing this month, which have been driven mostly by Midwestern states where infections have been surging.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Michael&#160;Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, gave a grim prognosis on Sunday night, saying he didn't share Trump's optimism about the virus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearly 70,000 new cases were reported nationwide on Friday, which is the highest level since July during the summer peak.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Osterholm said that figure was worrying and perhaps a sign of things to come, despite many arguing that this is a a result of increased testing capacity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Friday we had 70,000 cases, matching the largest number we had seen back during the really serious peak in July.

And even then, about half of the US population at this point is skeptical of even taking the vaccine.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Osterholm blamed the skepticism on a 'major problem in messaging.'&#160;He argued that Americans don't have a 'lead' or 'consolidated' voice to guide them through the pandemic at the moment.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'People don't know what to believe, and that's one of our huge challenges going forward [is] that we've got to get a message to the public that reflects the science and reflects reality,' Osterholm said.&#160;</p><img id="i-de41c707732a20da" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="442" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-de41c707732a20da" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/19/34554492-0-image-a-7_1603132017498.jpg" height="442" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-18715d07df161705" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="442" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-18715d07df161705" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/19/34554464-0-image-a-9_1603132017501.jpg" height="442" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-72befe247d4a2493" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="550" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-72befe247d4a2493" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/19/34569206-0-image-a-8_1603132017499.jpg" height="550" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the White House emerged as a solid front when it enacted the coronavirus task force back in January, the facade slowly waned as Trump ignored health experts' guidelines and dissenting voices entered civil discourse.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump and Fauci have publicly bumped heads over various issues before, although his latest remarks about the 'super-spreader' White House event are perhaps the starkest example to date.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fauci also admitted in his 60 Minutes interview that the White House had restricted his media appearances throughout the pandemic.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You know, I think you'd have to be honest and say yes.

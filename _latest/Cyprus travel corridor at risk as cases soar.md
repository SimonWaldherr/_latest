<p>British holidaymakers planning to visit Cyprus this half term could be in for disappointment, as the country risks losing its travel corridor in the Government&#8217;s weekly update tomorrow.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Covid-19 case numbers have spiked in the Mediterranean island nation. Yesterday, the country saw 152 cases, up from 83 this time last week and 29 the week before that.</p>
<p>The brings the number of cases per 100,000 over seven days up to 73.1 &#8211; higher than the threshold of 20, after which a quarantine is considered by the UK Government.</p>
<p>Grant Shapps is due to make an announcement on the UK&#8217;s travel red-list tomorrow, at 5pm. In recent weeks major holiday destinations, including Italy, Portugal and Turkey, have lost their travel corridors, meaning Britons arriving back in the UK need to go into a 14-day quarantine.</p>
<p>The Government is under rising pressure to introduce a testing regime so holidaymakers can avoid a quarantine, and to help kick-start the UK's beleaguered travel and tourism industry. Earlier this week the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/quarantine-one-week-december-testing/">said that he is "hopeful" that testing for international travellers </a>could be implemented by December 1, cutting quarantine from 14 days to approximately one week.&#160;</p>

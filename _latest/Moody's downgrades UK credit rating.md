The UK's credit rating has been downgraded by one of the big three ratings agencies.

Moody’s cited weak economic growth and other factors for its decision to lower Britain's grade by one notch to Aa3 - its fourth-highest ranking.

The pandemic has blown a big hole in the public finances, with the Government spending billions to support jobs and prop up an economy that has already suffered its biggest quarterly contraction on record.

The pandemic has pushed the national debt above £2 trillion, or more than 100pc of GDP.

“Even before the coronavirus-induced shock, a combination of persistently low productivity growth since the global financial crisis, tepid business investment since the June 2016 EU referendum, and prolonged uncertainty over the eventual future trading relationship with the EU were weighing on the UK’s growth performance,” Moody’s said.

Moody’s, which has had a negative outlook on the UK since November, said its outlook on the new rating was stable.

Sterling was largely unmoved after Moody’s announcement late Friday night, ending at $1.2915.

Illinois authorities have determined the AR-15 rifle used to kill two people and injure a third during unrest in Kenosha was purchased, stored and used in Wisconsin, and that Kyle Rittenhouse never possessed it in Illinois.

That bit of information came from the Lake County State's Attorney's Office in a news release issued Tuesday. The release said police in Antioch, Rittenhouse's hometown — and where he turned himself in — investigated any possible crimes Rittenhouse may have committed in Illinois, but found none.

The statement does not indicate whether someone else possessed the gun in Illinois, or where it is now. It said prosecutors — not Antioch police — would release any additional information "as to not disrupt any investigation that may be taking place in Wisconsin."

'That's the shooter':Witnesses describe the night Kyle Rittenhouse opened fire in Kenosha

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Network, has sued to obtain records of Rittenhouse's arrest in Illinois.

Rittenhouse, 17, remains in a Lake County juvenile detention center awaiting a ruling on his lawyers' attempts to block his extradition to Wisconsin. He is facing six charges, including one count of first-degree intentional homicide, and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.

Rittenhouse was acting as self-appointed security against rioting on the third night of protests after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August and considered himself a militia member, the Journal Sentinel has reported.

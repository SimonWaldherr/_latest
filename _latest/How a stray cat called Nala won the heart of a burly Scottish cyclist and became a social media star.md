Dean Nicholson was always more of a dog person. Cats were something that bit and scratched you. But an impetuous moment of compassion, while cycling up a mountain in the middle of Bosnia, not only changed his view of cats, it transformed his life and his view of humanity's relationship with animals.

A wee scrap of a kitten abandoned on a roadside has blown open the Scot’s world. That kitten, whom he named Nala after the character in The Lion King, has opened doors to homes, and the pair have welcomed hospitality from refugee camps to anonymous cities.

In the process, the world, too, has fallen for him and Nala. To date Nicholson’s Instagram account, @1bike1world, has 827,000 followers. He receives an unwieldy 10,000 messages a day on the platform.

He’s used the fame to raise more than £100,000, from raffles and a calendar, for small charities that look after strays and mistreated animals.

In a world of bad news, it’s easy to see how an account full of serendipity, hope and charitable work can have captured the attention of so many.

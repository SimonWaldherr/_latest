"If it [the Government] continues with this, jobs will be lost, businesses will collapse, the fragile economies of the North will be shattered," he said. "The Government has a real choice here. If it proceeds on the path, the central so-called mission of this Government to level up will be over.

"We are talking of low-paid people, people who work in pubs and bars. If you are on the minimum wage working in a bar, you can't pay two-thirds of your rent, two-thirds of your bills. It's discriminatory. There is a legal route, because why should a hospitality worker be treated differently to other workers whose businesses have closed?"

He was backed by David Greenhalgh, the Tory leader of Bolton council, who said the new three-tier coronavirus restrictions regime was "oppressive" and warned that delaying payment of the furlough money until late November was "not good enough".

"At the very least, these packages need to return to the furlough of the March lockdown. And anything less is quite frankly unacceptable," he added.

The Manchester City Council leader, Sir Richard Leese, said there was a "large gulf" between the Government and councils in discussions about new restrictions, adding that its data showed there was "no evidence that closing pubs works".

"We are still getting things coming from Government... proposed solutions with no evidence to suggest why they are needed and no evidence to suggest they would work, when all the evidence we have got says they are looking in the wrong place," he said.

Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, anticipated that ministers could face legal action from businesses that were forced to close but not shut by the legislation, because they would not be entitled to any furlough or other aid and could claim to be victims of discrimination.

"A lot of hospitality businesses will be hammered if you can't travel in or out of an area," she said. "Hotels won't have any business but they won't get any help because they are closing by default rather than legislation."

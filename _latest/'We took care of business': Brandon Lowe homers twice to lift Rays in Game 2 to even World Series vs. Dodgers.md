  'We took care of business': Brandon Lowe homers twice to lift Rays in Game 2 to even World Series vs. Dodgers 
description: > 
  ARLINGTON, Texas -- Really, you thought the Tampa Bay Rays were going to go quietly into the night?“I don’t think anybody in our clubhouse thought the series was over,’’ said Lowe, hitting just .107 until his two-homer night.Just like that, the Rays won their first World Series game in 4,381 days, dating back to Oct. 23, 2008, and are alive for their first championship in franchise history.This is a team that entered the game hitting .190 since the start of the ALCS.I know there’s more Dodger fans than Rays’ fans, but I’m kind of embracing it, and using that as a little bit of motivation knowing the fans are a little one-sided here.’’Besides, these are the Rays.

We got some momentum.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And the belief that they never forgot to hit, after all.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is a team that entered the game hitting .190 since the start of the ALCS. They had gone five consecutive games without scoring more than four games. They had set a postseason record hitting .230 or lower in 10 consecutive games.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe celebrates his two-run home run with shortstop Willy Adames in the 5th inning."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But in Game 2, they got their swagger back, with 10 hits by eight players, and scoring runs off four different pitchers.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Tonight&#8217;s game is more indicative of the type of team we have,&#8217;&#8217; said Wendle, who had a key two-run double in the fourth inning, their only hit with a runner in scoring position. &#8220;We&#8217;ve done it all year. We&#8217;re confident we can keep doing it as well.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">There&#8217;s no one more responsible for that confident feeling than&#160;Lowe.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is was their MVP of the regular season, but when the postseason hit, he&#160;struggled. He got one hit in his first 36 at-bats, but Rays manager Kevin Cash kept showing confidence in him.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lowe&#8217;s struggles were intensifying by the game. He didn&#8217;t&#8217; even hit the ball out of the infield in Game 1. When he stepped to the plate in the first inning Wednesday, he was on a four-for-52 skid (.077) with 19 strikeouts in 15 games, with starter Tony Gonsolin on the mound.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He swung and missed on Gonsolin&#8217;s 95-mph fastball. He patiently watched the next three pitches for balls. Gonsolin came back with a fastball. This time, Lowe was ready, sending it over the left-center-field fence.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In the fifth inning, with Dustin May on the mound, the Dodgers&#8217; fourth pitcher of the night, he fouled off May&#8217;s 97-mph fastball. He was fooled, swinging and missing on May&#8217;s curveball. May came back with another 86-mph curveball, Lowe swung, and sent it atop the left-field wall for a 2-run shot, while May looked up and screamed.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He became only the second&#160;American League second baseman to hit two homers in a game, last done by Tony Lazzeri of the 1932 New York Yankees, and the sixth second baseman overall.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>PROBLEM?</strong> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/gabe-lacques/2020/10/22/dodgers-pitchers-bullpen-world-series-game-2-rays/3724340001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Dodgers' convoluted pitching plans backfire in Game 2 loss</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>2021:</strong> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/10/21/mlb-fans-2021-world-series-attendance/5992966002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Playoff plan provides a path to have fans return next year</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lowe circled the bases, stepped on home plate with his right foot, turned to the dugout, and there was shortstop Willy Adames, giving him a forearm shiver.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Willy almost toppled me over,&#8217;&#8217; Lowe said. &#8220;It was just sheer joy, with everyone happy and jumping up and down.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lowe&#8217;s teammates knew the frustration and pain he was enduring. And finally, he was able to come through at the most critical time of the season.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;To say my mind wasn&#8217;t going in different places during the struggles,&#8217;&#8217; Lowe said, &#8220;I would be lying to you. But as soon as I started dragging my feet, there was someone to pick me up and say, 'Let&#8217;s get going.&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It would have been easy for Cash to sit him for at least a day, if not, drop him in the lineup, knowing that his slump was costing them games.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cash refused, telling Lowe before every game that this would be the day.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We&#8217;re not here if not for him,&#8217;&#8217; Cash said. &#8220;Sometimes you have to allow some guys go to go through some rough patches, and he&#8217;s been through one. He can go quiet for a while, but when he gets hot, he&#8217;s as hot as hitter in the game.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cash&#8217;s faith was almost out of loyalty. He watched him hit .269 with 14 homers and 37 RBI during the season with a .916 OPS (on-base-plus-slugging percentage), with a team-leading 2.1 WAR. Cash saw the slumps. But he also saw the torrid hitting streaks.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He refused to give up on him now.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;It was definitely a confidence boost,&#8217;&#8217; Lowe said. &#8220;When my confidence was wavering, when&#160; I wasn&#8217;t feeling too good mentally, he was right there. He&#8217;s say, 'You&#8217;re going to get two hits today. You&#8217;re going to do something to change the game.&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to have a manager never waver in his confidence to you.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Just like that, Lowe is back.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">So are the Rays.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Who knows, maybe they&#8217;ll even get some fans turning their way, with most of the 11,472 fans in attendance wildly cheering for the Dodgers, hoping their 32-year championship drought comes to an end.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;To be honest with you,&#8217;&#8217; Lowe said, &#8220;its welcoming for me. I know there&#8217;s more Dodger fans than Rays&#8217; fans, but I&#8217;m kind of embracing it, and using that as a little bit of motivation knowing the fans are a little one-sided here.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Besides, these are the Rays. They never have fans. Their bandwagon is always empty.

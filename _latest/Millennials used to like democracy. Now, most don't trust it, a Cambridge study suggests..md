  Millennials used to like democracy. Now, most don't trust it, a Cambridge study suggests. 
description: > 
  A new study from the University of Cambridge has found that millennials are more disillusioned with democracy than generations were before them.Fifty-five percent of millennials — compared to 45% of Generation X’ers and a small minority of Baby Boomers surveyed at the same age — are unhappy with democracy.The distrust in democracy, researchers said, is linked largely to “economic exclusion” — specifically employment rates for young people and inequality.Studies have found significant gaps in wealth between Millennials and older generations, a key factor in these findings.Generational divide:Millennials lag older generations in the amount of expected wealth they should have, a new study showsPrior to the 2008 financial meltdown, the study found, millennials’ attitude toward democracy were more positive than that of their parents, only to decline sharply following the crisis.

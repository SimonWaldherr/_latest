 <p>     </p> <p>Pressed on what the PM means by an Australian deal with the EU, Mr&#160;Sharma&#160;told LBC: "The Australia deal is the deal that you have with countries where you are predominately working on a WTO (World Trade Organisation) basis."</p> <p>Asked if the "Australia deal" was another term for a no-deal situation, Mr&#160;Sharma&#160;said: "It depends, you can use the phrase 'no deal', but the point is there is a deal."</p> <p>Asked again, he said: "It's a question of semantics at the end of the day, sure.</p> <p>"There are two very clear approaches to this - we can either go down the route of doing the sort of arrangement that the EU has with Australia, the other is that we can do it down the Canada route.</p> <p>"Now that has been our preference."</p> <p>Asked whether the Government should stop using the term Australia-style deal, Mr Sharma said: "No I don't think we should stop saying Australia. People will understand very clearly what it means."</p> <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> MP Neil Coyle accused the Government of treating the public as "stupid". </p> <p>He tweeted: "The Government thinks people won&#8217;t spot the failure to get the &#8216;oven-ready&#8217; deal, or any deal at all.</p> <p>"Ministers think people don&#8217;t realise how far away Australia is, or know that most of our trade is done with our immediate neighbours.</p> <p>"The Government thinks people are stupid."&#160;</p> <p>Trade negotiations between Brussels and the UK have floundered in recent days, with Downing Street calling time on talks on Friday.</p> <p>If a deal is not agreed by the end of the Brexit transition period in December, the British businesses faces similar imposition of tariffs on goods.</p> <p> Brexit&#160;negotiators Lord Frost and Michel Barnier are expected to speak on Monday after Cabinet Office Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-gove">Michael Gove</a> said the door was "ajar" for trade talks to resume. </p> <p>But businesses are being urged to step up preparations for a no-deal exit as the prospect of an agreement hangs by a thread.</p></div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Several Conservative MPs argued against Labour's proposal, with Brendan Clarke-Smith (Bassetlaw) saying he did not believe in 'nationalising children'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told the Commons: 'Where is the slick PR campaign encouraging absent parents to take some responsibility for their children?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I do not believe in nationalising children.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Instead, we need to get back to the idea of taking responsibility, and this means less celebrity virtue-signalling on Twitter by proxy and more action to tackle the real causes of child poverty.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tory David Simmonds (Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner) also said: 'What does it say about the Opposition's priorities that all of their interests are simply swept aside in favour of currying favour with wealth and power and celebrity status, spending taxpayers' money to curry favour with celebrity status, wealth and power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Now I have no doubt that Mr Rashford is an expert in his own experience, but we should not forget that the experiences he so movingly described took place under a Labour government then supposedly at the peak of its powers in tackling child poverty in this country.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tory minister Paul Scully also told the BBC that 'children have been going hungry under a Labour government for years' and insisted the Government had been tackling the issue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Conservative Mr Halfon urged the Government to continue providing meals over the holidays while the coronavirus crisis was ongoing and called on ministers to work with Rashford.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The footballer continued: 'I don't have the education of a politician, many on Twitter have made that clear today, but I have a social education having lived through this and having spent time with the families and children most affected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'These children matter.

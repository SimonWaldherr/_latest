<p>As reported by <a href="https://collider.com/jurassic-world-3-dominion-start-of-new-era-franchise/?utm_campaign=collidersocial&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter">Collider</a>, that&#8217;s pretty much what Frank Marshall, producer of Jurassic World: Dominion, said when asked about the future of the franchise. Specifically, the publication asked him if the upcoming third <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/new-jurassic-world-short-shows-just-how-screwed-the-hum-1838144002">Jurassic World</a> movie was planned as the last in the franchise, to which he said, no. </p> <p id="ad-slot-mrec-content-mobile-1808948598" class="ad-slot ad-slot-ad-rendering ad-slot-mrec-mobile-content ad-slot-mrec ad-slot-mrec-mobile" width="320" height="250"></p>
 
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the start of a new era,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The dinosaurs are now on the mainland amongst us, and they will be for quite some time I hope.&#8221; </p><p>Finally, the true world of the dinosaurs begins! I&#8217;m hoping the upcoming Dominion, which will feature returning stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard alongside <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/well-uh-there-it-is-the-heroes-of-jurassic-park-are-1838440097">returning franchise players</a> Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum, just further escalates the integration between dinosaurs and mankind. I&#8217;m eager to see dinosaur bodegas, dinosaur suburbs, dinosaur representation at the United Nations. They&#8217;re here, by God, and it&#8217;s time we adapted to them. After all, they were in the world first. </p><p>It&#8217;s unclear, though, what the new era will look like from a filmmaking point of view. Pratt and Howard aren&#8217;t signed on for any movies after this third one, which means that the future of Jurassic films might find new stars. And, of course, a failed movie could spell doom to the whole enterprise. </p><p>As for Jurassic World: Dominion, it was in production when the coronavirus hit, so its status is uncertain. When the film, directed and co-written by Colin Trevorrow, does come, here&#8217;s hoping for a dinosaur revolution. </p> </div>

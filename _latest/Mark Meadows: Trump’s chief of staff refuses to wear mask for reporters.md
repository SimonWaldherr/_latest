Donald Trump’s chief of staff refused to talk to reporters with his mask on and stormed off when asked to wear one on Monday.

Mark Meadows was set to be interviewed by journalists at the Capitol during Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination hearing.

Mr Meadows moved a microphone stand away from the group of journalists and as he took his mask off said: “I’m more than 10 feet away, that way I can take this off.”

When he was then asked by a reporter to cover his face, he put on the mask and stalked off.

“I’m not going to talk through a mask,” Mr Meadows told the group.

Mr Meadows earlier wore a mask as he sat inside the Senate hearing room.

Mr Trump returned to the White House last week after hospital treatment at Walter Reed for the coronavirus.

The White House has not made public the results of any coronavirus tests for Mr Trump. It is unclear if he is still contagious or not.

A string of White House staffers, including close aides Hope Hicks and Stephen Miller, have also tested positive for coronavirus.

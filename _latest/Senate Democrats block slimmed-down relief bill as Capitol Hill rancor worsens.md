  Senate Democrats block slimmed-down relief bill as Capitol Hill rancor worsens 
description: > 
  McConnell and Senate GOP leaders largely oppose a giant new spending bill in the range of $2 trillion which President Trump has been demanding and Pelosi has been negotiating with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.ADADThe legislation “would move us past Speaker Pelosi’s all-or-nothing obstruction and deliver huge support right now for the most pressing needs of our country,” McConnell said ahead of the vote.That really is going to be up to whether the president can convince Mitch McConnell to do so," Pelosi said in an interview on Sirius XM radio.“I’m more working with Speaker Pelosi right now trying to get her to be reasonable,” Meadows added.“Once we get a deal there, hopefully we’ll be able to discuss the merits with our Senate colleagues.”Some Senate Republicans said it was unclear why exactly Meadows came up to Capitol Hill after lawmakers have made their views well known on another stimulus bill.

The bill includes new money for small businesses, schools, health care systems and the unemployed, but omits Democratic priorities such as state and local aid -- as well as $1,200 stimulus checks for individuals supported by Trump.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The legislation &#8220;would move us past Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s all-or-nothing obstruction and deliver huge support right now for the most pressing needs of our country,&#8221; McConnell said ahead of the vote.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

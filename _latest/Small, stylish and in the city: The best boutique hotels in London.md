  Small, stylish and in the city: The best boutique hotels in London 
description: > 
  The Henrietta, situated on one of Covent Garden's most attractive streets, has an easy going and nicely wacky feel to it.There is a difference in feel between the ground floor, given over to drinking and dining (Valentin Pouzet is in charge of the food) plus an intimate mezzanine area, and the 18 bedrooms.All are designed by Doroth√©e Meilichzon, but the former is calmer and more sober, while the bedrooms are highly unusual and hard to categorise.The hotel is owned by four Frenchmen, three of them childhood friends, who own and run the Paris-based Experimental Group.

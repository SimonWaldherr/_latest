The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has approved the £780million joint venture deal between the UK division of Carlsberg and Wolverhampton brewing giant Marston's.

It judged that the deal would not adversely affect competition in the beer and cider industry, particularly among independent brewers and wholesalers.

The agreement between the two companies would create the new Carlsberg Marston's Brewing Company (CMBC), with Carlsberg UK owning 60 per cent and being able to sell their drinks in Marston's 1,400 pubs and bars.

The proposed joint venture deal would see the Wolverhampton-based firm Marston's join forces with the UK division of the world's fourth-largest brewer

This means pints of Danish Pilsner, Tuborg and Somersby Original Cider could be served alongside glasses of Wychwood Hobgoblin, Pedigree Amber Ale and Revisionist Craft Lager.

In turn, Marston's will receive a £273million upfront payment from Carlsberg, which it has said will go towards reducing their debts and give them greater ability to focus on their pubs and accommodation business.

Tomasz Blawat, Carlsberg UK's managing director, said: 'Today's decision is a significant milestone in the formation of the new company, which we believe will create significant value for employees, customers and beer-drinkers in the UK, and we look forward to moving to the next stage on this journey.'

The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of October, three months after the CMA began its investigation into the deal.

Among the factors the public body considered was whether Marston's would sell more Carlsberg products at the expense of independent brewers.

It reckoned though that as Marston's pubs constitute 'only a small part' of the potential customer base for brewers, smaller brands would still have 'sufficient' ability to sell their goods to other pubs.

Marston's brands include Hobgoblin, Ringwood, Wainwright and Pedigree Amber Ale

It drew a similar opinion about the combined companies' wholesale operations, saying that brewers will have sufficient alternative wholesalers to choose from after the deal.

Finally, the CMA determined that Marston's primarily focuses on selling ales while Carlsberg's business is more concentrated on lagers, making competition limited between the pair of them.

'They also face several competitors in all of the product categories where they are both active,' it added. 'The CMA's investigation has therefore concluded that the deal does not give rise to competition concerns.'

The CMA partly approved the deal, because it said Carlsberg focuses more on selling lagers while Marston's concentrates more on ales, making competition limited between the pair

The joint venture arrangement comes at a challenging time for pubs and brewers, which were hit by the closure of hospitality venues in late March and a tumble in sales and footfall after they were allowed to reopen in July.

To aid recovery, the government introduced the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme to encourage customers to visit restaurants and pubs.

Diners ended up eating 100 million meals under the initiative, which gave them half-price discounts of up to £10 on food and soft drinks.

Following the end of the scheme though, new local lockdown measures, a 10pm curfew on English pubs, and an impending two-week ban on serving alcohol indoors in Scottish pubs and restaurants have caused anger in the hospitality industry.

The chief executive of trade body Hospitality UK, Kate Nicholls, warned this week that such restrictions could cause as many as 560,000 jobs in the sector to be permanently lost by the end of the year.

Nonetheless, Anna Barnfather and Andrew Wilkinson of investment bank Liberum believe Marston's can weather this downturn, because few of its sites are located in major metropolitan areas.

They write: 'The estate is well invested and benefits from having the lowest London city centre exposure compared to its pub peers. It focuses on managing suburban, family and community-focused pub estate, with no exposure to travel hubs.

'Its broad mix of food-led and wet-led pubs will help the recovery with poor visibility on trading conditions ahead.

'Further restrictions and lockdowns will likely dampen short-term performance, especially in Scotland and the North of England, however, Marston's is well-placed to navigate this disruption given its broad national portfolio and by the reduction in competition.'

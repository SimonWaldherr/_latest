Tensions reached fever pitch between Nicole Bass and Amber Turner during an explosive street row on Wednesday's episode of the Only Way Is Essex.

Nicole, 28, and Amber, 27, bumped into each other in Brentwood following an awkward exchange at a girls' spa retreat last week and attempted to iron things out.

However things took a dramatic turn with both women slinging personal insults at each other, as Nicole told Amber she is 'boring' which is why her boyfriend Dan Edgar, 30, has previously been drawn to co-stars Chloe Sims and Clelia Theodorou.

Amber was quick to hit back at Nicole and Clelia, who was also present during the dramatic row, as she told them: 'You two have no personality combined, a plank of wood is more exciting!'

While strolling down the road with friend Chloe Meadows, Amber noticed Clelia stood outside a hairdressers and said: 'Oh look it's Clelia.'

Clelia acknowledged the pair and referenced Amber's feud with Nicole, and said: 'Obviously its a bit awkward, I'm waiting for Nicole come to out.'

Amber replied: 'Oh good, need to have a little chat with Nicole.'

Awkward: Nicole, 28, and Amber, 27, bumped into each other in Brentwood following an awkward exchange at a girls' spa retreat last week and attempted to iron things out

Explaining her version of events, Clelia said: 'Yeah with everything that's gone down like when she walked away you slagged her off.'

Nicole previously tried to address comments Amber had made about her when she admitted she was 'wary' of her due to her rocky friendship with Yazmin Oukhellou.

Broaching the subject of their feud, Amber said: 'Oh here she is! I feel like we need to have a little conversation just to air our problems and get it all out on the table, so we can all move on with our lives. I know you think I slagged you off, but the thing is if I had a problem with you you'd know about it.'

While Nicole responded: 'What it is with me is that yeah I was wary of you, and it's not just because of Yazmin, you've got to understand that over the year I've seen Yazmin upset and on the other end of the phone over you. Numerous people are always upset over you.'

Ouch! However things took a dramatic turn with both women slinging personal insults at each other, as Nicole told Amber she is 'boring' which is why her boyfriend Dan Edgar, 30, has previously been drawn to co-stars Chloe Sims and Clelia Theodorou

Savage: Amber was quick to hit back at Nicole and Clelia, who was also present during the dramatic row, as she told them: 'You two have no personality combined, a plank of wood is more exciting!'

Clearly irked by her comment, Amber said: 'But these people aren't my friends! I'm not being funny but you can't sit and say they're upset over me. Why are they so bothered.'

Nicole appears unhappy at being interrupted, and said: 'Let me finish.'

While Amber injected: 'Why are they so bothered?'

Oh hey! While strolling down the road with friend Chloe Meadows, Amber noticed Clelia stood outside a hairdressers and said: 'Oh look it's Clelia'

And Nicole then demanded: 'Just shush!'

Scoffing at the comment, Amber then replied: 'Oh she went there!'

Referring to their awkward evening at the spa, Chloe said: 'You were rude to us, we would have been fine with you. And now you've put Yaz in a really horrible position.'

However Clelia hit back: 'She hasn't put her in a horrible position, Yazmin put her in one! She calls her and complains about you guys all the time.'

Here she is: Clelia acknowledged the pair and referenced Amber's feud with Nicole, and said: 'Obviously its a bit awkward, I'm waiting for Nicole come to out'

Chloe jumped in and questioned: 'As her friend why are you bringing that up and using it against her?'

Keen to address a wider issue, Amber said: 'For me there's underlying problems, I don't know if you're jealous that me and Yaz are friends because me Dan, Yaz and Lockie do a lot together. So I can understand why you'd get a bit p****d off about that?'

Unimpressed, Clelia said: 'Drop pulling the jealously thing Amber thing please! Don't say that. Amber, who do you think you are right now? F***ing unbelievable this girl.'

Clearly irked by her comment, Amber said: 'But these people aren't my friends! I'm not being funny but you can't sit and say they're upset over me. Why are they so bothered'

Nicole insisted: 'I have absolutely no reason to be jealous of you!'

However Amber seemed unsure and said: 'You seem to be, that's the only thing that's come across. We were never friends.'

Reaching boiling point, Nicole said: 'Yeah but you're horrible to Yazmin all the time! You slag her off and then go on holiday and then make the f**king girl cry. So she's ringing me up!'

Amber appeared confused and question: 'Cry!?'

Nicole exclaimed: 'Mate you don't have a clue about anything.'

Nicole appears unhappy at being interrupted, and said: 'Let me finish'

Amber replied: 'Nothing is ever going to change, we're never going to be friends, we never have been. You sit there with your mates talking about me.'

Nicole snapped: 'You talk about everybody!'

While Amber said: 'You have the cheek to talk about my personality, you two have no personality combined, a plank of wood is more exciting.'

A shocked Clelia jumped in and said: 'Are you talking about me! Bye. Have fun. Be a bitch to everyone like you always are.'

Opinion: Referring to their awkward evening at the spa, Chloe said: 'You were rude to us, we would have been fine with you. And now you've put Yaz in a really horrible position'

Keen to address a wider issue, Amber said: 'For me there's underlying problems, I don't know if you're jealous that me and Yaz are friends because me Dan, Yaz and Lockie do a lot together. So I can understand why you'd get a bit p****d off about that?'

As Amber walked off, Nicole shouted after her: 'Dan got with Chloe Sims and Clelia cos you're a boring b***h yourself. That's why your boyfriend wants other girls honey.'

During time apart from Amber, Dan dated Clelia in 2018 during the same time she joined the ITVBe reality show. Dan also enjoyed a romance with their co-star Chloe Sims in 2019 during a cast trip to Thailand before rekindling with Amber.

Clelia added: 'She drives me insane that girl.'

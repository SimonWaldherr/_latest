<div><p>In invoking &#8220;One Nation&#8221;, he aimed to turn the Tories&#8217; rhetoric against them - though Disraeli probably didn&#8217;t envisage the equal sharing of misery.</p>
<p>Doubly unhelpfully for advocates of Starmer&#8217;s &#8216;strictly time-limited&#8217; approach, Nicola Sturgeon has just extended Scotland&#8217;s two-week &#8216;circuit breaker&#8217; another week.</p>
<p>It also didn&#8217;t help that the PM was on belligerent form, taking every opportunity to kick the Khan down the road. If the Mayor of London had been a punchbag, he would have been battered to a pulp by the end of PMQs. Mr Johnson greeted even glancing references to TfL or the continued closure of Hammersmith Bridge with the gung-ho enthusiasm of Master Rashford facing an open goal.</p>
<p>The whirling haymakers began the moment Catherine West (Labour, Lewisham East) bewailed the prospect of Congestion Tax being forced onto 4 million extra Londoners already facing the Double Whammy of Covid and financial ruin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Current Mayor of London had effectively bankrupted TFL before coronavirus had even hit and left a massive black hole in its finances,&#8221; roared the PM, every inch the defiant general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any expansion of the congestion charge is entirely the responsibility of the BANKRUPT current LABOUR Mayor of London.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any London transport-related question, however disobliging, received the same response. Over 60s deprived of free travel? Barnes residents facing a &#163;15 a day car charge? It&#8217;s all the fault of that pesky Mayor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/17/london-deserves-great-statesman-charge-instead-has-sadiq-khan/">Sadiq-bashing</a> is a favourite blood sport of Londoners&#160;everywhere: played with friends, neighbours, and especially vigorously in black cabs. So these were fatally overpitched deliveries, easily knocked for six even by a batsman with a lacklustre recent average.</p>
<p>From then on, political jargon flooded the chamber. &#8220;How can we help female grassroots sport build back better?&#8221; asked one Tory MP. Another praised the PM&#8217;s "commitment to doubling down on levelling up&#8221;, surely the result of an office bet to see how much politician-speak could fit into a single sentence.</p>
<p>Was it the language, or simply the lack of any real opposition? Whatever the cause, I was reduced to despair. What should have been a massacre turned out like a tea-party. A plague on both their houses.&#160;</p>

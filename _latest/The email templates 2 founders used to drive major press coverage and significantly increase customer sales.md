                                    <p>Before launching Unique Markets in 2008, CEO and founder Sonja Rasula moved to Los Angeles from Canada to star as a TV personality and design expert on TLC's "Trading Spaces." But soon after being hired, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/profiles-strategies/2015/02/when-her-tv-dreams-died-sonja-rasula-founded.html?page=all">she was fired</a> (which Rasula believes is because the <a href="https://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/sonja-rasula">show didn't do well</a> &#8212; it only aired for a few episodes). So, she instead decided to risk her entire 401(k) savings to self-fund Unique Markets as a way to bring locally made design, artists, and brands to mass shoppers.</p><p>Rasula has since featured over 10,000 small businesses, generating over $25 million for these brands, and surpassed the million-dollar mark with her own small business in 2014. In the beginning, however, without a budget for PR, Rasula personally reached out to press to announce the launch of her company with this email template, which landed her features in the Los Angeles Times, Eater, LA Weekly, and the now-defunct Daily Candy, in addition to partnership requests from big-name brands like Yelp and Etsy.&#160;</p><p>Hello [name],</p><p>I've been following your [column/events calendar/articles/blog] and really liked your recent post about [topic/article they recently published]. I think you'd like to know about a project I'm working on: I'm launching a brand-new shopping event called Unique Markets in downtown Los Angeles on December 7 and 8 at the California Market Center. The first of its kind in the country, the indoor pop-up marketplace will feature 225 curated artists and designers. I personally think you would like [names and links to three designers/companies featured that are relevant].</p><p>&#160;I'm starting the marketplace to help showcase all of the amazing talent this city has and to make it easy for people to shop local and support the local economy. You can read more about the event here [URL]. I'd love for you to write about Unique Markets, perhaps as an event listing or as an article about local artists and the growing creative economy in Los Angeles.&#160;</p><p>I have high-resolution photography and all the details in a press release that I can share with you, if interested. I would love to talk with you about this exciting new venture! Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks so much for your time.&#160;</p><p>&#160;Sonja Rasula</p><p>[email address]</p><p>Rasula's key strategy was to personalize each email for the intended recipient. "I would research each writer and editor before sending," she said. "If the writer was a food writer, I would give three examples of participants that made packaged food/gift items. If I were contacting the editor of a d&#233;cor blog, then I would mention three related people, like a furniture maker, pillow designer, and an illustrator that makes framed art."</p><p>Rasula kept her emails short and sweet at just three small paragraphs and always provided suggestions for how her product or service could fit into their work.</p><p>"Never attach files or images because most attachments get auto-blocked, so your email may never make it," Rasula said. "And the devil is in details, so always triple check that you've spelled their name correctly."&#160;</p>

<div><p><i><strong>Footfairy, written and directed by Kanishk Varma, revolves around the mysterious serial killings happening in Mumbai and CBI&#8217;s Vivaan Deshmukh&#8217;s (Gulshan Devaiah) attempts to nab the killer. But, instead of going for a thrilling cat-and-mouse chase vibe, Varma displays the tiring nature of such cases, how it spills into one&#8217;s personal life, and how ignorant an entire city stays despite the heinous nature of the crime. The movie is paced beautifully, the writing is compact, and is held together masterfully by an effortless Devaiah.</strong></i></p>

<p>I think we can all agree that David Fincher and Bong Joon-ho (Two directors that <i>Footfairy</i> tips its hat to) has given some of the best serial killer centric crime-thriller movies of the past few decades in the form of <i>Seven</i>, <i>Zodiac</i>, <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i>, <i>Memories of a Murder</i>, and <i>Mother</i>. But ever since they moved on to different genres, I think there has been a general sentiment that this particular sub-category has begun to tank. Well, as a fan, of course, I think the situation is quite the opposite because we&#8217;ve got <i>Prisoners</i>, <i>Article 15</i>, <i>Raman Raghav 2.0</i>, <i>Mardaani</i>, which have not fallen into the trappings of the genre. Instead, they&#8217;ve enriched it by commenting on how these cases deform the definition of the justice system and the people who are involved in it, and how nothing is an open-and-shut case anymore. <i>Footfairy</i> is a decent addition to this list.</p>

<p class="vplayer"></p>

<p><i>Footfairy</i> is written and directed by Kanishk Varma. The cinematography is by Pratik Deora, editing by Sumit Purohit, dialogues by Ashish Prakash Verma, costume design by Shivank Kapoor and Jewellyn Alvares, production design by Ajay Jadhav, action direction by Faiyaz Sayed, and sound design by Avinash Sonavane. It stars Gulshan Devaiah, Kunaal Roy Kapur, Sagarika Ghatge, Ashish Pathode, Karan Arvind Bendre, Yogesh Soman, Muskan Bamne, Payal Thapa, and more. The story is centered around Vivaan Deshmukh (Devaiah) who is heading a case about a serial killer that murders young women, cuts off their feet, and puts them on display by stuffing them in a trolley bag and putting it near a railway station. Deshmukh, along with his partners Harish (Ashish) and Rishabh (Karan), tries everything in his power to bring the case to a close before more lives are taken but only ends up going in circles.</p>

<h3>Kanishk Varma&#8217;s writing is obsessed with the various impacts of the serial killings than the serial killings itself.</h3>
<p>I am going to be very honest, for some reason I was expecting <i>Footfairy</i> to be this quirky and forgettable movie about a killer with a foot fetish. It&#8217;s probably a personal thing but a movie called <i>Footfairy</i> didn&#8217;t really convince me that it&#8217;s going to be a serious analysis of the absurdity and normality that swirls around such inexplicable crimes. But we&#8217;ll come to that later. Varma presents Vivaan as our point-of-view character who comes off as fairly confident, friendly, self-aware, charming, you know, the stereotypical modern Bollywood hero. And even though he&#8217;s unpacking a seemingly unsolvable case, you feel sure that he&#8217;s going to solve it, get the girl, and walk off into the sunset. However, the serial killer advertently or inadvertently finds his key (Those who&#8217;ve watched <a href="/entertainment/17696/filmsplaining-how-mike-flanagan-distracts-to-evoke-fear-in-the-haunting-of-bly-manor" target="_blank"><i>The Haunting of Bly Manor</i></a> will know) and completely crumbles him. Therefore, whether this &#8220;witty&#8221; man will sink or swim becomes the more interesting question instead of &#8220;who is the serial killer?&#8221;.</p>

<p>In doing so, Varma makes a much larger commentary about how the society is nonchalant about the rot festering right underneath their feet until it reaches them. We see Vivaan joking with Harish after analysing a crime scene. We see Vivaan and Devika talking about serial killers as though they are these mythical figures that just happen to walk among us. We see Vivaan and Harish referring to semen samples as &#8220;semen <i>ka</i> tsunami&#8221; while trying to apprehend a suspect. And we see Vivaan and Devika talking about the killer&#8217;s alleged foot fetish in a flippant manner. All that reflects the city&#8217;s approach to the topic i.e. it&#8217;s worth a water-cooler discussion. But as Vivaan&#8217;s boundaries start to get smaller and smaller, he starts to waver, become more aggressive, and he even loses his cool. That devolution shows two things: how we have romanticised crime and yet how vulnerable we are once we see the details for ourselves.</p>

<h3>Kanishk Varma&#8217;s direction makes <i>Footfairy</i> an engaging watch but he needed to go a little harder on the noir vibes.</h3>
<p>Given how I was talking about the macroscopic commentary that Varma does through the narrative, let me talk about it a little more in terms of how he does the same visually. The movie features a bunch of these time-lapse shots of the city in order to transition from one day to another, shots of the traffic, shots of faceless people working. And initially, I thought that it was to show the passage of time or they were just arbitrary in nature to pad up the runtime. But eventually, they took on a larger meaning. It showed how Mumbai never came to a stand-still. If it was a part of the narrative, I am sure Varma, Deora, and Purohit could&#8217;ve got some early morning or very late night footage of the city and edited them in a way to show how devastated the city is. However, they intentionally show how unaffected it is, thereby increasing the helplessness of the overall situation. I think that&#8217;s neat.</p>

<p>Barring a few jarring editing choices, possibly due to the lack of coverage on the shoot day (This is just speculation), the movie is immersive. It&#8217;s two-hours long and it never gets boring although there aren&#8217;t a lot of over-the-top surprising revelations that Bollywood movies and shows hailing from this sub-genre usually rely on. The score might be a little overwhelming at times but it stops being so and starts to compliment the somber tone of the story. The rain-drenched sequences, the set design, the slow-burn pacing, the rhythm of the character interactions, the consequential nature of everyone&#8217;s actions, all add to the weight of <i>Footfairy</i>. But somewhere inside me, I felt that Varma should&#8217;ve gone full tilt on all those aspects. I kept feeling that he was holding back. He should&#8217;ve upped the muddy chase sequences, mirrored Vivaan&#8217;s devolving psyche by making him look more and more disheveled, upped the contrast to make everything look grimier and ickier. Since it doesn&#8217;t, it failed to satisfy me by a notch.</p>

<h3>Gulshan Devaiah&#8217;s effortlessness as Vivaan Deshmukh is sometimes baffling and inspiring.</h3>
<p>I think I have used the phrase &#8220;sinking one&#8217;s teeth into a role&#8221; too much. How about &#8220;devouring a role so that the actor becomes the character&#8221;? Does that sound alright? Because that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ll define Devaiah&#8217;s performance. We don&#8217;t get a lot of backstory for Vivaan. Just a few visual cues and hints during conversations. But it feels like Devaiah has really lived as Vivaan, is still doing so, and will keep doing so. He shows that through his dialogue delivery as he spews out technical jargon like he has years of knowledge about criminal studies just stored in the back of his mind. His body language is professional and a welcome sight after seeing the hundreds of buffed-up actors who try to depict policemen and other Government officials as superheroes and not these broken down human beings who are in that profession because of the darkness within them. His non-verbal acting is as good, especially during a very pivotal revelation. I know that sounds complex but Devaiah makes it look all like &#8220;<i>ye toh kuch nahi hai</i>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Coming to the supporting cast, everyone basically does their job well. Although Sagarika and Kunaal are big names, please don&#8217;t go in expecting a lot from them. They aren&#8217;t in the movie for too long. The two people who did grab my attention when Devaiah wasn&#8217;t were Ashish Pathode and Payal Thapa. Pathode&#8217;s role is almost equal to Devaiah&#8217;s and it&#8217;s his reactions to Vivaan&#8217;s actions that remind us that they&#8217;re living in a world where there are consequences and extrajudicial power isn&#8217;t something that you can wave around. Thapa&#8217;s role is smaller than that but she represents the fear and anguish that people on the ground are feeling that you won&#8217;t get to see from those aerial shots. She&#8217;s the first and only character who knows the dangerous nature of the Footfairy. The rest of the victims were unaware of it. And she does it so well while highlighting the subtext of her character&#8217;s existence that I cannot help but laud her. So yeah, well done.</p>

<h3>Final verdict.</h3>
<p>The trailers for <i>Footfairy</i> don&#8217;t do it justice. It&#8217;s a much better movie than it appears to be. It&#8217;s introspective in nature, especially because it looks like Varma knows that he is dipping into a genre that has a magnanimous history, and its slow pace allows the audience to feel all that weight and thereby look underneath its surface. It features a brilliant performance from Gulshan Devaiah. I think it cheapens itself with that post-credit scene and by revealing the actor who has played the on-screen Footfairy. I think that it could&#8217;ve gone harder with its neo-noir, grungy aesthetic. But since it kept me engrossed and at the edge-of-my seat for two hours straight, I&#8217;ll definitely recommend <i>Footfairy</i> to crime-thriller fans and film fans in general.</p>

<p><i>Footfairy</i> will stream on AndPictures from October 24.</p>

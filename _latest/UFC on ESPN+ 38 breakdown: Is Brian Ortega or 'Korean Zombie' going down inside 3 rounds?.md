Considering each fighter’s deadly acumen from the front-headlock position, I will be curious to see how eager either party will be in regards to pursuing takedowns.

Although the stats will tell you that Jung has a slightly higher propensity to initiate takedowns in fights, I’m of the belief that Ortega is the more likely man to shoot from both a styles and trends perspective (as I warn anyone who lives and dies by on-paper statistics). But regardless of whether or not I’m right, I suspect that even Ortega may think twice before changing his level in the open.

Although he carries no official rank in jiu-jitsu, Jung is a treacherous transitional threat who can turn the tide of a fight off of just one bad shot.

Predicating most of his offense from the front-headlock position, Jung has a plethora of front-choke threats that he can chain to back-takes, which is ultimately another position where the Korean fighter comes to life from. However, given that the submission realm is a place where his current opposition tends to stage comebacks from, then perhaps Jung may be hesitant to engage himself.

By now, the secret has long been out on the grappling phenom from the Gracie Torrance academy. As we saw in Ortega’s first few fights under the UFC banner, his transitional grappling was already at a very high level, displaying a deceptive process to his jiu-jitsu prowess.

Not afraid to fight from his back, Ortega has little issue in succeeding position off of failed takedown attempts or even going for high-risk attacks. And should his opponents follow the Gracie black belt to the floor, they often get more than they bargained for.

Bearing a submission game that can make you feel like you’re fighting a mythological Hydra, Ortega can turn calm waters into sea storms in a flash.

Once inside of Ortega’s grasp, the Gracie fighter immediately goes to work by giving his opposition multiple problems to deal with while chaining from submission to submission, even altering positional terms when applicable. In Ortega’s last fight opposite an elite striker in Max Holloway, we saw him get after grappling opportunities a lot more than usual, as I would not be surprised to see efforts funneled in a similar direction for this fight.

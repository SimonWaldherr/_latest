 <p>     </p> <p>Even the end of the notorious Serious Anti Robbery Squad, SARS, suspected of murder, extortion and torturing suspects has failed to stop a country teetering towards revolt.</p> <p>And with the world watching Lagos burn, the youth movement &#8211; mostly 18-24 year-olds &#8211; has attracted global support.</p> <p>United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres confirmed there had been "multiple deaths," urging the authorities to de-escalate the situation.</p> <p>In London protesters gathered at the Nigerian High Commission and show business and sports stars have added their name to calls for the Nigerian government to answer demands.</p> <p><strong>What is your view?

<p>     </p> <p>The main appeal is for police reforms beyond the disbanding of the SARS police group and for an overhaul of the entire Nigerian home domestic security system.</p> <p>Nigeria's young want better education, job prospects and are even mobilising against Nigeria's unreliable infrastructure in an escalating push against the government.</p> <p>Supporters of the protests include <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> founder Jack Dorsey, rapper <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>, Star Wars actor John Boyega, footballers Mesut Ozila, Marcus Rashford.</p> <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/odion-ighalo-nigeria-government-killers-22882165">Manchester United's Odion Ihhalo supports the uprising</a>, as has Chelsea's Reece James and Leicester's Kelechi Ihenanacho and Wilfred Ndidi.</p>

 <p>Boxer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anthony-joshua">Anthony Joshua</a> has also announced his support and Everton's Alex Owobi tweeted a bloodstained Nigeria flag.</p> <p>Singer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/beyonce">Beyonce</a> has said she is &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; over the &#8220;senseless brutality.</p> <p>Fires are burning across Lagos, with increasing police checkpoints and police stations torched by protesters enraged by police brutality.</p> <p>The protests have morphed into a message of general hatred of a corrupt and authoritarian police, unemployment and little opportunity for the troubled country's young.</p>

 <p>Nigeria's average age is 18 and with half of its citizens are under 30 it makes a general uprising seem ever more possible against the authorities who face corruption allegations.</p> <p>More than a third of Nigeria's 15-34 year-olds are unemployed with little prospect of a job, its cities hit by sporadic electricity and complaints of a poorly serviced education system.</p> <p>And with the growing youth movement against the government not having a leader there is no figure for the Nigerian police to target.</p> <p>Last night Lagos, with 14 million residents, was under round-the-clock curfew as more gunfire rang out across the city fires raging throughout.</p>

 <p>A small number of British troops stationed across Nigeria on missions to train local forces on how to tackle terrorism is on high-alert for the violence to escalate even further.</p> <p>As President Muhammadu Buhari appealed for "understanding and calm", Amnesty International was investigating &#8220;excessive use of force occasioning deaths of protesters."</p> <p>Witnesses said soldiers had fired and at least two people had been shot.</p> <p>Two of the witnesses said the gate's lights were turned before the shooting began.</p>

 <p>Witnesses described being shot at by soldiers.</p> <p>Inyene Akpan, 26, a photographer, said more than 20 soldiers arrived at the toll gate and opened fire.</p> <p>Witness Akinbosola Ogunsanya said he saw around 10 people being shot, and soldiers removing bodies.</p> <p>Another witness, Chika Dibia, said soldiers hemmed in people as they shot at them.</p>

 <p>One said he saw soldiers remove bodies.</p> <p>Lagos state governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu said 30 people were hurt in the shooting during a demonstration at a toll gate in the Lekki district on Tuesday night.</p> <p>It has become a focal point of nearly two weeks of nationwide protests.</p> <p>The Nigerian Army said no soldiers were at the scene, despite many social media posts claiming there were soldiers and that they were shooting.</p>

 <p>Yesterday fires were burning across Lagos and residents throughout the city reported gunfire. <br>Police - some armed, some wearing body armour and many in plain clothes - <br>set up roadblocks across Lagos.</p> <p>Witnesses saw youths trying to get through some checkpoints, and reported gatherings in some areas.</p> <p>A live feed from local broadcaster Arise TV showed armed police speaking to groups of angry locals, and dozens of charred buses on the Lagos mainland.</p>

 <p>In South Africa, hundreds of Nigerians carrying placards demanding "a new and better Nigeria" marched to the Nigerian High Commission in Pretoria.</p> <p>Nigerian authorities imposed the curfew on Lagos on Tuesday after the governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the protests had turned violent, including the torching police stations across the city.</p> <p>Thousands of Nigerians have been driven closer to poverty by economic fallout from a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> pandemic that has infected more 60,000, killed 1,125 and triggered springtime lockdowns.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>It triggered even more resentment towards the SAR unit, which rights groups for years accused of extortion, harassment, torture and murders and was disbanded on Oct. 11.</p> <p>And all President Buhari could do to try and placate the protesters was issue promises of justice for victims of brutality, and that police reforms were coming &#8211; despite the demands being years old.</p></div>

<p>The remarks echo statements from current chair Jerome Powell and regional Fed presidents. Officials have repeatedly urged Congress to approve new aid, emphasizing the Fed's ability to lend, not spend.</p><p>Yet months of talks between Democrats and the White House yielded little progress. The two parties remain stuck in negotiations despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi imposing on Sunday a 48-hour deadline for talks. Even if the White House reaches a compromise with House Democrats, Senate Republicans are poised to kill the bill.</p><p>Yellen also repeated Powell's warnings that the path of the US recovery hinges on its containment of the coronavirus. While President Donald Trump continues to downplay the virus and praise a V-shaped bounce-back, his Fed chair has cautioned that a resurgence of COVID-19 cases could derail the economic rebound.</p><p>Efforts including increased testing, contact tracing, and mask-wearing will play a critical role in bringing the US back to pre-pandemic levels of growth, Yellen said.</p><p>"We need a much more effective effort than we've had. If we had that it would be good not only for health but for being able to open up the economy, and we've seen that in countries ranging from Germany to Korea to China that have been successful," she said. &#13;

LeBron James already has his motivation for next season — even if he isn’t exactly sure of the source yet.

James continued his well-earned victory tour on Instagram late Monday night, calling out the next batch of people who will question him after he won his fourth title with his third team on Sunday night.

“WHAT THEY GONE SAY NOW?!?!” James wrote on Instagram with a picture of him smoking a cigar. “I know they’ll make up another criteria that nobody else has ever had in the history of the game. But Guess what though, bring it on please!! Heavy is the head that holds the 👑 they say. Let’s get it! #ThekidfromAKRON🤴🏾 #RevengeSZNCompleted😉”

James won NBA Finals MVP after leading the Lakers — with Anthony Davis — to the championship in a six-game triumph over a feisty Heat team. Davis, who does have an opt-out, seems likely to return as the Lakers will look to defend their title in what should be a stacked Western Conference next season.

The cigar post was just the latest in a whirlwind amount of Instagram content — mostly in story form — from James that chronicled the Lakers’ title celebration to his return home after finally leaving the NBA bubble in Orlando.

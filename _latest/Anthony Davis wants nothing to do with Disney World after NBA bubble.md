Anthony Davis is a champion, but he is not going (back) to Disney World any time soon.

After helping the Lakers win the NBA title Sunday night, Davis was freed from the bubble on the campus of Disney World and plans on staying as far away from there as long as possible.

“Probably not. Not for at least two years,” Davis said Tuesday on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” when asked if he would ever go to Disney World again. “We were even talking about boycotting playing the Orlando Magic for a while.”

The Lakers arrived in the bubble on July 10 and finally left Monday, three months later, upon beating the Heat in six games in the NBA Finals. The bubble, however mentally taxing it may have been, worked. The league did not record a single positive test for COVID-19.

Davis, who averaged 25 points and 10.7 rebounds per game against the Heat and can become a free agent this offseason, said the best part of being out of the bubble was being able to sleep in his own bed.

“That’s the first thing everybody did when they got home, they just went in and laid in the bed for hours,” he said. “Being able to be home and move freely without wearing masks or worrying about somebody getting tested or anything like that. So we’re able to be in our own homes and be back with our families and get some sleep in our own beds.”

Before being able to escape the bubble and sleep, though, the Lakers enjoyed a night of partying to celebrate their championship. Davis said they celebrated in their hotel rooms and also had a restaurant reserved for them.

“There’s a lot of guys who got their first championship, so we were all … in wheelchairs heading back to our hotels,” Davis said with a laugh.

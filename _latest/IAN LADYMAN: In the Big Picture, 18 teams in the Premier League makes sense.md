<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember the days when you needed 40 points to stay in the Premier League? No, I don&#8217;t either.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People still say it, though. Managers and players still talk about reaching that magical staging post that assures them of another season in the land where the money grows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it&#8217;s a myth. Nobody needs 40 points any more. Only once in the last 17 seasons &#8212; back in 2011 &#8212; has the team finishing fourth bottom required that number. The average is actually 35 points these days and often it&#8217;s even less.&#160;</p><img id="i-d6511512e40fe802" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="396" width="634" alt="Reducing the Premier League to 18 teams would be good - Norwich didn't contribute much" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-d6511512e40fe802" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/19/34542178-0-image-a-34_1603045764326.jpg" height="396" width="634" alt="Reducing the Premier League to 18 teams would be good - Norwich didn't contribute much" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Reducing the Premier League to 18 teams would be good - Norwich didn't contribute much</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So of all the self-serving drivel proposed by Liverpool and Manchester United as part of their vainglorious Project Big Picture, reducing the Premier League to 18 teams was not the worst idea. Standards in the bottom half of the table have been falling for years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What did Norwich do for us last season? Or Huddersfield the year before? Those two clubs managed 37 points and eight wins between them. Thanks for coming but just one question: Why did you bother?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Part of the reason for the slide is money spent badly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That, for example, is the reason why Fulham went down two seasons ago and why Aston Villa almost did so last year. Wasting money in the transfer market is not only the preserve of the big clubs, which is baffling given how many resources are now funnelled towards recruitment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But another, more pertinent, reason is a pure lack of ambition. One of the most memorable quotes from a Premier League executive when the league&#8217;s clubs were squabbling over how best to finish last season&#8217;s fixtures was: &#8216;Always remember that 14 clubs start every season with the same single motivation. To stay in the league.&#8217;&#160;&#160;</p><img id="i-2350e04645b89f7c" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="411" width="634" alt="Huddersfield also struggled in the Premier League and suffered relegation in 2019" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-2350e04645b89f7c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/19/34542212-0-image-a-35_1603045923677.jpg" height="411" width="634" alt="Huddersfield also struggled in the Premier League and suffered relegation in 2019" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Huddersfield also struggled in the Premier League and suffered relegation in 2019</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So rich is the Premier League, so huge the financial gap between the top division and the Championship, that far too many of our clubs set out looking down rather than up. Too few have the courage of Wolves and Sheffield United, for example.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what you end up with are a bunch of teams who only really try to take points off those around them. Tony Pulis was a master at it when he was at West Brom, for example.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Self-preservation is understandable. Relegation is financially damaging. But in terms of the quality of what we see, the impact is clear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last season Sheffield United&#8217;s Chris Wilder was surprised to find the Premier League so accommodating. He didn&#8217;t expect his team to go down but he didn&#8217;t expect them to challenge for the Champions League places, as they briefly did.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wilder, a right back in his day, was shocked at how few Premier League teams were prepared to defend properly, how few players really wanted to do the painful, hard stuff.&#160;</p><img id="i-54d9ff02bc292f7c" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="Last season Chris Wilder was surprised to find the Premier League so accommodating" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-54d9ff02bc292f7c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/19/34542106-0-image-a-33_1603045534668.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Last season Chris Wilder was surprised to find the Premier League so accommodating" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Last season Chris Wilder was surprised to find the Premier League so accommodating</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a malaise in the Premier League. No doubt about it. There is a bunch of clubs &#8212; and we know who they are &#8212; who are not prepared to aim high in case in doing so they leave themselves vulnerable to those playing the safety-first stuff beneath them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To them, 14th or 15th or 16th is good enough. Every year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Project Big Picture was a selfish act. Rarely has an idea been so disingenuously named. But not all of it was potentially ruinous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A Premier League with two fewer teams and a bit of breathing space for over-exerted players? Doesn&#8217;t sound like the worst idea to me.</p><p class="pageBreak">&#160;</p><p class="clear"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gareth Southgate's treatment of Jack Grealish is strange&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gareth Southgate&#8217;s attitude towards Jack Grealish is puzzling. If a star performance in game one of a triple header doesn&#8217;t get you a single minute of action in the next two then you may wonder why you are bothering.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this is the trap Grealish must not fall into. Southgate has reservations about him and &#8212; deliberately or otherwise &#8212; has just set the Aston Villa player a test.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A month of good form and Grealish will be in the next squad. Any signs of self-pity or ill-discipline and we may never see him in an England shirt again.</p><img id="i-be3cbc1ee76fedac" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="433" width="634" alt="England manager Gareth Southgate's treatment of Jack Grealish is rather puzzling" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-be3cbc1ee76fedac" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/19/34542010-0-image-a-31_1603045070524.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="England manager Gareth Southgate's treatment of Jack Grealish is rather puzzling" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">England manager Gareth Southgate's treatment of Jack Grealish is rather puzzling</p><p class="pageBreak">&#160;</p><p class="clear"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now I worry for Pickford's state of mind&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sometimes in this game you don&#8217;t really want to be proved right but long held reservations expressed on this page about Jordan Pickford have transpired to be well-founded.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pickford&#8217;s emotional extremes &#8212; rather than any technical issues &#8212; are his greatest problem and this is why it&#8217;s hard not to worry about him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Everton goalkeeper did not mean to injure Virgil van Dijk but news the Dutchman faces surgery places Pickford in the line of fire for every social media troll in the land.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We should all be concerned for Van Dijk.

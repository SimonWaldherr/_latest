<p class="mol-para-with-font">Why now&#8217;s the time to go digital</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a period where nearly three quarters of British bricks-and-mortar businesses report to have lost revenue due to COVID restrictions, a third of GoDaddy&#8217;s customers are expecting their businesses to thrive over the next few months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While consumer confidence in our high streets remains uncertain, shoppers have gone digital, which has given enterprising individuals as well as existing businesses the chance to expose themselves to a much larger, diverse marketplace, thus increasing their chances of making a profit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It&#8217;s a move that&#8217;s benefitting rising SMEs as much as established companies, with over 60% of consumers claiming that they&#8217;re not only using the World Wide Web to support smaller businesses, but will continue to do so after lockdown too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this brave new world of making a living may feel daunting to some. As part of their research into how they can support micro-businesses in the current climate, GoDaddy has found that for many people, the main barriers stopping them from taking the leap and launching their own businesses were lack of time, confidence and money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the future of many people&#8217;s careers remains unpredictable, it&#8217;s easy to see why there is some uncertainty around investing in a new venture. But joining the online SME community doesn&#8217;t need to cost the earth &#8211; nor does it require you to be a dab hand at technical things such as website building or online marketing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How to do business online &#8211; and succeed</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You don&#8217;t have to let any lack of business know-how or technical wizardry stop you from having a go at online business &#8211; particularly when GoDaddy has plans in place that can do all the complicated stuff for you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its <a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://uk.godaddy.com/websites-marketing">Website + Marketing ecommerce product</a>, for example, has been specifically created to support internet novices on the road to success.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This package enables you to choose your unique domain name &#8211; or website address &#8211; and offers a selection of professional looking templates, shipping and payment options. In short, all the complexities of designing a web page and tracking your sales are pre-arranged; you just need to give it your own personal touch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that&#8217;s not all it can help you with. From marketing tools to increase your visibility on search engines and social media, email facilities to help you keep in touch with your customers and inventory syncing &#8211; which automatically tracks what you have sold and what products are still available &#8211; GoDaddy supports the day-to-day running of your business, so you can learn and grow without the stress.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can really pay off, too; within 12 months, customers who signed up to GoDaddy Website + Marketing saw an average increase of 13% in revenue. Plus, with free trials available and packages starting from as little as &#163;6.99 a month, it&#8217;s a relatively low-risk investment for what could bring you big returns.</p><img id="i-3e690af94f245a5d" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="With ready-made selling platforms, GoDaddy enables you to launch your online business quickly and smoothly" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-3e690af94f245a5d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/30/12/33809324-8785749-image-a-4_1601465318990.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="With ready-made selling platforms, GoDaddy enables you to launch your online business quickly and smoothly" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">With ready-made selling platforms, GoDaddy enables you to launch your online business quickly and smoothly</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those who are a little more digitally savvy, there&#8217;s the <a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://uk.godaddy.com/help/compare-managed-wordpress-plans-27210">GoDaddy Managed WordPress product</a>.

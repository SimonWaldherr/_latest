  More than a dozen whales found dead on New Zealand beach 
description: > 
  More than a dozen whales have died after becoming stranded on New Zealand’s North Island, according to the country’s Department of Conservation.The creatures were part of a pod of around 40 pilot whales who got stranded earlier that day.Five of the whales were discovered dead late on Saturday night at a site thought to be the original stranding location, the department said.Pilot whales, which can grow to above 6m in length, are a species prone to mass beaching.It was Australia’s largest mass stranding to date, with roughly 470 pilot whales stuck in a remote harbour on Tasmania’s rugged western seaboard.

It is this tendency to form close bonds that can put the species at a disadvantage when they find themselves too close to the shore.&#160;</p><p></p><p><i>With additional reporting from agencies</i></p><p class="sc-ptCms fzKffT"></p></div>

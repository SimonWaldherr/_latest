Nicola Sturgeon is examining a travel ban between Scotland and the north of England after backing draconian cross-Border restrictions unveiled by the Welsh First Minister.

Ms Sturgeon said she "fully" supported a decision by Mark Drakeford to ban people from Covid hotspots in the rest of the UK travelling to Wales from 6pm on Friday.

In an extraordinary intervention, Mr Drakeford said he will instruct police to issue fixed penalty notices, and the Welsh people to inform on visitors.

Ms Sturgeon urged Boris Johnson to urgently chair a meeting to strike a four nations deal "on travel restrictions where necessary from high prevalence areas in one UK nation to lower prevalence in others".

But she warned that her government "will also take whatever action we consider necessary" if he failed to act. It is understood her government was considering a similar ban and urgent legal advice.

The move would currently mean a ban on travel to Scotland from the north of England, where Covid-19 cases have skyrocketed. Much of the region is in the top two tiers of the Prime Minister's new three-level lockdown system.

Manchester, Lancashire and the North East could all join Liverpool in the highest tier as soon as Thursday after ministers met on Wednesday night to discuss their fate, with Government sources also saying London could be moved into the middle tier by Friday.

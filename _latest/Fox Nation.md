INTRODUCTION

Fox News Network, LLC (“Fox” or “we” or “our”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use, and sharing of information from or about you in connection with your use of the Fox Nation Services.

The term “Fox Nation Services” or “Services” refers to our video service, including the selection of television shows, clips, and other content we may offer (collectively, the “Content”) and our video player for viewing the Content (the “Video Player”), as well as any other Fox Nation product, feature, tool, material, or other service offered from time to time by Fox through a variety of Access Points. The term “Access Points” refers to, collectively, the Fox website located here, mobile applications, streaming channels and apps, and other places where any Fox Nation Services are authorized by Fox to be made available, including websites and applications of our third party distribution partners and other websites where users or website operators are permitted to embed or have otherwise licensed the Video Player. As set forth in our Terms of Use, the Fox Nation Services are for a general audience, are not directed to children, and Fox does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age on or through the Fox Nation Services.

This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Fox Nation Services, including those who use the Fox Nation Services without registering for the Fox Nation Services and those who have registered for the Fox Nation Services. This Privacy Policy applies to Fox’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 14 below. To see a list of our affiliated companies (“Fox Affiliates”) click here. If you do not consent to the collection and use of information from or about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Fox Nation Services.

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

Fox and our service providers may collect the following information from or about you:

Registration Information is the information you submit to register for the Fox Nation Services, for example to create a Fox Nation account, receive a newsletter or mobile alert, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information, depending on the Service, may include data such as name, email address, gender, zip code, birthday, phone number, political view, and household income. In addition, Fox may collect information you provide to us when you respond to surveys, set your preferences, contact Fox through customer service or by other means, or participate in promotions that Fox may offer from time to time. Fox may allow for multiple profiles to be set up under one account. If this occurs, we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.

Usage, Log, Precise Location, and Site Activity Information. We collect information whenever you use the Fox Nation Services. Depending on the device or Access Point you are using to access our Services, this information may include your IP address, device identifiers, other unique IDs and device information, hardware characteristics, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), precise location, activity on the Fox Nation Services including information about the videos you view on Fox (e.g., show titles and episode names, start and stop times you use the Fox Nation Services, which advertising you view, clickstream data reflecting the information you enter and the selections you make while using the Fox Nation Service), page views, transactional events, referral URLs, network state, and information (including the above) stored in or transmitted using browser cookies, localStorage, pixels, “Flash” cookies, and similar technologies (see our discussion of “Cookies and Similar Technologies” below), and carrier information.

Data Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies. Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store preferences. These technologies are discussed below.

 Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and “Flash” cookies, including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data may be used. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website, app or other service can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website, app or other service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox Nation Services, such as pages you have visited, the videos and other content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. We may merge this with other data we collect about you from third parties to assist us in our ability to provide the Fox Nation Services, including the personalization of advertisements and content to you. To opt-out of interest-based advertising, visit the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.

 Third parties that support the Fox Nation Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Fox Nation Service usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox Nation Services or third party service. These third parties may also use these technologies, along with Site Activity Information they collect to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. Fox does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.

 Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows- vista/Block-or-allow-cookies). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies with the guidance available at Adobe’s website, see http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Fox Nation Services. Please note that if you use privacy controls that rely on cookies, these controls may not work properly if you choose to block or delete cookies.

 We may use or work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile software development kits (“SDKs”) to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., “ad-ID” or “IDFA”) and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Fox Nation Services. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze how you interact with Content and advertisements and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices.

The use of these various technologies in connection with advertising on the Fox Nation Services is explained further below. To learn about opting out of interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the information we have provided in Section 4 (“Your Additional Choices, Including Opt-Out Options”).

Social Media Information and Content. If you access or log-in to the Fox Nation Services through a third party social media service or another website, app, service or log-in (“Other Service”), the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that Other Service, any information or content you have permitted the Other Service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends’ lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that Other Service (collectively, “Social Media Information and Content”). When you access the Fox Nation Services through Other Services, you are authorizing Fox to collect, store, and use any and all Social Media Information and Content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Information from Other Sources. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our Fox Affiliates or business partners. Examples of this may include information (whether identified, de-identified or anonymous, and whether collected online or offline) about your interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your activities online (such as websites visited and advertisements viewed).

Authenticated Content. To access certain Content via the Fox Nation Services, you may be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page, and/or you may be required to register directly with your television content provider. Any information that you provide to your television content provider will be subject to the applicable television content provider’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, your television content provider’s use of personal information.

We may combine the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law.

In order to provide you with content and advertising (if any) that is more interesting and relevant to you, we may use the information from and about you to make inferences and predictions about your potential areas of interest. When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties to the extent permitted by applicable law.

 To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the Fox Nation Services. Fox may make your information available to certain third party service providers, such as contractors, analytics and other measurement companies, agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the Fox Nation Services, and manage and/or provide the Fox Nation Services. We may also use your information for research purposes or to compile aggregate data for internal and external business purposes.

 To deliver video content. In the ordinary course of our business, we may share information that we collect from or about you to third parties in order to process your requests and fulfill your orders for video content offered through the Fox Nation Services, including, to provide you with access to localized content and provide video content recommendations. For example, to process your request to view certain authenticated video content through the Fox Nation Services, we may need to share information about you with your designated television content provider and/or our third party service providers in order to authenticate and/or authorize you to view authenticated video content through the Fox Nation Services.

 To allow social sharing functionality. If you log in with or connect your social media account to the Fox Nation Service, we will share your social media user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other Fox Nation Services’ users and with your friends associated with your social media account.

 To provide co-branded services and features. We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with a third party (“Co-Branded Services”).

By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with the third party. The third party’s use of your information will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy.

 To deliver relevant advertisements (where applicable). We and our service providers may use the information we collect from or about you, and information that our service providers and/or Fox Affiliates collect from your use of other websites and services, through cookies and other technologies described above, to assist us in delivering you relevant ads when you visit the Fox Nation Services (on any of your devices), Fox Affiliates’ services (including any such Fox Affiliates’ websites, applications and platforms) or Other Services.

If you wish to opt out of tailored advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ or http://optout.networkadvertising.org/# on each of your devices and browsers.

Please note that opting-out does not mean that you will stop seeing all ads.

If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from Fox Nation Services, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

A link to a website that lists Fox Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy. Users who visit Fox Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. Please note that if we share your information with Fox Affiliates or if a Fox Affiliate collects any data or other information about you through platforms or services that they control, the applicable Fox Affiliate will use your information in accordance with its own independent privacy practices, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.

 To share with business partners. Fox may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications, consistent with your choices.

 To protect the rights of Fox and others. There may be instances when Fox may use or disclose your information without providing notice or choice, including situations where Fox has a good faith belief that such use or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Fox, our Fox Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our Terms of Use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the Fox Nation Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.

 Use of Aggregate or De-Identified Information. In addition to the individual data uses described in this Privacy Policy, we may aggregate information about you and/or other individuals together, or otherwise “de-identify” the information about you (which means that the information does not identify you personally).

SECURITY AND ACCOUNT ACCESS

Fox uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information.

COLLECTION OF PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY A PAYMENT SERVICE & USE OF PAYMENT INFORMATION

Fox uses an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to the Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.

We and/or Payment Service provider(s) may use payment information to help provide the Fox Nation Services. For example, payment information may be used to retrieve account information for a subscriber, to determine whether a subscriber is eligible for promotions, and to detect abuse of the Fox Nation Services. In addition, for your convenience, we or our Payment Service provider(s) may enable your payment information to be accessible through Fox Affiliate websites or services in order to process your transaction with any such Fox Affiliate. If you visit or otherwise use an Fox Affiliate website or service, refer to such Fox Affiliate’s privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

CHILDREN

Children under 13 years of age are not permitted to register with Fox. The Fox Nation Services are not intended to be used by children without involvement and approval of a parent or guardian.

THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS

The Content may be provided through third-party websites, applications and other means of access operated by other companies that do not link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, “Third-Party Platforms”). In addition, you may launch a Third-Party Platform using various devices such as mobile devices and living room devices. The Fox Nation Services may also contain links to third- party websites or applications. None of these Third-Party Platforms are operated by Fox, even if they contain our name or logo, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of their operators. Accordingly, we recommend that you review their privacy policies.

CANCELING YOUR FOX NATION SUBSCRIPTION

You may cancel your Fox Nation subscription, in accordance with our Terms of Use, or via the link accessible on the Fox Nation account page. Please note that, after you cancel your Fox Nation subscription, we may retain some information from or about you in accordance with applicable law, including for various legal, operational, accounting, and auditing purposes. In addition, your registration information will be retained for your account profile.

APPLICABLE LAW

Fox is headquartered in the United States and the Fox Nation Services are intended for users in the United States. By viewing any Content or otherwise using the Fox Nation Services, you consent to the transfer of information to the United States to the extent applicable, and the collection, storage, and processing of information under United States laws.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law or the Fox Nation Services or for other reasons. Therefore, it is important to check the effective date posted at the top of the Privacy Policy each time you visit the Fox website or use any of the Fox Nation Services to ensure you are familiar with our most updated policies and practices. If we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a notice on the Fox Nation website. If you are a registered user, we may also send an email to the email address that you most recently provided to us prior to the material change taking effect. Accordingly, please keep your account information, including email address, updated. Any material change to this Privacy Policy will be effective automatically 10 days after the revised Privacy Policy is first posted or, for users who register or otherwise provide opt-in consent during this 10-day period, at the time of registration or consent, as applicable, unless the law requires us to make the change effective sooner.

DATA RETENTION

Remember that even after you cancel your subscription, copies of some information from your subscription may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with Other Services. We may also retain backup information related to your subscription on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.

SENSITIVE INFORMATION

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Fox Nation Services or otherwise. Your use of the Service is at your own risk. Fox urges you to take steps to keep your information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging out of your account, and closing your web browser. In order to help us protect your sensitive further, you should be careful about providing your password to others.

Whenever you give Fox sensitive or confidential information, Fox will take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information by establishing a secure connection with your web browser. Fox uses an industry standard security protocol for encrypting sensitive information. Unfortunately, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed 100% secure. We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Fox and you do so at your own risk.

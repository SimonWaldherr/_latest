  Andy Burnham declares Manchester standoff was the moment regions 'rose up' 
description: > 
  The former Cabinet Minister told MPs the deadlock over coronavirus Tier 3 curbs showed the strength of devolution."And we now have a national political conversation where representatives of the North of England are heard on our national news."The need for exceptional public investment to keep out economy afloat is clear, pressing and widely accepted."There might be a debate over the exact scale of the bail-out, but we need to spend billions."The question is whether that spending will serve some larger purpose than its immediate, minimal mandate of propping up the economy."

 <p>     </p> <p>&#8220;Obviously the effect of Tier 2 restrictions is to keep people at home, reduce footfall &#8211; and that is something that we have perhaps experienced more than other places,&#8221;</p> <p>The bitter row with No10, where ministers refused to pump in the funds demanded by Mr Burnham for the region to accept being plunged into &#8220;very high&#8221; level alert category, became totemic, he believed.</p> <p>Speaking on the video link which included fellow regional mayors, he said: &#8220;Perhaps this is a moment where England rose up a little around devolution and the rest of the country,</p> <p>&#8220;The culture is still that Westminster holds all the power and all the money.</p> <p>&#8220;The mayors on this call have to go on bended knee and plead sometimes for some of that money.&#8221;</p> <p>It came as former chancellor George Osborne said the prominence of metro mayors like Greater Manchester's Andy&#160;Burnham&#160;in the ongoing debate over regional lockdowns "is a fantastic success story".</p>

 <p>Mr Osborne said mayors across the North of England and the Midlands are now part of the "national conversation", and called for further devolution as part of the post-Covid recovery.</p> <p>He told the Great Northern Conference 2020: "What I can see is real representation in the North - devolution delivering leaders of Greater Manchester, of Liverpool, of different parts of Yorkshire, of Teesside, of Tyneside, and so on, and, indeed, further south in the Midlands.</p> <p>"And we now have a national political conversation where representatives of the North of England are heard on our national news. And that is a fantastic success story."</p> <p>Mr Osborne, who is chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, introduced the idea of metro mayors as part of a series of devolution deals with English regions when he was chancellor.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>He told the online conference, which is nominally taking place in Sheffield: "I think we need to be more courageous in giving many more powers to these local elected leaders over decisions like transport, like skills, like business support, like issues like healthcare."</p> <p>He added: "I would want to see us double down on devolution because I think we're beginning to see a much more balanced, healthy British society and state where not every decision is taken at Westminster and other voices are heard.</p> <p>"But we've got much more to do."</p> <p>Opening the conference, Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis said: "Failing to realise our potential is not just a waste, it's an act of national self-harm.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>"So the case for levelling up is undeniable. It is both a deeply moral case and a deeply practical one.</p> <p>"The time to act on that case is right now.</p> <p>"It's now, first of all, because we are at one of those rare moments where politicians suddenly find the elusive money tree.</p> <p>"The need for exceptional public investment to keep out economy afloat is clear, pressing and widely accepted.</p> <p>"There might be a debate over the exact scale of the bail-out, but we need to spend billions.</p> <p>"The question is whether that spending will serve some larger purpose than its immediate, minimal mandate of propping up the economy."</p></div>

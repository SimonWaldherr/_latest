The number of deaths involving Covid-19 registered in England and Wales has risen for the fourth week in a row and is at the highest level since July 10.

A total of 321 deaths registered in the week ending October 2 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This is up from 215 deaths in the week to September 25.

Elsewhere, the test-and-trace system is only having a "marginal impact" on reducing the spread of coronavirus, key scientists advising the Government have said.

The programme will "further decline" unless it grows at the same rate as the epidemic, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned in documents released on Monday.

It has aslo emerged that Mr Johnson overruled Government scientists who pressed for national lockdown measures such as stopping all household mixing and closing all pubs.

Papers from Sage show that the body called for an immediate introduction of national interventions, saying failure to take such measures could result in "a very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences".

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Boris Johnson moved to sideline Andy Burnham today after their vicious slanging match over Greater Manchester's lockdown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PM insisted he would honour the &#163;60million package of business support for the region he offered to the Labour mayor, even though it was angrily rejected with Mr Burnham accusing the government of dooming people to 'poverty'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mr Johnson said the money would now be 'distributed to the boroughs' instead of going through the mayor's office.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The premier also jibed that he had a 'great conversation' with Sheffield City mayor Dan Jarvis, who today agreed a deal for the region to be escalated to Tier Three from Saturday.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">South Yorkshire has secured a &#163;41million deal for contact tracing, enforcement and business support, and Mr Jarvis swiped at Mr Burnham by saying he had acted 'responsibly' in reaching an agreement.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alongside a ban on households mixing indoors, pubs and bars will have to shut from midnight on Saturday, as well as betting shops,&#160;casinos and soft plays.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, gyms and leisure centres can stay open - with Liverpool also getting their rules eased after a protest at double standards between regions. West Yorkshire leaders say they have been told it will not be escalated into Tier Three this week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The latest dramatic move means 7.3million people will be under the top level of restrictions by the weekend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sum granted to South Yorks is in roughly in line with that handed to Merseyside and Lancashire, adjusting for population size.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But talks with Mr Burnham broke down yesterday after he demanded &#163;65million for Greater Manchester, which would have been proportionally far more than accepted by other areas. He originally asked for &#163;90million.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson offered &#163;60million, with government sources claiming the mayor's 'pride' stopped him saying yes.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an apparent swipe at his Labour colleague today, Mr Jarvis said: 'We all recognise the gravity of the situation and have taken the responsible route to ensure we save lives and livelihoods, and protect our NHS.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a round of interviews this morning, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick dismissed the idea that Mr Burnham learned news of the package during an explosive press conference last night. 'He didn't,' he said, adding: 'I phoned him and told him.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Jenrick also complained that the haggling with Mr Burnham had held up crucial action to protect the public. 'We probably in honesty should have acted a few days ago but we hadn't been able to reach an agreement with the mayor of Greater Manchester,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other

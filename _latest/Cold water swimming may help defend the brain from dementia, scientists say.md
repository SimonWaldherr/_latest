<p class="mol-para-with-font">Making humans hypothermic to see whether they would produce the 'cold-shock' protein presented the team with many ethical challenges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But after hearing a report on <a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54531075">BBC </a>Radio 4 Today, lido swimmer Martin Pate contacted them to say his team regularly got hypothermic - down to 34C (93F) - and would be good subjects for the study.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The swimmers were tested for the protein during the winters of 2016, 2017 and 2018, alongside members of a Tai Chi club practising by the pool - who were the controls.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The team found elevated levels of the 'cold-shock' protein in the swimmers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The research is yet to be published, but older studies have made it into top journals.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the compound wasn't found in higher quantities in the martial art club members who never entered the pool.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Giovanna Mallucci, who led the research, told the BBC the findings proved humans, just like hibernating animals, can produce the protein.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But she warned cold water immersion is certainly not a possible dementia treatment because the risks of plummeting temperatures could far outweigh the benefits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hypothermia can cause vital organs to shut down and an irregular heartbeat, putting sufferers at risk of death.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said the mission is to find a drug that can trigger the production of this protein, which could protect the brain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you slowed the progress of dementia by even a couple of years on a whole population, that would have an enormous impact economically and health-wise,' Professor Mallucci said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than a million people in the UK suffer from dementia, while in the US approximately 5.7million people also have the debilitating condition.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 'cold-shock' protein was identified in 2015, when ordinary mice and mice suffering from dementia or prion disease - where proteins in the brain cause irreversible damage to the organ - were cooled&#160;to 16-18C (60F-64F) for 45 minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The scientists found that RBM3 levels rose in ordinary mice and allowed them to regrow synapses, suggesting a pivotal role for the protein.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In mice with Alzheimer's and prion disease, however, they were not able to regrow the brain links.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But results showed that prion-ridden mice that were cooled did not succumb to the disease as quickly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The scientists said their work, published in the journal Nature, suggested the protein could be used to slow the onset of dementia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But further trials are essential to proving the findings would work on humans.</p><img id="i-c0fc6056873f2bec" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="425" width="634" alt="The 'cold-shock' protein could help keep the symptoms for dementia at bay for longer (stock)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-c0fc6056873f2bec" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/10/34565308-8854437-image-m-2_1603101323686.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="The 'cold-shock' protein could help keep the symptoms for dementia at bay for longer (stock)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">The 'cold-shock' protein could help keep the symptoms for dementia at bay for longer (stock)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dementia is a debilitating condition where the sufferer loses memory, struggles to keep up with conversations and can become confused about where they are.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The disease is a term used to describe a decline in brain function, which are normally triggered by a build-up of proteins in the brain causing nerve cells to function less well and eventually die.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This also leads to the break-down of synapses, reducing communication in the brain leading to memory loss, problems with day-to-day activities and other symptoms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The synapses are used for transferring electric signals between cells, allowing us to think and move normally.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The NHS warns that dementia sufferers tend to get worse over time, although medication may be able to slow the progression of the disease.</p></div>

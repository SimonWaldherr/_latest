In its most widespread reshuffling to date of this season's schedule, the NFL announced on Sunday changes to eight teams' slates in light of multiple recent positive tests for COVID-19.

The most immediate move was the postponement of the New England Patriots' game against the Denver Broncos, previously scheduled for Monday, to next Sunday. On Sunday, the Patriots shut down their facility after an additional player test positive for COVID-19, according to multiple reports. Quarterback Cam Newton missed the team's game against the Kansas City Chiefs last Monday after testing positive, and cornerback Stephon Gilmore tested positive afterward.

The Buffalo Bills' game against the Kansas City Chiefs, scheduled for Thursday, was pushed to next Monday. The NFL announced last week the game would be delayed in light of the Bills' game against the Tennessee Titans being delayed until Tuesday.

The Bills-Titans game remains set on the schedule after the Titans again closed their facility Sunday in response to another staff member testing positive for COVID-19. Since Sept. 24, 13 players and 11 staff members for the organization have tested positive.

The Los Angeles Chargers, Miami Dolphins, Jacksonville Jaguars and New York Jets all had their bye weeks moved and at least one contest rescheduled to allow for the other moves.

(CNN) Although live theaters have closed during the pandemic, they have also found ways to still entertain -- perhaps none more creatively than the Geffen Playhouse, rebranded a "Stayhouse" in interactive virtual shows designed to bridge the gap among us not just for patrons in its native Los Angeles but anyone with an Internet connection.

"The Present," a brilliant magic act from Helder Guimarães adapted to a virtual format, is ending its extended run, which began in May, later this month. Guimarães performs card tricks, augmenting that with an affectionate look back at his youth, when an accident forced him to stay home for a stretch, reflective of the experiences people are currently enduring.

Having performed for small groups -- each of which received a box in the mail containing items put to use during the show -- Guimarães' production will conclude with a "grand finale" on Oct. 17 that has already registered thousands of viewers.

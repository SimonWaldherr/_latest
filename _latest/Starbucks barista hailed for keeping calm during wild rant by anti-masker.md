<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A Starbucks barista is going viral for keeping her cool when a California customer went on a wild rant after being asked to wear her mask &#8212; even randomly screaming &#8220;F&#8211;k Black Lives Matter&#8221; at the black teen.</p>
<p>Alex Beckom, 19, said she <a href="https://www.facebook.com/awesomepie101/videos/3153114534816207" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked the customer to wear a face covering</a> in the java joint in suburban San Diego on Sunday when the woman in a cropped blue top and black shorts started ranting about staff &#8220;discriminating against&#8221; her.</p>
<p>&#8220;F&#8211;k Black Lives Matter. I need a straw,&#8221; the enraged customer barks at the teen barista. Beckom then politely hands her utensils and some sugar.</p>
<p>In an apologetic tone, Beckom then tells the customer, who had a mask around her chin but not covering her face, that &#8220;the next time you come in, I need you to put your mask on&#8221; &#8212; further enraging the anti-masker.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not a law &#8212; it&#8217;s not a law! And I can show you the penal code and everything. It&#8217;s a hoax!&#8221; the customer yells as she starts walking away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to wear a mask &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to wear a mask! This is America and I don&#8217;t have to do what you say!&#8221; the customer screams.</p>
<p>With a loud &#8220;F&#8211;k you,&#8221; the angry anti-masker finally leaves &#8212; just to come straight back in for one last shot, again yelling, &#8220;F&#8211;k Black Lives Matter!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another customer immediately sympathizes with Beckom &#8212; who was quickly hailed on social media for keeping her cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mad props to the barista tho. I woulda knocked the lady flat out,&#8221; one woman named Gabby <a href="https://twitter.com/spoiledbeakie/status/1317966290196353025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on Twitter, while another, named Sara, <a href="https://twitter.com/saraakm7/status/1318050736765235200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>, &#8220;Damn @Starbucks give this woman a raise!!!&#8221;</p>
 
<p>The video also pleased the most important person, Beckom <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thatotheralex/video/6885407406638009606?source=h5_m" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a later update</a> &#8212; her manager, who was &#8220;happy that I managed the situation with poise and maturity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t I just punch the lady? Because I like my job, and I want to keep my job,&#8221; Beckom said with a smile.</p>
<p>Starbucks <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/santee-barista-brushes-off-racist-anti-mask-tirade-from-customer-who-to-cover-up/2427377/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NBC San Diego</a> that the customer&#8217;s behavior &#8220;is not welcome in our stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus right now is providing support to our partner who demonstrated tremendous composure during a very difficult interaction,&#8221; the coffee giant said.</p>

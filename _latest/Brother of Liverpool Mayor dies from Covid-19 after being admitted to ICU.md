The Mayor of Liverpool has said his brother has died in hospital after being admitted to intensive care with Covid-19.

Joe Anderson said on Twitter that, despite the best efforts of staff at the Royal Liverpool Hospital's intensive care unit, his eldest brother died on Friday night.

Thanking "dedicated" hospital workers and the public for messages of support, he called for people to "stick together" amid a surge of coronavirus cases in Merseyside.

The Liverpool City Region became the first area to face the toughest local lockdown restrictions in England this week, after being placed on a very high alert level in the three-tier system.

The mayor tweeted on Saturday morning: "Despite the efforts of all the staff @LivHospitals ICU my brother sadly died at 10.45 last night.

"We want to thank the dedicated staff risking their lives for us. Thank you all for your messages of love and support. Let's stick together and support each other and win this battle."

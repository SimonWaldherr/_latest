The adidas Harden Vol. 5 is releasing soon as adidas and the Houston Rockets guard continue to reach new heights and redefine the game.

It wasnâ€™t that long ago that we got a first look at the pair. Now, more images surface as the adidas Harden Vol. 5 is rumored to release in a predominately red colorway with multi-colored details. While the specifics of the shoe are unknown, Boost and a low-top cut take center stage as the latest signature model looks to keep Harden light and quick on his feet.

Take a look at the unofficial images of the pair below as we await official release information from The Beard and the Three Stripes. Meanwhile, take a look at our release date calendar and be sure to subscribe to stay on top of every sneaker release.

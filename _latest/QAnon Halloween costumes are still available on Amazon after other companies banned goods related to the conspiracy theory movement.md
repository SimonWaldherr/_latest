<p>Several QAnon-themed Halloween costumes for kids are still available on Amazon from third-party sellers despite other tech companies banning the conspiracy theory in recent weeks.</p><p>QAnon is a baseless far-right conspiracy theory that claims President Donald Trump is fighting a deep-state cabal of human traffickers. The movement has been linked to several criminal allegations, including murders and attempted kidnappings, and the FBI has classified it as a potential domestic terrorism threat.&#160;</p><p>And yet these costumes, most of which are wizards' cloaks, are marketed towards children &#8212; or, much more likely, their parents.&#160;</p><p>A search for "QAnon costumes kids" yields 178 results, with most of the items being QAnon masks or non-QAnon-related costumes. Insider found at least 10 costumes for kids related to QAnon on Amazon as of Tuesday afternoon.&#160;</p>

<p>One of the QAnon costumes, which were <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/amazon-selling-qanon-themed-halloween-costumes-for-kids/">first reported by The New York Post</a>, is a black cloak with an image of Trump's face surrounded by a "Q" designed with the American flag, a symbol that is often used as a logo among QAnon conspiracy theorists. The cloak also features the acronym "WWG1WGA," which means, "Where we go one, we go all."</p><p>

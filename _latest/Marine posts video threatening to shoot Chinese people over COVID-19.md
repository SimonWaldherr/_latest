A foul-mouthed Marine fresh out of boot camp is under investigation for a racist rant threatening to target Chinese people upon his deployment — claiming “China is going to pay” for its handling of the coronavirus, officials said.

The disturbing 32-second clip, posted Thursday to Twitter by an Army noncommissioned officer, shows Pfc. Jarrett Morford, 20, using racial slurs against Chinese citizens while referencing the caliber of bullet used in standard rifles issued to Marines, Stars and Stripes reported.

“As the honorable Trump said on Twitter today, it was China’s fault,” Morford said in the footage while in uniform. “China is going to pay for what they’ve done to this country and the world. I don’t give a f–k!”

Morford, of Windsor, Colorado, graduated from boot camp in August and is currently training for a communications job in Twentynine Palms, California, Stars and Stripes reported.

A Marine Corps spokesman told the outlet an investigation into Morford’s rant is underway and vowed that “appropriate action” by his command would be taken.

“There is no place for racism in the Marine Corps,” Capt. Joseph Butterfield told Stars and Stripes. “Those who can’t value the contributions of others, regardless of background, are destructive to our culture and do not represent our core values.”

It’s unclear exactly which tweet Morford was referencing, but President Trump has repeatedly characterized COVID-19 as the “China virus,” including as recently as Thursday while vowing to keep pressing tariffs against the nation.

Morford did not return a request for comment regarding the footage, Military.com reported Thursday.

The post showing Morford’s rant had been retweeted more than 4,300 times as of Friday.

“Anyone recognize this racist?” the tweet read. “It’s hard to tell where he’s at, and sadly no name tapes.”

She often captures attention of her 116m Instagram followers.

And Miley Cyrus offered up a show stopping display in a post on Monday, as she donned a bright structured gown.

The 27-year-old singer licked an apple while lounging on a luxe couch in the unique ensemble for a quirky yet regal display.

The former Disney star posed like a statue in the yellow and pink dress with large puffed ruffle layers at her midriff and two at the bottom of her legs.

With her arms out and legs together, Miley looked off in the distance with her blonde hair down in her latest signature mullet style.

The dress was in a shiny and metallic material, and featured a mermaid cut between the puffed ruffle layers.

She added pink gloves and layered diamond accessories with cuff bracelets, large diamond hoop earrings, and rings.

Lyrics: 'I want to be the girl with the most cake,' she wrote in the caption from Courtney Love's band Holes' song Doll Parts. 'I love him so much it just turns to hate. I fake it so real, I am beyond fake'

In a second snap she leaned forward highlighting her cleavage as she blew a kiss towards the camera with her bright red pout.

She then posed with her backside towards the camera, and looking over her shoulder as she extended her arms out in a display frame.

'I want to be the girl with the most cake,' she wrote in the caption from Courtney Love's band Holes' song Doll Parts. 'I love him so much it just turns to hate. I fake it so real, I am beyond fake.'

Miley originally posted portrait-style photos from the shoot in the same outfit, earlier in the day Monday as she celebrated the success of her latest single Midnight Sky.

Thank you: 'Midnight Sky is on her 6th week #1 at UK radio,' she wrote. 'Broke the record for most weeks at the top in 2020.' Adding: 'Thank YOU so much for all the love you show me and my art! It’s my honor makin music for you'

In the portrait she closed her eyes and opened her mouth wide, sticking out her tongue.

She went on to lay on a luxurious pink couch, with a sea shell-shaped end, as she licked an apple with her eyes closed.

Sober: She revealed to Variety earlier this summer that she had gone completely sober after having major vocal surgery in November

Getting cheeky, she then tried to pull off her pink glove using only her teeth.

The retro-inspired shoot continued with more business chic outfits, as she shat in a colorful structured chair in a sheer purple set of a button-up blouse and pants.

Miley also posed in a silver metallic desk chair in a black 'power suit' as she again stuck her tongue out, which she used to encourage fans to vote.

The lockdown gave Miley the chance to reflect on her life and to write new material based on her recent experiences.

Cyrus — who divorced Liam Hemsworth earlier this year — told The Graham Norton Show: 'It gave me time to write and reflect – normally I write about what is happening, but I started writing about what had happened – it was a very reflective period.'

She previously likened her split from Liam to a 'death' and admitted she was still coming to terms with their split after getting married in 2018.

'I had a very public, very big break-up that was over a ten-year span of a relationship,' she said.

'It’s like a death when you lose a love that deep. It feels like a death. Honestly, sometimes [death] even feels easier because [with a break-up] the person is still walking on the Earth.'

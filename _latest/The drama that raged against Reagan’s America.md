<div><p>In July 1981, 26 cases of Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma, an exceedingly rare cancer, were identified exclusively in gay men by doctors in New York and California. This came some weeks after a report was published by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention describing how five previously healthy gay men had been diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia. These were opportunistic infections resultant of Aids, a chronic condition caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which effectively destroys the immune system. HIV had been spreading, undetected, through America&#8217;s gay population since around the early 1970s, a result of sexual transmission among a demographic whose promiscuity was not only a convention of queer sociability but a revolutionary political act in the wake of the 1969 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190625-stonewall-riots-the-beacon-for-people-around-the-world">Stonewall rebellion</a>.</p>
<p>Ninety-five and a half per cent of those diagnosed with AIDS between 1981 and 1987 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a2.htm#tab1">died</a>. As Dr Paul Volberding, a San Francisco medic who helped to set up America&#8217;s first hospital inpatient ward for Aids sufferers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/nancy-ronald-reagan-aids-crisis-first-lady-legacy">recalled to The Guardian in 2016</a>: &#8220;This is the most fatal infectious disease ever seen. Without treatment, 98% die. More than Ebola. More than Smallpox.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until <a href="https://npin.cdc.gov/pages/hiv-and-aids-timeline">24 September, 1982</a> that the CDC would use the acronym Aids; medical practitioners had up to that point designated the novel virus Grid (Gay Related Immune Deficiency), or more colloquially &#8216;gay cancer&#8217;, or &#8216;gay plague&#8217; &#173;&#8211; the implication being that this was an exclusively gay disease. Conventional logic should tell us that viruses do not discriminate, but in a US lurching towards social conservatism under the Reagan administration, this was perfect ammunition for right-wing pressure groups such as Jerry Falwell&#8217;s Reagan-allied Moral Majority. Falwell proclaimed Aids to be the &#8220;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1622155489">the wrath of God</a>,&#8221; a view that spread into public opinion; comparing the crisis to the Holocaust in 1988, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/books/l-aids-and-the-holocaust-156488.html">the playwright William H Hoffman wrote</a>: &#8220;as with the present situation, the general population by and large viewed the victims with a mixture of fear, hatred and indifference.&#8221;</p></div>

<div><p id="speakable-summary">Last night, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/aoc-aims-to-get-out-the-vote-by-streaming-among-us-with-pokimane-and-hasanabi/">live on Twitch to stream Among Us</a> with a handful of superstar streamers. The purpose of the stream, which drew a massive crowd, was to get out the vote as we head into the general election.</p>
<p>At its peak, the stream drew a concurrent viewership of 435,000+ people, and that&#8217;s just on AOC&#8217;s Twitch. Other streamers that were in the game, such as Pokimane, HasanAbi and DrLupo, also had their own viewerships tuned in to the game.</p>
<p>For context, this puts AOC&#8217;s stream in the top five of most concurrent viewers on a Twitch stream. The record is still held by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/14/drake-and-ninja-are-playing-fortnight-live-on-twitch/">Ninja&#8217;s Fortnite stream with Drake</a> which hit more than 600,000 concurrent viewers.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>Among Us has been around for several years, but only enjoyed top-tier popularity over the past few months as streamers flock to the game. Among Us is a relatively simple game, but gives players the chance to truly show off their personality.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<p>Between four and ten players join a drop ship. The majority of those players are crewmates who have tasks to complete on the map &#8212; these tasks are simple, puzzle-based mini games. The remaining minority of players are impostors, who sabotage and kill crewmates. When a dead body is found and reported, the whole group gets into voice chat to discuss who might be the killer. It&#8217;s a bit like a murder mystery party combined with a video game.</p>
<p>There is some irony in the fact that politicians (Rep. Ilhan Omar joined AOC) jumped into a game where lying is a primary skill. In fact, AOC mentioned before gameplay ever started that she was very nervous because she&#8217;s terrible at lying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that this isn&#8217;t the first time that AOC has come to younger voters where they are. The congresswoman played Animal Crossing in May and visited players&#8217; islands.</p>

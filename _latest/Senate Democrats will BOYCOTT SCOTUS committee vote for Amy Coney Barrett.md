Nevertheless, it will allow Senate Democrats to show fire as voters are going to the polls, amid signs of frustration among base voters who were hoping to see the nomination stalled until after the election.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes after the top Democrat on the committee, Sen.

'Barrett deserves to be on the Supreme Court and she will be confirmed.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Committee rules say at least two members of the minority party, Democrats, would need to be present to constitute a quorum for doing business. Graham made no mention of the process ahead, if Democrats fail to show up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mike Davis, a former top aide on the panel who now advises Senate Republicans, said the committee was well within its normal practice to hold the vote, even if Democrats skip it. He said the longstanding practice has been to allow business to go forward if all members of the majority, Republicans, attend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two Republican senators on the panel, Mike Lee and Thom Tillis, tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the Rose Garden event where Trump announced Barrett as his nominee. The panel established remote operations during the coronavirus pandemic. Those two senators have since returned to in-person sessions, saying their doctors cleared them from quarantine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two other Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, have objected to the quick vote, but they are not on the panel. Even if they oppose Barrett's confirmation, Republicans have the votes to push ahead. No Senate Democrats are expected to support Barrett's confirmation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barrett, a 48-year-old appellate court judge who has spoken out against abortion and a court ruling on the Affordable Care Act, is on track to lock in a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court for years to come.</p></div>

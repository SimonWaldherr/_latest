Business Insider is proud to announce that Blake Chandlee will speak at the inaugural BI Global Trends Festival, a virtual event taking place the week of October 19-23, 2020.

Chandlee is the VP overseeing all of TikTok's ad partnerships, sales operations, and anything the app does to generate revenue â€” making him one of the most important people running the company's US operations today.

The company has been in the spotlight since the Trump administration's attempts to issue a nationwide ban on the app, which allows users to record short videos synchronized with music. Now, the decision on the ban will be delayed until at least after Election Day 2020.

Chandlee came in at the beginning of 2020 to head up TikTok's global business solutions, the division working with brands to advertise on the growing platform, Business Insider previously reported. Under Chandlee, TikTok's ad product offerings have expanded dramatically, to include opportunities for sponsored hashtags and challenges, in-feed videos, and branded AR effects.

TikTok has nearly 800 million users. Chandlee revealed a few months ago that the company wants to launch a purchasing tool similar to Instagram's, allowing users to buy directly from the app.

Chandlee previously worked at Facebook for more than 12 years overseeing global partnerships.

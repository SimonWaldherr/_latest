<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">What should Joe Biden&#8217;s economic policy be if he wins (and Democrats take the Senate, so that he can actually pass legislation)? I&#8217;m pretty sure I know what his economists think he should do, but I&#8217;m not equally sure that everyone on his political team fully gets it, and I&#8217;m worried that the news media will experience sticker shock &#8212; that is, they may not be ready for the price tag on what he should and probably will propose.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">So here&#8217;s what everyone should understand: Given the current and likely future state of the U.S. economy, it&#8217;s time to (a) spend a lot of money on the future and (b) not worry about where the money is coming from. For now, and for at least the next few years, large-scale deficit spending isn&#8217;t just OK, it&#8217;s the only responsible thing to do.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Today&#8217;s column will be about the economics; I&#8217;ll talk about the politics another day.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">First things first: If Biden is inaugurated in January, he will inherit a nation still devastated by the coronavirus. Trump keeps saying that we&#8217;re &#8220;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-virus-outbreak-ap-fact-check-donald-trump-technology-a6ddb8360fa9b1ff95acbbc1e03f437e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rounding the corner</a>,&#8221; but the reality is that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-all-key-metrics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cases and hospitalizations</a> are surging (and anyone expecting a lame-duck Trump administration to take effective action against the surge is living in a dream world.) And we won&#8217;t be able to have a full economic recovery as long as the pandemic is still raging.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">What this means is that it will be crucial to provide another round of large-scale fiscal relief, especially aid to the unemployed and to cash-strapped state and local governments. The main purpose of this relief will be humanitarian &#8212; helping families pay the rent and keep food on the table, helping cities and towns avoid devastating cuts in essential services. But it will also help avoid a downward economic spiral, by heading off a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/econjared/status/1317903888125775879" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potential collapse</a> in consumer and local government spending.</p></div>

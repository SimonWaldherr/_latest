  Heroes run to the fire.Only this fire is invisible, tearing through communities across the United States, overwhelming even the best-equipped hospitals and health systems.In recognition of these individuals – and the herculean efforts being mounted by hospitals, health systems and other institutions around the country – we are unveiling a special ongoing series: U.S. News Hospital Heroes.The project will unfold with a series of profiles published on usnews.com.At least 9,200 health care workers have tested positive for the virus – which officials acknowledge is likely an undercount of the true magnitude.

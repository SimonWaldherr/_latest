Less than a month from Election Day, both companies finally became arbiters of the truth on the internet.

They should also have a public corrections policy and practice non-partisanship,&#8221;&#160;Tard&#225;guila&#160;wrote. &#8220;when Facebook publicly acknowledged that it also reduces the distribution of potential disinformation using other methods, the company surprised not only its users, but also the IFCN community.&#8221;&#160;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-facebook-honcho-says-big-tech-exacerbates-the-societal-division-calls-for-social-media-reform-to-save-de" target="_blank">EX-FACEBOOK HONCHO TIM KENDALL SAYS BIG TECH IS A &#8216;THREAT TO DEMOCRACY,&#8217; CALLS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA REFORM</a></strong>&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>She then asked, &#8220;What methodology do Facebook employees use in those situations?

The fact-checking community, however, wasn&#8217;t aware of it... which is a bit strange, considering they work together to tackle misinformation.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/social-dilemma-filmmaker-election-twitter-facebook-netflix" target="_blank">'THE SOCIAL DILEMMA' FILMMAKER SAYS &#8216;ANY COUNTRY&#8217; COULD MEDDLE IN ELECTION WITH WEAPON OF MASS MISINFORMATION</a></strong>&#160;</p><p>She then noted that Twitter&#8217;s initial claim that it doesn&#8217;t allow hacked content to spread didn&#8217;t add up, either.&#160;&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Some fact-checkers laughed at this assertion recalling previous episodes involving Wikileaks and the National Security Agency,&#8221;&#160;Tard&#225;guila&#160;wrote.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;Transparency is essential to the fact-checking community and to the cause of reducing mis and disinformation,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The decision to reduce or prevent the distribution of the New York Post&#8217;s article based on some mysterious, non-transparent criteria and an unknown methodology is a serious mistake. It is a step that brings these companies closer to the slippery slope of censorship.&#8221;&#160;</p><p><strong><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank">CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Fox News' Marisa Schultz contributed to this report&#160;</p><p class="ad gam"></p></div>

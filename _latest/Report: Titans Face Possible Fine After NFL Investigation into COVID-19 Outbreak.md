That apparently mattered.

"They're taking intent and motive into account.

As La Canfora shared, one general manager was not pleased:</p><p class="">"All of a sudden the Titans win a game on national television and now it's like all is forgiven? If that's what they do, it's total (BS). They weren't following the rules. They had an outbreak that kept growing and it forced how many other teams to move around and adjust? We weren't even affected by it and I'm pissed off. I couldn't believe what I heard Tuesday night and neither could my owner."</p><p class="">Tennessee's Week 4 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers was moved to Week 7, while its Week 5 game against the Bills was moved to a Tuesday. That caused a chain reaction for the Bills' and Steelers' schedules, with Pittsburgh being forced into an early Week 4 bye as well.</p><p id="br-ad-112172273" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Despite the outbreak, the Titans are 5-0 and sit atop the AFC South. They face the undefeated Steelers at Nissan Stadium in a key AFC showdown Sunday.</p></div>

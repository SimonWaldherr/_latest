Leading infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Friday that the White House hosted a "superspreader event" last month.

Fauci appeared to be referring to the Rose Garden ceremony to announce the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump and several others tested positive for the coronavirus following the event.

"I think the data speak for themselves," Fauci told CBS News Radio. "We had a superspreader event in the White House, and it was in a situation where people were crowded together and were not wearing masks."

Trump has suggested he got the virus from meeting with the Gold Star Families, saying they "come within an inch of my face." He told Fox Business, "I'm not telling them to back up. I'm not doing it."

Trump's infection led him to be admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He returned to the White House on Monday, and his doctor indicated he would likely be able to restart public engagements on Saturday.

description: > 
  Donald Trump will end his presidency just as he began it, longtime conservative commentator George Will predicted in his new column for The Washington Post.And that is by whining.Trump is “a practitioner of crybaby conservatism,” Will noted in the op-ed published Wednesday.“His presidency that began with a wallow in self-pity probably will end in ignominy when he slinks away pouting, trailing clouds of recriminations, without a trace of John McCain’s graciousness on election night 2008,” he added.Will later used the column to call out the GOP, which he left in mid-2016 as Trump became its next presidential candidate.

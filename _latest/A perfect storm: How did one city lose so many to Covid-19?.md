The red sirens wail as the ambulance darts across Manaus’s south zone, dodging vehicles and skipping traffic lights. Inside Dr Said and her colleagues, clad head to toe in bright blue PPE, fight to keep a patient’s condition constant.

The 58-year-old man is struggling to breathe – his symptoms have been worsening for a week. After he walked into a basic health clinic doctors quickly concluded that he needed intensive care.

But when the ambulance reaches one of Manaus’s largest hospitals, 28 DeAgosto, doctors there have already run out of the oxygen the man desperately needs.

“It feels like we’ve been through this agony before,” says Dr Said. “Now I’m preparing my spirits to do it all again – and again and again and again...”

At the graveyard, too, the work hasn’t stopped. Harsh scrapes of shovels against the ochre earth reverberate as two men in bright green protective suits unceremoniously bury yet another coronavirus victim.

Iris Goncalves Alves, aged just 54, is the 1,950th Covid casualty in this sloping site at Parque Tarumã cemetery. Fallen trees on its perimeter are a reminder that until the pandemic hit, this plot was covered in thick foliage, rather than hundreds and hundreds of graves.

While most victims are memorialised with a simple blue cross – which bunch together where the mechanical diggers excavated long trenches for mass burials – some graves are marked only by a mound of dirt. The crosses cost 80 Brazilian reals, roughly £10, and many families couldn’t afford them.

Ms Alves’ relatives, however, have spared no expense. Her burial, for this is barely a funeral, is sparse; there are no comforting words from a priest, no eulogy from her children. But her engraved wooden coffin is polished, with a small perspex window so her family can see her face one final time before she disappears into the ground.

The site becomes eerily quiet as the gravediggers finish and lay down their shovels, chucking their surgical gloves to one side. The still is punctured only by birdsong and the occasional sob as the family say their final, low-key goodbyes.

Mr Ulisses prays for the relative calm to remain. “In April the noise was nonstop, the work was nonstop,” he says, sweat dripping down his brow in the heat. “We can only ask God to spare us now.”

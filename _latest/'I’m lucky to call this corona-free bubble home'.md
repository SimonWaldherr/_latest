The waves sparkle in the golden-hour sun. Lady Buddha stands tall, watching over Da Nang from the mountainous peninsula. In this moment, as I take in the serenity of the near-empty beach, I couldn’t be more relieved that I ignored the advice from the British Embassy to leave Vietnam and get home to safety earlier this year.

This central Vietnamese city is known for captivating anyone who visits, and I am no exception. My plans for a brief visit back to my ‘happy place’ before continuing my travels were quickly derailed by the virus. Now, I’m lucky to call this corona-free bubble home.

With no locally transmitted infections in more than a month, Vietnam is now one of the safest places in the world. The country’s response to the pandemic was nothing short of astounding; its serious, fast-acting and no-nonsense approach has kept its people as safe as possible. Thirty-five Covid-related deaths and a total of 1,099 cases in a country of 97 million is almost unbelievable.

Back in March, my fortune-telling skills weren’t up to scratch, so as cases in Vietnam continued to rise so too did my fear of being stuck in a foreign country with a healthcare system that might not have been able to cope with a large-scale outbreak. I didn’t need to worry. Borders were closed, hundreds of thousands of people were quarantined, strict rules were followed, and the virus was effectively eliminated.

In hindsight, the 99 virus-free days that followed were perhaps too good to be true. While friends and family back home struggled with isolation, I was celebrating Vietnam’s frankly underreported success with thousands of others at various non-socially distanced events. Feeling grateful for my situation, but guilty that most of the world wasn’t able to experience the same level of freedom, was a constant emotional rollercoaster.

In July, the course of the rollercoaster changed. A mysterious Covid-19 breakout in Da Nang Hospital put the city back on high alert. Was this about to put an end to the freedom for good? Da Nang became the epicentre of Vietnam’s second wave and was quickly locked down. Domestic tourists were evacuated, all non-essential businesses were forced to close, whole streets were quarantined and officials patrolled them, fining anyone seen to be breaking the rules.

This time felt different. We’d all seen what the chaos of an uncontrolled outbreak could do in other countries around the world. The streets that were once filled with motorbikes, relentlessly honking their horns, were deathly quiet. The once-bustling local market was a shell of its former self after access was restricted.

• The countries you can feasibly visit right now

At times, the ‘indefinite’ lockdown felt never-ending, but the overwhelming feeling among locals was still one of hope. Hope that Da Nang would surely win the fight against the virus for a second time. Sure enough, the battle was won. As the number of confirmed cases fell and mandatory tests for the 2,000 or so foreigners remaining in the city came back negative, lockdown restrictions began to ease. Normal life once again quickly resumed.

The conversations between ex-pats, digital nomads and English teachers who stayed to ride out the waves of the virus often revolve around feelings of immense luck and gratitude. But while we take advantage of the more-than-desirable balance of the low cost of living and high quality of life, local people continue to struggle with the economic impact of closed borders and a lack of tourism.

“Tourism is one of the biggest industries in Da Nang. All local people here depend on tourism to survive,” local business owner Lê Thị Mai Hương told me. Her cafe is located in An Thuong, the tourist hub of Da Nang. With prices too high to suit the average Vietnamese coffee-drinker, she has to rely on the dwindling ex-pat community for business.

“We are so lucky that Vietnam dealt with the virus so quickly. With no financial support from the government, things would be a lot worse if I had been forced to close for a longer period of time.”

Without an influx of backpackers and travellers, all businesses in the once-thriving tourist area are struggling, with many having no choice but to close. “The only hope for my hostel is a vaccine,” said owner Đoán Nguyễn. “Hostels are dead. Who’s to say people will want to stay in dorm rooms even after the pandemic is over?”

What has struck me most about living in Vietnam during the pandemic is the palpable importance of community. The people of Vietnam’s intrinsic collectivist nature is a far cry from the individualistic traits of many in the West. Here, wearing a mask and following government guidelines in order to protect others, regardless of the personal cost, is actively encouraged by all.

“I didn’t realise how strong Da Nang’s community spirit was until I visited the UK,” says Nguyễn. "Everyone here helps each other. [...] I’m not worried about the Vietnamese people. We will survive and get through this together."

Charitable endeavours have been set up across the city by ex-pats and locals alike to support Da Nang’s most vulnerable. Community is at the heart of Vietnam’s pandemic success and there is a sense of awareness among us all that we are experiencing something truly unique.

It’s uncertain when Vietnam will open its borders to tourists again, but it certainly doesn’t look like it will be any time soon, especially not without strict quarantine measures. I have every hope that the local people responsible for keeping me so safe can thrive again and that tourists can soon safely experience the true magic of Da Nang.

Eddie Van Halen, who has died of throat cancer aged 65, was the co-founder of the American rock band which bore his name and was widely acclaimed as one of the most accomplished and influential guitarists in popular music.

Van Halen were probably best known in the UK for their hit single Jump, which reached No 7 in 1984 and was their only pop No 1 in the US. In retrospect, the track seems to encapsulate the exuberance and excess of the decade.

Its success, in America at least, paved the way for rather more fey British bands to be brushed aside by legions of MTV-friendly poodle-haired rockers.

Yet, based as it was around a synthesiser riff, the song was atypical of much of the group’s output. It did, however, showcase Eddie Van Halen’s squealing, pealing guitar sound.

<p>The world hit a new benchmark in the COVID-19 pandemic on Monday, surpassing 40 million coronavirus infections, according to data compiled by <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">Johns Hopkins University</a>. With the flu season looming, the rate of new cases in the U.S. and other countries is rising at rates not seen in months.</p>   <p>The disease has killed more than 1.1 million people, including nearly 220,000 in the U.S., which remains the world's worst-hit country despite having less than 5% of the global population.</p>   <p>A worrying rise in new cases has triggered new shutdowns across Europe, where France, Belgium and the Czech Republic are among the countries seeing a surge in cases. Many of the measures announced this month are local or partial closures, as officials try to avoid the national lockdowns that have wreaked economic havoc in 2020.</p>   <p>India has seen its rate of new cases fall in recent weeks, after a meteoric rise in August and September. More than 114,000 people there have died from COVID-19. </p>   <p>The U.S. once again has the <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases">highest new case rate</a> in the world. The seven-day daily average in the U.S. is nearing the 60,000 mark &#8212; the level the country maintained for weeks this past summer during an alarming surge.</p>

   <p>"New cases have gone up by nearly 30% from two weeks ago" in the U.S., as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/19/924972322/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-highest-level-since-late-july">NPR's Will Stone reports</a>.</p>   <p>The 10 countries with the most infections as of Monday morning are:</p>   <ol class="edTag">   <li>United States: 8,156,970 cases</li>   <li>India: 7,550,273</li>   <li>Brazil: 5,235,344</li>   <li>Russia: 1,406,504</li>   <li>Argentina: 989,680</li>   <li>Colombia: 959,572</li>   <li>France: 938,606</li>   <li>Spain: 936,560</li>   <li>Peru: 868,675</li>   <li>Mexico: 851,227</li>   </ol>   <p>By February of next year, the global death toll could rise to 2.4 million people, according to a widely cited <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/global?view=total-deaths&amp;tab=trend">fatality projection</a> by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, or IHME, a research center at the University of Washington. The institute warns that an additional 1 million people could die if health mandates are eased. </p>   <p>Health experts are urging people to wear face masks and to get vaccinated against the seasonal flu, hoping to minimize an illness that<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html#:~:text=While%20the%20impact%20of%20flu,61%2C000%20deaths%20annually%20since%202010"> normally kills</a> between 12,000 and 61,000 people in the U.S. each year.

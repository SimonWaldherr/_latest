President Trump spoke Saturday to a raucous crowd of supporters at the White House, his first public address since being hospitalized with COVID-19.

“Keep that energy going!” Trump said for a White House balcony, as the crowd chanted “Four more years!”

“We have to vote these people into oblivion,” he added.

The event, dubbed a “peaceful protest for law and order,” drew hundreds of blue-clad members of Blexit, a campaign spearheaded by Candace Owens that urges Black Americans to leave the Democratic Party.

“Sleepy Joe Biden has betrayed black and Latino Americans for half a century,” Trump told the group. “Black and Latino Americans are rejecting the radical socialist left.”

But it was not tied to Trump’s re-election effort, the White House said.

“This is an official event,” deputy press secretary Judd Deere said. “The campaign is not involved in this.”

Trump will make his official return to the campaign trail on Monday, with a rally in Sanford, Fla.

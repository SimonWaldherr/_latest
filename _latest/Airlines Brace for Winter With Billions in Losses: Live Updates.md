American lost $2.4 billion over the quarter, while Southwest lost more than $1.1 billion and Alaska lost more than $430 million.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Air travel has improved somewhat steadily since early summer and reached a symbolic milestone on Sunday, when more than 1 million people were screened at federal airport checkpoints for the first time since March. But passenger volumes across major U.S. airlines are still down about 65 percent from last year, according to the industry group Airlines for America, and are expected to remain deeply depressed for the foreseeable future.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Until we have widely-available vaccines and achieve herd immunity, we expect passenger traffic and booking trends to remain fragile,&#8221; Southwest&#8217;s chief executive, Gary C. Kelly, said in a statement. Doug Parker, American&#8217;s chief executive, agreed: &#8220;We have a long road ahead.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Southwest also said it would start filling planes to capacity again starting Dec. 1, after capping seats in the spring. Delta Air Lines is expected to stop blocking off middle seats in the first half of next year, its chief executive said last week. United Airlines and American are not limiting seats.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Flights in the United States are carrying an average of about 74 passengers each, down from about 99 last year, according to Airlines for America. Carriers are losing about $200 million per day; those losses are expected to shrink but will continue through the winter and into next year. American said it ended September with nearly $14 billion in cash and other available liquidity, while Southwest had more than $15 billion.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Airlines have survived the sustained slowdown by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/business/united-airlines-coronavirus.html" title="">tweaking operations</a>, making last-minute changes to flight schedules to match demand and slashing costs, largely by encouraging tens of thousands of industry workers to take buyouts or pay cuts. This month, United and American furloughed more than 32,000 workers. With hopes of a second federal stimulus seemingly dashed, the industry will have to make do with less as it prepares for what is widely expected to be a dismal winter.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/niraj-chokshi" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="new-state-unemployment-claims-fell-below-800000-last-week"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#new-state-unemployment-claims-fell-below-800000-last-week">New state unemployment claims fell below 800,000 last week.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Families at a food bank in Vallejo, Calif., on Wednesday.

As a result, some reductions in state jobless rolls may not mean that people are back at work, but rather that they have shifted to the federal program, Mr. Tedeschi said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The report will attract particular attention because it may hint at October&#8217;s unemployment rate, since the counting overlapped with the Labor Department&#8217;s monthly job survey.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patricia-cohen" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="complaints-about-social-media-scams-surged-in-the-pandemic-the-ftc-says"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#complaints-about-social-media-scams-surged-in-the-pandemic-the-ftc-says">Complaints about social media scams surged in the pandemic, the F.T.C. says.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="The Federal Trade Commission said reported losses from scams originating on social media, especially Facebook and Instagram, reached a record high of nearly $117 million in the first half of the year." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/business/22markets-brf-ftcscam/merlin_178854513_ad87aaea-10ed-4ac8-8174-386f90c66a9f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The Federal Trade Commission said reported losses from scams originating on social media, especially Facebook and Instagram, reached a record high of nearly $117 million in the first half of the year.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Johanna Geron/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The pandemic-fueled boom in online shopping has been accompanied by a spike in complaints about scams originating on social media, especially Facebook and Instagram, according to the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Reported losses from such fraud reached a record high of nearly $117 million in the first six months of 2020, compared with $134 million in all of 2019, the F.T.C. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2020/10/scams-starting-social-media-proliferate-early-2020#end4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Wednesday.</a> The top sources of complaints were e-commerce sites that never delivered goods to consumers, many of whom said they had found the sites through Facebook or Instagram, which Facebook owns.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;These scam ads look real and can be carefully targeted to reach a particular audience,&#8221; the trade commission said in a report. &#8220;The scammers can delete comments on their ads or posts so that negative responses don&#8217;t show up and alert people to the con.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">People also reported losing money through so-called romance scams, in which fraudsters develop online relationships with people to obtain money from them, and through social media messages that offer &#8220;supposed economic relief or income opportunities,&#8221; the F.T.C. said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The overall number of reports that people lost money to scams starting on social media in the second quarter more than tripled from a year earlier.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sapna-maheshwari" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="us-stock-futures-slip-as-weekly-jobless-data-is-released"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#us-stock-futures-slip-as-weekly-jobless-data-is-released">U.S. stock futures slip as weekly jobless data is released.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Wall Street in Manhattan, New York, on Oct. 2." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/business/22markets-brf-market/merlin_177959115_d5b22908-e1d8-409d-93ab-1b95af38660e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Wall Street in Manhattan, New York, on Oct. 2.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>John Taggart for The New York Times</p></p></p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">U.S. stock futures indicated that indexes on Wall Street would trade lower when markets opened on Thursday, following a decline yesterday.

Mr. Black and Apollo said Mr. Epstein did no work for the firm.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Tuesday, an Apollo spokeswoman said that the investment firm&#8217;s board had retained the law firm Dechert to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/business/leon-black-jeffrey-epstein-apollo.html" title="">conduct an independent review</a> of the dealings between Mr. Black and Mr. Epstein. Mr. Black has said he would cooperate with all legal inquiries.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The pension fund had initially been planning to meet with Apollo officials this week, but moved up the meeting after reading the Times report and Mr. Black&#8217;s letter, said Steve Esack, a spokesman for the retirement system.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;After that October 13th phone conversation, P.S.E.R.S.&#8217;s investment team informed Apollo that it will not consider any new investments at this time,&#8221; Mr. Esack said in an email. The retirement system &#8220;is closely following the ongoing legal issues and the newly launched internal Apollo investigation,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That means the fund&#8217;s existing investments with Apollo, worth $918 million, will remain intact and gradually decline as the projects they financed are completed and the money is returned to the teachers&#8217; pension fund. Pension fund commitments to private equity vehicles typically last for a number of years.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Other public pension funds that work with Apollo have not gone so far as to freeze investments.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Rob Maxwell, a spokesman for the Texas teachers&#8217; retirement system, said that fund had already been in touch with Apollo and was &#8220;closely monitoring the activities that the firm and its board are taking.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Wayne Davis, a spokesman for the California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System, said the fund called Apollo last week about Mr. Black&#8217;s relationship with Mr. Epstein and would continue to monitor the situation. The system expects its outside investment managers &#8220;to follow the same core values of integrity and accountability that guide our own investment decision-making,&#8221; Mr. Davis said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A spokesman for the Illinois teachers&#8217; pension system, David Urbanek, said it was &#8220;going to monitor this situation very closely as it continues to unfold,&#8221; but the trustees responsible for selecting and monitoring outside investment managers had not yet discussed the matter.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A spokeswoman for Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller who sits ex officio on the boards of pension funds serving teachers and other workers, said, &#8220;We are troubled by these reports, and we are closely monitoring the situation in accordance with our fiduciary duty and to protect the interests of our pensioners.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Shares of Apollo were up 2.6 percent on Wednesday, but are still down more than 12 percent since Oct. 12.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mary-williams-walsh" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Mary Williams Walsh</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-goldstein" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="catch-up-quibi-shuts-down-and-tesla-has-fifth-straight-profitable-quarter"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#catch-up-quibi-shuts-down-and-tesla-has-fifth-straight-profitable-quarter">Catch up: Quibi shuts down, and Tesla has fifth straight profitable quarter.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Meg Whitman&#8217;s presence as C.E.O. helped give Quibi legitimacy." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/business/21Quibi/merlin_166845585_af5c6d51-927f-467c-991d-edd4e3fcbf43-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Meg Whitman&#8217;s presence as C.E.O. helped give Quibi legitimacy.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Etienne Laurent/EPA, via Shutterstock</p></p></p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Quibi, the beleaguered short-form content company started by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/business/media/quibi-shutting-down.html" title="">announced on Wednesday that it was shutting down</a> just six months after the app became available, despite raising a combined $1.75 billion in cash from Hollywood studios, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and other investors.

It produced 145,000 vehicles, and had revenue of $8.7 billion.</p></li></ul><p class="css-j3uhc5"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-two-track-recovery-those-returning-to-jobs-and-those-who-dont-expect-to"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-two-track-recovery-those-returning-to-jobs-and-those-who-dont-expect-to">A two-track recovery: those returning to jobs and those who don&#8217;t expect to.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">People laid off or furloughed because of the pandemic increasingly fall into two categories: those who have returned to their old jobs, and those who doubt they ever will.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Just over half &#8212; 53 percent &#8212; of those who lost jobs during the coronavirus crisis have returned to work, according to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/nyt-october-2020-cci/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey conducted this month</a> for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey. That is up from 38 percent in August, and it is consistent with government data showing that the United States has regained a bit more than half the jobs lost last spring.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Among those still out of work, however, just 39 percent say they think they will go back to their old jobs.</p><p class="css-17dprlf"></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The gap between the two groups is stark. People who have returned to work say their finances have held up relatively well, and they are about as optimistic as people who never lost their jobs. Nearly one in four say their finances have improved in the past year, a possible reflection of the stimulus checks and extra unemployment benefits that helped workers early on in the pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Most who are still out of work, however, say their financial situation is worsening. A third say that their unemployment benefits have expired, or that they tried and failed to get benefits. As a group, the unemployed are pessimistic not just about their finances but about the economy as a whole.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Economists say those workers are right to worry.

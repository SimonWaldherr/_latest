Border agents last month recorded the highest number of apprehensions of people illegally crossing the southern border during any September since 2006, suggesting that harsh border enforcement measures put in place by the Trump administration at the beginning of the pandemic are doing little to deter migrants.

September also marked the end of fiscal 2020. CBP agents apprehended 54,771 migrants last month, bringing the yearly total to nearly 401,000 – less than half of the apprehensions seen in 2019 but roughly in line with encounters in the previous several years. The Trump administration has enacted a series of increasingly aggressive measures over the years aimed at dramatically reducing the number of migrants appearing at the southern border and ultimately let into the U.S.

The figures, released Wednesday by Customs and Border Protection, are the last to be published ahead of the presidential election. Immigration enforcement has been a pillar of President Donald Trump's presidency, and he is running his reelection campaign in part on his border security record. He has touted the number of border arrests – which is believed to correspond to the number of attempted illegal border crossings – at rallies. Apprehensions surged to the highest levels seen in over a decade in 2019 but gradually declined before the pandemic hit.

The recidivism rate, or the rate at which migrants reattempt to cross the border after being apprehended, has jumped, officials say, though the agency has not released data on reattempts. The number of apprehensions last month likely include a moderate share of migrants arrested more than once after making multiple border crossing attempts. According to The Washington Post, the recidivism rate was 30% in August, up from just 7% at the same time last year.

The recidivism rate is likely linked to pandemic-related border policies. Some 88% of the migrants encountered at the border last month were almost immediately expelled from the U.S. under a public health order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in late March that gives Border Patrol agents the authority to quickly deport both children and adults crossing the border illegally without processing or detaining them, bypassing the normal legal processes.

Since March, some 197,000 migrants have been immediately deported under the policy. It has been widely panned by advocates and some lawmakers, who point out that it has resulted in the explosion of asylum seekers and vulnerable children.

Top CDC officials said the policy would not help slow the spread of the coronavirus, but the agency's director, Robert Redfield, relented after Vice President Mike Pence directly ordered him to enact the policy, according to reports.

Officials have not said what metrics need to be met in order to lift the policy. Border crossings plummeted in April during the beginning of the pandemic but have gradually increased once more.

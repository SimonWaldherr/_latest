  Businesses urge Boris Johnson to introduce US-UK travel corridor 
description: > 
  Businesses responsible for bringing 4.5 million US visitors to the UK each year have written to Boris Johnson to demand a “travel corridor” that could revive up to half the £4.2bn trade.In their letter, Avanti’s chief executive Paul Barry, the owner of Cambridge United football club, and Joss Croft, chief executive of Ukinbound, urged the Prime Minister to introduce pre-departure testing 72 hours before flying, which could reduce quarantine by up to 12 days.They said such “travel corridors” had already been introduced between the US and Hawaii, and the US and Mexico, leading to a surge in travel between the destinations.They warned that US leisure and business travellers would switch to other European countries that already have testing regimes for arrivals if Britain delayed.The Government has set up a taskforce to consider testing for arrivals, which is due to report to the Prime Minister early next month.

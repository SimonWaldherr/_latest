From the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC until the 19th century, the history of Western engagement with Egypt was written by men. The opening years of Egyptology’s golden age, too, were led by male figures – scholars such as Jean-François Champollion (who deciphered hieroglyphics in 1822), John Gardner Wilkinson, Richard Lepsius and Auguste Mariette. But all that changed in the 1860s, thanks to one remarkable British woman: Lucie Duff Gordon.

She was a true pioneer who in 1863 took up residence in a ramshackle hovel on the roof of Luxor Temple. She called it her “Theban palace”, and it remained her home for six years. She was outspoken against the Egyptian state’s profligacy, to the point that her letters were intercepted by government agents. (On one occasion, officials tried to bribe Duff Gordon’s boatman into drowning her, but her local popularity saved her.) And when an epidemic swept the country in the spring of 1864, people preferred to visit Duff Gordon, not the government clinics, travelling up to 20 miles for treatment at the hands of this ‘wise woman’.

Lucie Austin was born in Westminster in 1821, the year before Champollion’s decipherment (the event which marked the birth of Egyptology). Her middle-class family was well-read and politically active: her father, John, was a noted intellectual, while her mother, Sarah, was unusually well-educated for a woman of the time and was a supporter of women’s emancipation.

As a girl, Lucie inherited her parents’ talents. A friend described her as “a great reader, a great thinker, very original in her conclusions, very eager in impressing her opinions… her mind was not like those of many women”. Brave the man who would marry such a free spirit. At Lucie’s first society ball, during her “coming out” season in London, her eyes fell upon the figure of Sir Alexander Duff Gordon, an impoverished baronet more than 10 years her senior.

Despite the age difference, the two fell in love and were married in 1840. With Lucie’s intellectual connections and Alexander’s aristocratic cachet, they enjoyed a wide circle of friends. Tennyson used to come and read his poems at their house in Westminster. Other visitors included the authors Macaulay, Dickens and Thackeray; the prime minister, Lord Melbourne; and the future emperor Napoleon III of France.

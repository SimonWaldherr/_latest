  Chris Pratt can go from the famous Chrises, according to Twitter 
description: > 
  (CNN) Twitter has decided that, if given a choice, it chooses to cancel Chris Pratt.It all started when TV writer/producer Amy Berg tweeted over the weekend, "One has to go," along with pictures of Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pine and Chris Evans.The tweet -- about the group known as the four famous Chrises -- elicited plenty of comment, with many saying Pratt had to go.Those who supported canceling Pratt cited everything from his allegedly being a Trump supporter to a claim last year that Pratt supported a church with anti-LGBTQ views.I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone."

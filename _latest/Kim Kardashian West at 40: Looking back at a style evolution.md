There were big waist belts and tiny halter tops, giant golden hoop earrings and skinny jeans worn with knee-high boots. Some of it was admittedly "tragic," as Kardashian West herself <a href="https://www.vogue.com/video/watch/kim-kardashian-west-life-in-looks-juicy-couture-skims-video?verso=true" target="_blank">recalled to Vogue</a> last year.</p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F201019112419-02-kim-kardashian-west-fashion-evolution-restricted.jpg" alt="Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in 2006."><p class="BasicArticle__caption">Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in 2006.  <p class="BasicArticle__credit">Credit: </p><p class="BasicArticle__credit">Christopher Polk/FilmMagic/Getty Images</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">But it proved that the budding influencer knew how to own -- and hone -- trends.

First popularized in the mid-to-late 90s by French label Herv&#233; L&#233;ger, the form-fitting, ultra-tight silhouette became a firm favorite -- as did its designer. She even had her wax figure at Madame Tussauds don a Herv&#233; L&#233;ger number, which she of course matched at its unveiling in New York in 2010. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"><h3>Transition to high fashion</h3></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">If one were to pinpoint the year Kardashian West began transitioning towards a sleeker style, it'd be 2012.

There's been lots of strategically placed sheer fabric, too, and Kardashian West has taken sheerness to the extreme by flaunting looks that came to be known as her "naked dresses." </p><a></a><a></a><p>Not all of her sartorial choices worked -- the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9iAJ9lOS3w/" target="_blank">Givenchy floral dress worn</a> to the 2013 Met Gala is still remembered today as "the couch dress." But the megastar has continued to prove that she is unafraid of pushing the envelope.

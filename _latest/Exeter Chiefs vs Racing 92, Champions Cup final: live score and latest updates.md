Racing secure the maul through Ryan. It goes down. Racing will have to carry this up. This is incredibly tense.

Racing not making much ground, yet. Exeter desperate for a turnover, looks as though Machenaud sealed off but no penalty. Could go for a drop goal? Vakatawa so close! A metre short. The ball's loose but Racing get it back.

We've had 16 phases already. Racing go wide but Imhoff is tackled. Now back to the middle. Penalty Exeter right on their own line! Extraordinary by Hidalgo-Clyne. Racing were inches away. Exeter find touch with the penalty. Vakatawa getting treatment near the Exeter line where he was stopped just short. His day is done.

The act of denying formerly incarcerated people the right to vote is deeply rooted in racism.

This no more apparent than in Florida, where racist voter supression strategies have made a comeback.

As we enter the last few weeks of the campaign, it's becoming more and more clear that one of the major stories of the 2020 presidential election will be the threat of voter suppression.

From restrictions on dropping off ballots to scam robocalls, the fight to have the voices of the people heard is one of the biggest stories in an election year full of big stories. But perhaps the best example of this fight comes from Florida.

A new way to use an old rule to block the vote

The act of denying formerly incarcerated persons the right to vote is rooted in racist practice. As the presidential election nears this practice is once again raising its ugly head in Florida, led by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Florida was one of three states to ban all formerly incarcerated people from voting. Mississippi and Virginia were the other two until they loosened some of those restrictions. But with Florida, history plays a big role. Following the Civil War, the state adopted laws that effectively "felonized" convictions of former slaves for minor crimes and, presto: It became easy to deny Blacks in Florida the right to vote.

And so it was until 2018 when a progressive attempt was made to rectify this discriminatory practice. Amendment 4 of Florida's constitutional initiative to grant voting rights to persons with felony convictions was approved by 64% of voters.

However, two months later the state Republicans and Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, inserted a requirement that returning citizens would face a "poll tax" requiring them to pay all fines and fees from their sentence before they could vote, a diabolical legislative move.

This tax is something scores of people can't feasibly resolve as there is no centralized database for feed and fines in the state. "There is no way of tracking who paid what for the last 40 years," activist Rev. Clifford Tyson said in an interview on "60 Minutes."

The move is incredibly important as Florida is a perennial swing state in presidential elections — the 2000 Bush vs Gore recount fiasco being the ultimate point of reference. So the current Republican-led initiative to subvert the votes of 1.5 million formerly incarcerated people could have massive implications. Florida is a must-win state for President Donald Trump's reelection bid and the ruling could influence the outcome in November — remember, back in 2000 the difference was just 500 votes.

A lower federal court initially provided relief. In May, District Court Judge Robert Hinkle called the state process used to determine a formerly incarcerated person's financial obligations "an administrative train wreck."

He blocked enforcement of that part of the law and permitted returning citizens unable to pay their fines to vote. But that was short-lived. Ultimately after some direction from the US Supreme Court, on September 11, the circuit court and obtained a favorable ruling from a court loaded with Trump appointees.

In September, the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit — heavily packed with Trump appointees — ruled in favor of Florida Republicans' push to make it harder for formerly incarcerated people to vote, affecting hundreds of thousands of potential voters.

The vestiges of entrenched racism are evident in the appallingly myopic view of the court's first sentence in its opinion: "Florida has long followed the common practice of excluding those who commit serious crimes from voting." To be clear, the "common practice" of felon disenfranchisement laws in the South is rooted in Jim Crow era constitutional and legislative initiatives specifically designed to deny Blacks the right to vote.

So, for now Jim Crow is back and is alive and well. After the Civil War and during the Reconstruction era, efforts to encourage suffrage were blocked not only by violence but also by pernicious legislative acts like those that we are seeing today in Florida. It's incredibly sad to see how racist conservatives are following in the footsteps of their hateful ancestors.

As a society, we aren't completely helpless. Former Presidential Candidate Michael Bloomberg has shown a path forward when he recently formed an initiative to raise funds to pay the fees of those who are able to access that essential information. He has so far spent $5 million to pay the fines and fees of 5,000 formerly incarcerated people.

While such efforts are inspiring, we need systemic change. Collective liberation is only guaranteed if we end voter disenfranchisement and the discrimination that has always driven it. Ensuring free and fair elections must be the Number 1 priority for a Biden administration and a Democratic-led Senate.

Of course, we must also eliminate discriminatory practices that disproportionately force Blacks into prison and create a cycle of recidivism due to a lack of social safety nets such as gainful employment and housing. The crucial first step in breaking that cycle is ensuring the right to vote, which is fundamental to our democracy and a right no American should be denied.

Florida's Amendment Four was a continuation of our Civil Rights battle; a lifelong fight to make sure all Americans will be counted. We can't let it be a paper tiger.

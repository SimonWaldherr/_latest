Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett plans to lay out her judicial approach in her Monday opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to a copy of her planned opening remarks obtained by USA TODAY.

"Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life," Barrett says in her planned remarks. "The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the People. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try."

Barrett plans to say she looks at every case "from the perspective of the losing party" and asks herself, "how I would view the decision if one of my children was the party I was ruling against."

The standard she sets in every case, she says, is: "Even though I would not like the result, would I understand that the decision was fairly reasoned and grounded in the law?"

She will also address the legacy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in mid-September, kicking off a battle to fill the Supreme Court seat.

"I have been nominated to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat, but no one will ever take her place. I will be forever grateful for the path she marked and the life she led," Barrett plans to say.

  Pollster who predicted 2016 says Donald Trump is on track to win again thanks to 'hidden' support 
description: > 
  The pollster who predicted the 2016 election result says Donald Trump is on track to win the presidency again bolstered by his 'hidden' support.Cahaly says those polls don't include Trump's 'hidden' fans who do not want to identify themselves by participating in polls for fear of retribution for supporting Trump.Trafalgar Group chief pollster Robert Cahaly says Trump is likely to be re-elected thanks to votes by his 'hidden' supporters.Now Cahaly says Trump will win Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Georgia, where most polls show a stalemate or show Biden with a slight lead.'What weâ€™ve noticed is that these polls are predominantly missing the hidden Trump vote, what we refer to as the shy Trump voter,' he said.

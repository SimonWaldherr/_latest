<strong>Result:</strong> Said Nurmagomedov def. Mark Striegl via knockout (punches) &#8211; Round 1, 0:51<br>

<p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/mark-striegl">Mark Striegl</a>&#8217;s UFC debut was over virtually before it had begun. The Filipino&#8217;s over-eagerness to step into the pocket and throw hands led to his downfall against the biggest betting favorite on the card, Said Nurmagomedov.</p>
<p>Striegl was clipped twice with slick counter shots from Nurmagomedov, but continued to push forward, regardless. He landed a couple of solid leg kicks, but when he looked to close the distance he paid the price in devastating fashion.</p>
<p>Striegl was badly hurt with a counter left hand as he stepped into the pocket throwing strikes and, while scrambled, attempted to grab a single-leg takedown.</p>
<p>Nurmagomedov overpowered him and put him on his back before finishing him with some nasty ground strikes. He was finished in just 51 seconds by the Dagestani bantamweight.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Striegl came in a little too hot, too early, and paid the price as the cooler, calmer head of Nurmagomedov prevailed with a quickfire finish.</p>
<p>The defeat sent Striegl to his first defeat since his submission loss to Australia&#8217;s Reece McLaren in ONE Championship in 2015. It was also the first time the Filipino had been finished with strikes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;ll be thrown in with such a highly rated opponent next time around, but regardless of the level of opposition, Striegl will need to lose some of the nervous energy that led to his downfall in his octagon debut.</p>

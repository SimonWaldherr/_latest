  Morgan Stanley's WhatsApp woes — Goldman stresses supply-chain security — Inside a 3D-printed home 
description: > 
  The Department of Justice filed its long-awaited antitrust case on Tuesday against Google for what it alleges are unfair advantages in search and online advertising.At first glance, this has little to do with Wall Street, beyond those who have made investments made in the tech space.However, it's worth considering how this might impact the overall push by Big Tech to get deeper into banking.But, with this latest case, it seems unlikely that anyone in Big Tech will make a considerable push into banking in the near term, lest they also catch the eye of regulators.If you're not yet a subscriber, you can sign up here to get your daily dose of the stories dominating banking, business, and big deals.

<p>Mark Zuckerberg signed off on a Facebook algorithm change in 2017 that throttled traffic to progressive news sites, costing journalism outlet Mother Jones hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-mark-zuckerberg-learned-politics-11602853200">a report by The Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ClaraJeffery/status/1317199501136859136">comments by Mother Jones senior staff</a> published Friday.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal report cited sources that said Facebook was concerned about negatively affecting conservative news outlets when it planned on changing the algorithm that governs users' news feeds in 2017. In turn, Mark Zuckerberg signed off on an alternative that targeted "left-leaning sites like Mother Jones...more than previously planned," WSJ reported.</p><p>Following Friday's report, Mother Jones editor in chief Clara Jeffrey slammed the social media company, estimating that the move cost the publication $400,000 to $600,000. In addition, Jeffrey, and Mother Jones editorial director Ben Dreyfuss, wrote that Facebook representatives had lied to them in meetings about the change in 2017. Dreyfuss tweeted that, "they just swore up and down that wasn't what was happening," on Friday.</p><p>"We did not make changes with the intent of impacting individual publishers," a Facebook spokesperson wrote in a statement to Business Insider on Friday. "We only made updates after they were reviewed by many different teams across many disciplines to ensure the rationale was clear and consistent and could be explained to all publishers."</p>

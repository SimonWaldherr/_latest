Newman!

Actor Wayne Knight, who played inept mailman Newman in “Seinfeld,” reprised his role as a carrier to accuse President Trump of a “premeditated assault on the US mail” in a new ad paid for by a Democratic super PAC.

Knight, dressed in a postal uniform and wearing a face mask, blasts Trump in the ad for a nationwide mail slowdown that hit the US in August, prior to November’s presidential election.

“There’s been a systematic, premeditated assault on the US mail by President Trump and his so-called Postmaster General — that guy’s never licked a stamp,” Knight says in the ad.

“They had the unmitigated gall to try to slow down the mail,” he adds. “When everyone knows the only person who can slow down the mail is a mailman.”

The PAC that paid for the ad, PACRONYM, bills itself as a digital-only campaign that is targeting voters in swing states to oust President Trump in the election.

The clip that featured Knight was going viral on Twitter Friday evening, with shares from celebrities including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who played Elaine on “Seinfeld.”

“They’ve got missing mailboxes. They’re decommissioning sweet, sweet sorting machines to try to delay voting by mail,” Knight adds in the clip.

“And it’s not just your mail-in ballots you gotta worry about. Oh, no, no, no. You gotta worry about your grandma’s blood pressure medicine,” he says.

Trump has repeatedly blasted mail-in voting in the election, claiming it will lead to widespread voter fraud.

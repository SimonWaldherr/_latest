A woman who was refused an in-person GP appointment during lockdown has been told she has just six months to live.

Ellie Krzywy, 62, was diagnosed with lung cancer in August after experiencing chronic cough.

When her cough first emerged in June, her daughter Marina Sendall tried to book an appointment.

But Ms Sendall, 33, claims Gloucester Health Centre in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, "didn't want to see" patients during the pandemic.

Ms Krzywy was prescribed antibiotics in two separate telephone consultations in June as doctors believed she had a chest infection.

However, when she started suffering with severe breathlessness and her lips turned blue, she requested a face-to-face visit.

She had to take a Covid-19 test before a paramedic could see her and once she tested negative she was visited.

The practitioner found the oxygen levels in her blood had plummeted.

They also discovered her right lung was silent and referred her for an x-ray, which had a fortnight waiting list and an additional seven-day wait for results.

Ms Sendall rushed her mum to A&E on August 1, which is when doctors told them she had small cell lung cancer and had just six months to live.

The mum-of-four said she was "very disappointed" that she was refused a face-to-face doctor appointment while suffering from cancer.

Her daughter has accused the GP of using Covid as an "excuse" not to see the patient and has claimed the doctors who refused to see her have robbed the family of precious time together.

She claimed booking appointments was already difficult even before lockdown.

She added: "If my mum was seen when she first called we probably would have had a different outcome, but at this point it had spread.

"Maybe she wouldn't have had a brilliant prognosis but we definitely would have had a lot more time with her.

"My mum was completely dismissed when she finally got a face-to-face appointment."

Cleaner Ms Krzywy began chemotherapy that is due to finish at the end of this month following a biopsy and CT scan.

A spokesperson from NHS Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group said: "We are very sorry to hear about this patient's experiences and that the lady concerned and her daughter are unhappy with the service provided.

"We have been working very closely with our GP surgeries throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that appropriate arrangements and safeguards are in place to see patients face to face if their medical need requires it."

Earlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed cancer patients will only be guaranteed treatment if Covid-19 stays "under control".

The Health Secretary claimed that it was “critical for everybody to understand the best way to keep cancer services running is to suppress the disease”.

It came as furious hospital bosses warned such messages “could cost lives” by giving the impression they were running a “Covid-only service”.

Mr Hancock told MPs that controlling the virus would allow the NHS to “recover the treatment that we need to for cancer and other killer diseases”.

The latest figures showed that 15,166 new coronavirus cases were announced yesterday, bringing the total in the UK to 590,844.

Another 81 deaths from Covid-19 were recorded across Britain, taking the tragic total to 42,760.

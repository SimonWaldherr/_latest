<p>Heathrow Airport will today commence pre-departure Covid-19 testing for passengers travelling to Hong Kong and Italy.&#160;</p>
<p>The rapid-result tests will be carried out at the airport&#8217;s purpose-built testing facility&#160;in Terminal&#160;2, and later in Terminal 5. They will cost &#163;80, and provide results in approximately one hour.&#160;</p>
<p>The service will initially offer LAMP testing, but will expand to offer antigen testing in the coming weeks, The Telegraph understands. Unlike PCR tests &#8211; which are used by the NHS &#8211; LAMP and antigen tests can be processed without being sent to a laboratory.</p>
<p>Announcing the launch, aviation services company Collinson and logistics firm Swissport described the pre-departure testing regime as the "crucial next step toward keeping the travel industry moving while limiting the spread of the virus".</p>
<p>The service will initially be open for four weeks; tests can be booked online, prior to airport arrival.</p>

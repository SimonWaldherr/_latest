description: > 
  ET 2020 Election Live Updates: Deadlocked Supreme Court Allows Extra Time for Mail-In Voting in Pennsylvania The debate commission will mute President Trump and Joe Biden during portions of Thursday’s debate.Mr. Trump and his aides have signaled deep hostility to any outside control of the candidates’ microphones during the debates.They’re trying to talk people out of voting,” Mr. Trump added.Later, the ad says Mr. Trump is “developing a vaccine in record time.” While potential vaccines may arrive in record time, they are being developed by private companies, not by Mr. Trump or his administration.Mr. Trump is a prime example of both of these issues.” At 75, Mr. Fogerty is one year older than Mr. Trump, who avoided military service during the draft by claiming he had a foot problem.

The state is a key battleground in the presidential election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Supreme Court&#8217;s action was the result of a deadlock. It takes five votes to grant a stay, and the Republicans who had asked the court to intervene could only muster four: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. On the other side of the divide were Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the court&#8217;s three-member liberal wing: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Neither side gave reasons. The result suggested that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump&#8217;s Supreme Court nominee, could play a decisive role in election disputes if &#8212; as Republicans hope &#8212; she joins the court before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She is expected to be confirmed by the Senate next week.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The ruling in the Pennsylvania case is a major victory for Democrats in the state who have been pushing to expand access to voting in the pandemic, and for a party that has been requesting absentee ballots at far greater numbers than Republicans. As of Friday, Democrats in Pennsylvania had requested 1,755,940 ballots, and Republicans had requested 672,381, according to data from the Pennsylvania secretary of state&#8217;s office.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Of course, the extra time could result in further delays in reporting results; Pennsylvania is already expected to be one of the last states to have voting results, since a state law prevents election officials from beginning to process ballots until Election Day, and Republicans in the state legislature have indicated that they will not be offering any relief to give them more time.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Supreme Court decision also removes one more legal hurdle related to elections in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state with numerous voting-related lawsuits still undecided, including one about whether election officials will have to perform signature matching on absentee ballots.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-liptak" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Adam Liptak</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nick-corasaniti" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="taking-aim-at-interruptions-the-debate-commission-will-mute-trump-and-biden-during-portions-of-thursdays-debate"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#taking-aim-at-interruptions-the-debate-commission-will-mute-trump-and-biden-during-portions-of-thursdays-debate">Taking aim at interruptions, the debate commission will mute Trump and Biden during portions of Thursday&#8217;s debate.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R.

Biden Jr. will be muted during portions of Thursday&#8217;s final presidential debate, an effort by the organizers to avoid the unruly spectacle that played out at the candidates&#8217; first meeting in Cleveland last month.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As in the first debate, each candidate will be allotted two minutes of speaking time to initially answer the moderator&#8217;s questions. But under a plan announced on Monday by the Commission on Presidential Debates, his opponent&#8217;s microphone will be turned off during that period, an attempt to ensure an uninterrupted response.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After the candidates finish their two-minute replies, they will be allowed to freely engage with one another for the remainder of the segment. (The debate is divided into six segments of 15 minutes apiece.)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Aides to Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump were notified of the change late Monday, and the commission acknowledged that the campaigns might be not be entirely thrilled.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We realize, after discussions with both campaigns, that neither campaign may be totally satisfied with the measures announced today,&#8221; the commission said in a statement. &#8220;One may think they go too far, and one may think they do not go far enough. We are comfortable that these actions strike the right balance and that they are in the interest of the American people, for whom these debates are held.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Thursday debate in Nashville, to be moderated by Kristen Welker of NBC News, marks the final meeting of the campaign between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden. The debate commission had pledged to curtail the chaos that ensued at last month&#8217;s first debate in Cleveland, when Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/politics/trump-biden-debate.html" title="">frequently interrupted</a> Mr. Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump and his aides have signaled deep hostility to any outside control of the candidates&#8217; microphones during the debates. In a letter on Monday to the Debate Commission, sent before the announcement of the new rules, the president&#8217;s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said it would be &#8220;completely unacceptable&#8221; for &#8220;an unnamed person&#8221; to shut off a candidate&#8217;s microphone.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;A decision to proceed with that change amounts to turning further editorial control of the debate over to the commission,&#8221; Mr. Stepien wrote, going on to baselessly accuse the nonpartisan commission of bias toward Mr. Biden.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The commission&#8217;s proposal could also create the potential for technical gaffes. Mr. Trump&#8217;s voice, for instance, may be picked up by Mr. Biden&#8217;s microphone, and vice versa, meaning that an attempted interruption still may be heard, at least faintly, by viewers watching at home.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After the Cleveland debate, the commission released a statement saying that &#8220;additional structure should be added to the format of the remaining debates to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues.&#8221; But the organizers were slow to agree on any new rules, particularly after a tumultuous week in which an attempt to convert the second debate in Miami into a virtual event prompted Mr. Trump to withdraw. The second debate was eventually canceled, and each candidate held a televised town hall with voters instead.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the letter, Mr. Stepien &#8212; who mockingly referred to the nonpartisan commission as the &#8220;Biden Debate Commission&#8221; in a tweet &#8212; claimed the commission had &#8220;promised&#8221; that the Nashville debate would be about foreign policy and asked for it to discard the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.debates.org/2020/10/16/moderator-announces-topics-for-oct-22-presidential-debate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">six subjects announced last week by the moderator, Ms. Welker</a>. They are &#8220;fighting Covid-19,&#8221; &#8220;American families,&#8221; &#8220;race in America,&#8221; climate change, national security and leadership.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is true that in some campaign years, the third presidential debate has focused on foreign policy. But the debate organizers did not announce such a plan in 2020, saying that the third debate would mirror the format of the first, with six subjects selected by the moderator.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The debate commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Biden spokesman, T. J. Ducklo, said earlier on Monday that Mr. Stepien sent the letter &#8220;because Donald Trump is afraid to face more questions about his disastrous Covid response.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The campaigns and the commission agreed months ago that the debate moderator would choose the topics,&#8221; Mr. Ducklo said in a statement.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-m-grynbaum" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-fauci"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-fauci">Trump calls Fauci &#8216;a disaster&#8217; in a campaign call, then repeats his attacks before a rally in Arizona.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Dr. Anthony S.

Fauci, the nation&#8217;s leading infectious disease specialist, as &#8220;a disaster&#8221; on Monday and said, despite experts&#8217; warnings that the nation was headed toward another peak in the coronavirus outbreak, that people were &#8220;tired&#8221; of hearing about the virus and wanted to be left alone.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president issued his first broadsides against Dr. Fauci on Monday morning during a call with campaign staff that reporters listened in on, but then amplified them on Twitter and in remarks to reporters after landing in Arizona for a pair of rallies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;People are tired of hearing Fauci and these idiots, all these idiots who got it wrong,&#8221; Mr. Trump said in the call with campaign staff, which began with his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, talking about the Republican ground game and other factors that he said supported Mr. Trump&#8217;s path to victory.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also called Dr. Fauci a &#8220;nice&#8221; guy, but he said, &#8220;He&#8217;s been here for 500 years,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Every time he goes on television, there&#8217;s always a bomb, but there&#8217;s a bigger bomb if you fire him. This guy&#8217;s a disaster.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The attack on Dr. Fauci comes as the United States has seen more coronavirus cases &#8212; over 8 million &#8212; and more deaths &#8212; nearly 220,000 &#8212; than<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html" title=""> any other nation in the world</a>.  The president&#8217;s advisers have tried to get him to lay off the infectious diseases specialist, who remains popular.  </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It also comes after Dr. Fauci, in an interview with &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; that aired on Sunday, dismissed the president&#8217;s claim that the end of the pandemic was just around the corner. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fauci-no-surprised-trump-covid-19-media-appearances-60-minutes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Fauci said during the interview</a> that he was not surprised that Mr. Trump had contracted the virus, citing the failure to take basic precautions at White House events, including the announcement of Judge Amy Coney Barrett&#8217;s nomination to the Supreme Court.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,&#8221; Dr. Fauci said. &#8220;When I saw that on TV, I said, &#8216;Oh my goodness. Nothing good can come out of that, that&#8217;s got to be a problem.&#8217; And then sure enough, it turned out to be a superspreader event.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"> And after &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; reported that the Trump administration had restricted Dr. Fauci&#8217;s media appearances, Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1318252736538767360?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struck back on Twitter</a>. In a pair of tweets, he complained that Dr. Fauci &#8220;seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope,&#8221; adding, &#8220;All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions.&#8221; The president also criticized Dr. Fauci for &#8220;perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He continued his criticism of Dr. Fauci after landing in Arizona for the first of two scheduled rallies in the state, which is experiencing a rise in coronavirus cases.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Speaking to reporters after deplaning Air Force One, Mr. Trump called Dr. Fauci &#8220;a very nice man&#8221; but complained that he &#8220;loves being on television&#8221; and has made &#8220;a lot of bad calls.&#8221; Asked why he didn&#8217;t fire Dr. Fauci, Mr. Trump said, &#8220;He&#8217;s been there for about 350 years. I don&#8217;t want to hurt him.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump&#8217;s attacks on Dr. Fauci led Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee to become the latest Republican to distance himself from the president. &#8220;Dr. Fauci is one of our country&#8217;s most distinguished public servants,&#8221; said Mr. Alexander, who is retiring this year. &#8220;He has served six presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan. If more Americans paid attention to his advice, we&#8217;d have fewer cases of Covid-19, and it would be safer to go back to school and back to work and out to eat.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump has  bristled at Dr. Fauci&#8217;s superior approval ratings. A poll released late last month by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2020/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">68 percent of Americans trusted Dr. Fauci</a> either a great deal or a fair amount to provide reliable information about the virus, while only 40 percent trusted Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Maggie Haberman</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="democrats-fail-in-an-effort-to-shut-down-senate-business-in-protest-of-the-barrett-nomination-but-vow-to-try-again"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#democrats-fail-in-an-effort-to-shut-down-senate-business-in-protest-of-the-barrett-nomination-but-vow-to-try-again">Democrats fail in an effort to shut down Senate business in protest of the Barrett nomination, but vow to try again.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The Senate minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, on Monday tried to shut down the Senate to delay movement on confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, tried to shut down the Senate on Monday in protest of President Trump&#8217;s push to install Judge Amy Coney Barrett, his Supreme Court nominee, before Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Schumer called for the chamber to adjourn until after the November election, unless an elusive deal is reached on a stimulus measure to address the ongoing toll of the pandemic. His effort &#8212; a largely symbolic move designed to showcase the rush to confirm Judge Barrett &#8212; failed on a party-line vote, but it suggested that Democrats plan to use procedural tactics aimed at slowing or stopping the move in the days to come, spotlighting the rush to confirm her as they make their closing arguments to voters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We are not going to have business as usual here in the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Schumer said. &#8220;Their abuse of the Supreme Court process means we will not have business as usual &#8212; not now, not until Republicans stop their mad dash to confirm a Supreme Court justice mere days before a presidential election.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Judiciary Committee is scheduled on Thursday to approve the nomination of Judge Barrett, a constitutional originalist who personally opposes abortion rights and styles herself in the mold of the archconservative former justice, Antonin Scalia.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, planned to advance the nomination over the weekend in time for a final vote on Oct. 26, just over a week before the election.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="pelosi-and-mnuchin-are-racing-against-a-tuesday-deadline-for-a-new-stimulus-deal"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#pelosi-and-mnuchin-are-racing-against-a-tuesday-deadline-for-a-new-stimulus-deal">Pelosi and Mnuchin are racing against a Tuesday deadline for a new stimulus deal.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, held their latest talks, speaking for nearly an hour by phone on Monday afternoon. </p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California on Monday instructed Democratic committee chairmen to work with the top Republicans on their panels to try to resolve critical differences holding up a broad stimulus deal with the Trump administration, racing against a self-imposed Tuesday deadline for a compromise that could be considered before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The directive came after she and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, held their latest talks, speaking for nearly an hour by phone on Monday afternoon. The two &#8220;continued to narrow their differences,&#8221; Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi said, adding, &#8220;the speaker continues to hope that, by the end of the day Tuesday, we will have clarity on whether we will be able to pass a bill before the election.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The odds of a last-minute deal remain long, with Democrats and the Trump administration still haggling over funding levels and policy issues. Even if they could agree, Senate Republicans have all but ruled out embracing a plan anywhere near as large as the more than $2 trillion package under discussion.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">If such a deal were struck, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the chamber would consider it, but he also made a point of scheduling two separate votes in the coming days on narrower bills of the kind senators in his party are more willing to accept. One would revive a lapsed federal loan program for small businesses and the other would provide $500 billion for schools, testing and expired unemployment benefits.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump has insisted in recent days that he wants to spend more than the $2.4 trillion Ms. Pelosi has put forward in negotiations, and claimed he could easily cajole enough Senate Republicans into supporting an agreement of that size &#8212; a notion that many of them have told his top deputies would never happen.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a private call with Democrats on Monday, Ms. Pelosi outlined a number of remaining areas of disagreement, including Democratic demands for hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for state and local governments, support for restaurants devastated by the pandemic and additional health provisions, according to a person on the call, who disclosed the details on condition of anonymity. Democrats also remain wary that the administration would spend the funds as Congress intended.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Ms. Pelosi insisted she was optimistic a bargain could be reached and said she was intent on reaching one before a new Democratic administration began in January.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to carry over the droppings of this grotesque elephant into the next presidency,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi told her members. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get something big, and we&#8217;ve got to get it done soon and we&#8217;ve got to get it done right.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="in-arizona-trump-says-the-state-is-doing-great-with-the-pandemic-even-as-cases-tick-up-again"></p><p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70">THE STATE OF THE STATES</p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#in-arizona-trump-says-the-state-is-doing-great-with-the-pandemic-even-as-cases-tick-up-again">In Arizona, Trump says the state is &#8216;doing great with the pandemic&#8217; even as cases tick up again.</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">President Trump complained about CNN and its continuous coverage of the coronavirus pandemic during a campaign rally in Prescott, Ariz., on Monday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Doug Mills/The New York Times</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump told voters in Arizona that Americans are &#8220;getting tired of the pandemic&#8221; and accused the media of exaggerating the crisis, as he sought to make up ground in a traditionally Republican state where the virus is making a comeback.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Your state is doing great with the pandemic,&#8221; Mr. Trump said. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting tired of the pandemic, aren&#8217;t they?

The first half lashes out at Mr. Biden, accusing him of having &#8220;no real plan&#8221; for the virus and charging that his response has been to &#8220;criticize, complain and surrender.&#8221;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A new Trump ad on the coronavirus features the president wearing a mask <a href="https://t.co/oQwQdfLr19">pic.twitter.com/oQwQdfLr19</a></p>&#8212; Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaneGoldmacher/status/1318281583342850048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Then the music shifts as the narrator declares &#8220;President Trump is leading&#8221; as he appears in multiple scenes wearing a mask, which he has mostly avoided doing in public, including after he contracted the coronavirus.

And we will defeat this virus.&#8221;</p><h3 class="css-5lxzui e1gnsphs0" id="link-630f084a"><p>Fact Check</p></h3><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The ad&#8217;s declaration that Mr. Biden &#8220;has no real plan to defeat the coronavirus&#8221; is not accurate.

The ad also quotes Mr. Biden from earlier this year accusing Mr. Trump of &#8220;hysterical xenophobia&#8221; after he imposed a travel ban from China. Mr. Biden made the comments the day the ban was imposed, according to PolitiFact, though the words were not explicitly tied to the travel restriction.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Later, the ad says Mr. Trump is &#8220;developing a vaccine in record time.&#8221; While potential vaccines may arrive in record time, they are being developed by private companies, not by Mr. Trump or his administration.</p><h3 class="css-5lxzui e1gnsphs0" id="link-6ed99407"><p>Where It&#8217;s Running</p></h3><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The ad began airing over the weekend in some key presidential battlegrounds, including Arizona, where Mr. Trump campaigned on Monday, and in Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Maine.</p><h3 class="css-5lxzui e1gnsphs0" id="link-6991c40e"><p>The Takeaway</p></h3><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump is seeking to gain political ground on one of the key issues that has undermined his support in 2020.

Democrats also led Republicans in voter registration in several key states in 2016 that they ended up losing.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Trump-Biden contest this fall may be driven less by incremental changes in registration than by who turns out to vote, and how much they want the president to have a second term, or not.

Our video shows how states&#8217; responses to Russian hacking and the coronavirus crisis have helped make the election more secure than ever.</h4><dl class="css-p98d0w"><dt class="css-xx7kwh"></dt><dd class="css-12tddc8"><p class="css-8hvvyd">Voting machines. Our democracy depends on them to accurately record each and every ballot. You go to the polls, you cast your vote, your voice is heard. Right? Not so fast. &#8220;Russian attacks.&#8221; &#8220;Russian hackers.&#8221; &#8220;Russian hackers tried to break into U.S. election systems.&#8221; Because in 2016 &#8212; &#8220;The Russians managed to get us paranoid about the security of our own election systems.&#8221; But this year, experts are more confident that &#8212; &#8220;I think it is safe to say this is the most secure election we&#8217;ve ever held in the United States.&#8221; In 2016, Russians infiltrated our voting systems in every single state. &#8220;This was one of the most successful intelligence operations in modern history.&#8221; Now, there&#8217;s no evidence Russians altered votes, but &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s as if a cat burglar got into your house, cased the joint, but didn&#8217;t take anything.&#8221; And it raised the question &#8212; &#8220;Could the Russians actually affect the vote?&#8221; But because of some of the machines we were using, we didn&#8217;t know for sure. So in 2020, if there&#8217;s another cyberattack, Americans want to know that their vote was counted as they cast it. Like, say, with a &#8212; &#8220;Voter-verified paper trail.&#8221; Yes, like that. A paper trail. Turns out a few people tried to make this happen years ago, but &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s a rough world out there in the elections voting system business.&#8221; To see why it took Russia&#8217;s hacking to improve our voting technology, we go to Texas. The Constitution gives states power to run their own elections, and most states give counties the power to choose their own voting machines. And nowhere is this more apparent than in &#8212; &#8220;Texas.&#8221; &#8220;Texas.&#8221; &#8220;Texas &#8212;&#8221; [mooing] &#8220;&#8212; is a microcosm of all the different voting technologies used everywhere in the U.S. Every different Texas county, different voting system, different procedures.&#8221; Dan Wallach is a computer scientist at Rice University in Houston, and he had actually been warning about the vulnerabilities of our voting system long before 2016. &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about evil software in the machines flipping your vote in a way that you, the voter, can&#8217;t tell that the machine was evil.&#8221; He was most concerned about direct recording electronic voting machines, or DREs. &#8220;The only record of your vote is inside the memory of that machine. And that means that if something tampers with that electronic memory, you have no way to go back.&#8221; And yet in the last presidential election, 28 percent of registered voters used these machines. So how did some Americans get stuck with these vulnerable voting machines? Well, to find out, we need to go all the way back to 2000. The aught. Florida. It was Al Gore versus George Bush for president. &#8220;Oh my goodness. 2000. That was the election that we all thought would never end. &#8220;The presidential race is crackling like a hickory fire here. Couldn&#8217;t be much closer.&#8221; A contested vote, a recount and all of it came down to the chads. Those pesky fragments of paper leftover when a hole is punched in a card. Not all those chads were entirely punched through, though. &#8220;There was a hanging chad.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s slightly detached.&#8221; &#8220;Pregnant chad.&#8221; &#8220;Dimpled chad.&#8221; &#8220;Opening and closing chad.&#8221; During the recount, poll workers were left to determine voter intent, and all eyes were on the chads. &#8220;By that time, we all knew what a bad system punch-card voting was.&#8221; &#8220;In the wake of the hanging chad issues, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002. The Help America Vote Act allocated billions of dollars to help states replace antiquated voting machines.&#8221; And the states went shopping. Some bought hand-marked paper ballots and optical scanners. And others bought the machines that had worried Dan the most. The very modern, paperless DREs. &#8220;If it were up to me today, and if I were selling voting technology, I would not sell a paperless DRE system in good conscience. I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do.&#8221; This is Eddie Perez. He used to sell these machines, but left the industry to advocate for more secure voting systems with a paper trail. &#8220;I would characterize the level of federal regulation for voting technology as relatively thin. There are a lot of products that are actually more highly regulated than voting technology. Even things as mundane as ballpoint pens. Parts fail, systems get old, screens stop performing the way they are supposed to. So a voter might touch one portion of the screen to mark one candidate and the system interprets it as a choice for someone else.&#8221; &#8220;It is not letting me vote for who I want to vote for.&#8221; &#8220;There is plenty of voting equipment that is still out there whose design dates, probably, all the way back to 20 years ago.&#8221; But with most of their federal money spent, many Texas counties were stuck. &#8220;We kept our electronic voting system for 18 years.&#8221; As Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir is responsible for picking the machines for voters in Austin. &#8220;The thing that was most important to our voters was to have a paper trail. But none of the voting system manufacturers would build a system with a paper trail. And it was frustrating.&#8221; And so she decided to build one herself. &#8220;I was watching a video of a professor out of Rice University rake me over the coals.&#8221; &#8220;Such blatant security flaws. I mean, just really bad engineering.&#8221; &#8220;Instead of just getting mad, I went to that person.&#8221; &#8220;My phone rings and it&#8217;s Dana, and she says, &#8216;I want your help.&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;And I said to him, &#8216;Let&#8217;s you and I design a voting system together.&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m like, seriously? All right. Can I invite my friends? We hacked up an inkjet printer and a bunch of other cheap hardware mashed into a custom steel box that we built, and we came up with a really great design.&#8221; They called it S.T.A.R. Vote. &#8220;Computer scientists love to make acronyms out of words. First we come up with the acronym, then we try to find the words that fit.&#8221; &#8220;Secure.&#8221; &#8220;Transparent.&#8221; &#8220;Auditable.&#8221; &#8220;Reliable.&#8221; &#8220;A combination of both electronic and paper voting paper voting methods.&#8221; &#8220;S.T.A.R. Vote.&#8221; A new electronic voting machine with paper backup ballots that help with verification and audit. An open-source system which makes it more secure and cheaper for taxpayers. The end product, a newer, safer voting machine. &#8220;What we were actually doing was a start-up business. And I don&#8217;t think we really realized that at the outset.&#8221; Designing a machine is one thing. Finding someone to manufacture it is another. &#8220;The voting system industry is a couple hundred million dollars a year. That&#8217;s a teeny tiny market.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to get in the marketplace, and they don&#8217;t welcome anybody else coming in.&#8221; In a small market, there&#8217;s not much room for competition. Just three companies dominate the voting machine industry. &#8220;Those three major vendors are the ones that have carved out their space and made their commitment to it. And so they actually wield a lot of power in that industry.&#8221; &#8220;That market doesn&#8217;t leave a whole lot of room for companies to do innovative design and development.&#8221; &#8220;Voting technology is simply very, very slow to change.&#8221; &#8220;Current electronic voting machines have little or no security built in. Please help me and other elections administrators who want to do a better job. What we are designing is an electronic voting system. We&#8217;re ready to start building S.T.A.R. Vote.&#8221; In 2016, Dana DeBeauvoir had reached the final stages of the S.T.A.R. Vote design when reports that &#8230; &#8220;The intelligence services of a foreign power intervened on a scale never seen before.&#8221; &#8230; shook America&#8217;s confidence in its voting system. It seemed like the perfect moment for new players like S.T.A.R. Vote, who&#8217;d spent years thinking about how to get voters to trust their election results. &#8220;Since we had done all the design work for them, we thought one of the regular manufacturers would pick this up. Travis County put it out to bid. Most of the big manufacturers submitted bids. However, they submitted bids that were more along the lines of, buy what we already have.&#8221; She says the vendors rejected a key security component of S.T.A.R. Vote. &#8220;Open-source software.&#8221; Good for transparency, but having free source code means companies can&#8217;t charge as much. &#8220;Open-source systems &#8212; at least the way this one was designed, and in most cases &#8212; are low-revenue software projects.&#8221; They all passed. With the 2020 election around the corner, Dana still had all those aging DREs, so she was &#8212; &#8220;Running out of time. At that point, we realized that we had reached the end of our possibilities with S.T.A.R. Vote. It was probably the lowest time in my entire career. We had the secret recipe for pulling everybody together, and we still hadn&#8217;t made it happen.&#8221; But bigger changes were happening nationally. After 2016, voting systems were declared part of the country&#8217;s critical infrastructure &#8212; like dams and power plants. This meant new federal scrutiny of how Americans cast their vote for the first time since 2000. &#8220;And the voting machine manufacturers began to get the message.&#8221; &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;They began to move towards systems that had paper backup because they recognized that the political pressure was tremendous.&#8221; In 2018, Congress gave the states more money to fortify their systems and required a paper trail for all newly purchased voting machines. &#8220;Six months after we got the bad news that no one was going to build S.T.A.R. Vote for us, we got a dramatic turnaround in the industry for voting systems. They had in fact built a new voting system with electronic support and a paper trail. My thrill was a little bit tempered by the frustration of knowing that they could have done it years before.&#8221; And so Travis County joins battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, and went shopping. Again. &#8220;A lot of money.&#8221; And paper is the reason experts are saying 2020 may be the most secure election we&#8217;ve ever held. It&#8217;s not just about the voting machines. A greater number of e-poll books &#8212; which are used to check-in voters on Election Day &#8212; will also have a paper backup system. &#8220;And that&#8217;s why the Department of Homeland Security has spent a year trying to get cities and towns across America to print out those e-poll books to make sure that they had multiple backups of their registration systems.&#8221; A process moved further along by the pandemic. &#8220;You know in an odd way, the coronavirus crisis has helped us some in our election crises.&#8221; It&#8217;s pushed many states to shift to mail-in voting, which offers an automatic paper backup. In 2020, because of states buying new voting systems and the increase in vote-by-mail, an estimated 95 percent of voters will use auditable paper ballots. That&#8217;s not to say the shift to paper has been problem-free. Some states bought machines that produce a barcode for a paper ballot, which makes it harder for voters to verify. &#8220;The paper that comes out of the machine &#8212; machine-marked paper &#8212; has a barcode on it that is the official vote. No human can read a barcode.&#8221; And in various states, there have been printing errors on mail-in ballots. &#8220;There&#8217;s a different name on the ballot that you&#8217;re supposed to send in.&#8221; Still, when it comes to hacking and widespread fraud, experts agree that paper &#8212; through mail-in voting or with a voter verified paper trail &#8212; is as safe as it gets. &#8220;Having a paper ballot mailed to more and more Americans means there is a traceable way for people to vote. And a way for election monitors to audit later on that those votes were counted the way they were cast. And that they were cast by people eligible to vote.&#8221; The nation&#8217;s voting system is safer than it was four years ago, but some counties didn&#8217;t make the transition and could be more vulnerable. &#8220;The only states with significant amounts of non-paper digital ballots are states like, honestly, Texas.&#8221; Texas, a potential swing state for 2020, lags behind the rest of the country in election security. Harris County, the third largest county in the nation, wasn&#8217;t able to purchase new machines and still has their DREs from 2006. And with the Texas Supreme Court refusing to expand absentee voting and by allowing only one drop box per county, it puts extra pressure on the machines to function smoothly on Election Day. &#8220;A perception hack is a hack that is just big enough to create the illusion of a broad cyberattack. Because if they can manipulate some votes, registration systems, e-poll books, in just a few places, people will assume that they did so everywhere. That&#8217;s the beauty of a perception hack. And four years later, The psychological import of what the Russians did may be greater than anything that they actually hacked into, because they have managed to shake the confidence of American voters that their votes will be counted as they cast them.&#8221; This is Alex. And I&#8217;m Kassie. We produced this episode of &#8220;Stressed Election.&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot going on this election, and we want to make sure we take a deep dive into the major issues.

The group didn&#8217;t track elections as a source of stress before that &#8212; but that&#8217;s in part because psychologists weren&#8217;t hearing all that much about it.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I would rank 2020 very high in the list of stressful elections, certainly in the top five, if not the top three,&#8221; said Bruce J. Schulman, a professor of history at Boston University.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Of course, elections have always been somewhat stressful. The election of 1860 was a catalyst for Civil War. The election of 1932 took place in the midst of the Great Depression, when many Americans were hungry and homeless.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But only the most recent elections have come in the digital age. And now, during an especially bitter campaign, Mr. Trump is routinely making news on Twitter and people are getting updates pushed to their smartphones day and night. (In 2012, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 4 in 10 American adults</a> reported owning a smartphone, half the rate of today.)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And no other election has taken place during a widespread, modern-era pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The pandemic has disrupted so much of daily life, even more than a war or depression would,&#8221; Dr. Schulman said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">More people are calling therapists like Steven Stosny, a relationship expert in Maryland who used to get one to two emergency calls a week and now is getting as many as five a day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Stosny, who coined the term <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/us/politics/election-stress-disorder.html" title="">&#8220;election stress disorder&#8221; four years ago</a>, said that the background anxiety from the pandemic and the election has translated to far more stress in the daily lives of his clients, who are cooped up at home and already on edge.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;People have shorter fuses,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/fashion/the-elections-over-are-you-still-losing-it.html" title="">saw a similar phenomenon in 2004</a>, after the race between John Kerry and George Bush.

<p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I wrote this song because, as a veteran, I was disgusted that some people were allowed to be excluded from serving our country because they had access to political and financial privilege,&#8221; Mr. Fogerty wrote. &#8220;I also wrote about wealthy people not paying their fair share of taxes.

Save the church, Black families have often lacked designated spaces &#8212; public, and wholly their own &#8212; where they can be immersed in community. Much like services on Sundays, reunions are rituals that give families an occasion to come together and share political wisdom and oral histories.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But many of these gatherings have been upended this year, even as an enormously consequential election unfolds and as large numbers of Americans have been shaken awake to confront a fuller picture of bigotry in their country.

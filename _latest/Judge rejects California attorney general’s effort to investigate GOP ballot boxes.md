<p>Republican leaders have sparred with Becerra and Padilla, both Democrats, for the past two weeks over <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-13/california-gop-defends-unofficial-ballot-boxes" target="_blank">the GOP program that relies on California&#8217;s </a><a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-13/california-gop-defends-unofficial-ballot-boxes" target="_blank">ballot collection law</a>, which states that a voter may &#8220;designate a person&#8221; to return their completed ballot to an elections office. The 2016 law does not limit the number of  ballots a person can gather from voters &#8212; a longtime point of contention for Republicans, who have sued Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials over a practice they deride  as &#8220;ballot harvesting.&#8221; </p><p>But this year, Republican Party leaders chose to embrace the collection process by using their own ballot drop boxes, which were deployed without any notification to elections officials. Earlier this month, social media postings showed some of the containers with signs wrongly marking them   &#8220;authorized&#8221; or &#8220;official.&#8221;</p><p>Becerra&#8217;s court filing  alleged the GOP effort &#8220;caused confusion among voters, prompted complaints from county elections officials alarmed about their use, and raised serious concerns about whether the appropriate chain of custody was being observed for ballots deposited&#8221; in the boxes.</p><p>State and local Republican officials blamed the signs on  &#8220;overzealous&#8221; volunteers and said they were quickly taken off the drop boxes, arguing that, without the erroneous signs, there is nothing about their effort to cause concern.  They have  accused Becerra and Padilla of failing to scrutinize the ballot collection activities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning groups, many of which began conducting those efforts in 2018.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

Boxes were also placed at party headquarters locations. Last week, the pastor of Freedom&#8217;s Way Baptist Church in Castaic told L.A.

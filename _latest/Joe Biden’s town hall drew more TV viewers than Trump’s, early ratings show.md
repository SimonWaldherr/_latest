Joe Biden’s town hall drew more TV viewers than President Trump’s competing event on Thursday night, according to early figures.

An average of 13.9 million viewers tuned in to ABC to watch Biden field questions from voters from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., compared to 13.1 million who watched Trump do the same on NBC, MSNBC and CNBC, initial Nielsen ratings show, according to the Wrap.

The early ratings were updated Friday afternoon, ahead of final numbers which are set to drop later on.

Biden, whose event ran from 8 to 9:30 p.m., drew an average of 12.2 million viewers including the full 9 o’clock hour, the outlet noted

The Democratic presidential candidate also came out on top with adults ages 18-49, with a 2.9 rating in the 8 to 9 p.m. slot. Trump scored a 2.1 rating, according to updated figures reported by Deadline.

These ratings do not take into account viewership on online platforms.

Trump’s town hall in Miami aired on NBC and was simulcast on NBCU cable channels MSNBC and CNBC.

He drew an average of 10.7 million total viewers from NBC, 1.7 million on MSNBC and 671,000 on CNBC, Nielsen said.

Viewers got a kick out of the so-called “nodding woman” seated in the background behind his left shoulder. She was later identified as Mayra Poli, a Dominican Republic-born fervent Trump supporter who once ran for Congress.

Biden’s event, meanwhile, was aired only on ABC.

The 90-minute town hall in Philadelphia was devoid of questions about The Post’s exposé about his son Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings.

Trump scored more eyeballs online, however, with 4.7 million views across NBC News, CNBC and CNBC television channels as of noon Friday, compared to Biden’s 2.9 million views on ABC News’ YouTube channel.

All told, Trump came out on top with the most viewers online and on TV combined — with 17.8 million views versus Biden’s 16.8 million.

The candidates held dueling town halls following the cancellation of the second presidential debate, which was to be held the same night in Miami.

Debate organizers decided the event would be remote after Trump tested positive for COVID-19.

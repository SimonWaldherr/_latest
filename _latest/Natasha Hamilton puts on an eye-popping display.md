She wowed fans with her racy ensembles on stage in the girl band, Atomic Kitten.

And Natasha Hamilton turned heads once again in her revealing ensemble on Friday when she performed an intimate gig at the Boisdale Of Belgravia restaurant.

The singer, 38, went braless while showcasing her ample assets in a plunging black dress as she belted out some tunes at the London venue.

Natasha's long-sleeved dress featured ruched detailing and a thigh-high split which only added to the show-stopping feel to the look.

The stunner paired the look with black sandal heels and bejewelled earrings.

She opted for a dewy make-up finish and styled her auburn tresses in a loose wave.

Natasha- who performed before the 10pm curfew- revealed earlier this year that she is 'certain' she contracted coronavirus after partying with her loved ones.

In March, she said that her illness began with aches, pains and sickness before developing into a dry cough, sore throat and fever.

Speaking on her Instagram story, she said: 'I was out celebrating my auntie's 50th at the weekend, that was Saturday.

'Sunday night I thought I was getting possible food poisoning. I had tummy aches, aches up my side, up my back, my neck and I was sick.

'Then the temperature kicked in, the fever, and I spent the whole night shivering and in a lot of pain.

'Yesterday I spent the whole day just in and out of sleep, and last night my fever peaked I had an awful night.'

Natasha admitted she was feeling slightly better on Wednesday, adding: 'I woke up and my fever's down, my aches are less, but now I have a sore throat, so I'm kind of getting the symptoms of the coronavirus but in a different order.

'Also people I was out with on Saturday are starting to get fevers, sore throat and dry coughs, so it is out there. We've taken the necessary precautions.'

At Wednesday’s debate with Mike Pence, Kamala Harris echoed Joe Biden’s recent claim that he doesn’t back the Green New Deal or a ban on fracking. Voters are right to doubt them; both have long supported each of those extremist plans.

Biden’s website still labels the radical GND (unveiled by Harris herself last year, as an original co-sponsor with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) “a crucial framework” for addressing climate change. The site demands “greater ambition on an epic scale” to meet the challenges. Yes, “epic.”

And Biden has repeatedly vowed to “get rid of fossil fuels.” “Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?” he was asked last year. “No,” he replied. He’d “make sure it’s eliminated.” He’s even called for industry execs to be put “in jail.”

But now the Democrats fear scaring off moderates in swing states like Pennsylvania where a lot of jobs depend on fracking and the fossil-fuels industry. So Harris-Biden now pretend they oppose Harris-AOC’s multitrillion-dollar, economy-wrecking scheme and a fracking ban.

“I don’t support the Green New Deal,” Biden claimed in his debate with President Trump. His plan, Biden insisted, is “different.”

Technically, he’s right: It’s not called the GND, and it has other small changes. But even left-leaning USA Today says his plan and the GND aren’t really “too different.”

Likewise with fracking. In a March debate, when Bernie Sanders said, “I’m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,” Biden chimed in: “So am I,” adding: “No more, no new fracking.”

Harris was also emphatic: “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” she said during the primaries. Yet Wednesday she promised, “Joe Biden will not ban fracking” — and then changed the subject.

That drew a crisp barb from her pal AOC: “Fracking is bad, actually,” the left-winger scolded on Twitter. Chill, Congresswoman. Harris and Biden are in your corner, even though they won’t admit it.

Moderates, be warned.

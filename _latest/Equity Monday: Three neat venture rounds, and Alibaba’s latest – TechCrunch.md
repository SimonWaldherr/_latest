<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest big news, chats about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>&#160;and myself&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>&#160;&#8212; and don&#8217;t forget to check out&#160;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/when-was-the-last-time-you-worked-out-your-soul/">last Friday&#8217;s episode</a>.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<ul>
<li>American equities are set to rise, which is good news for the startup-VC world as it means that the current up-cycle will continue. But the good public market is not landing evenly, as Europe sees its VC-backed IPO tally <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/19/why-tech-ipos-are-flourishing-in-the-us-and-china-but-not-europe.html">lag the rest of the world</a>.</li>
<li>The biggest recent news stories in tech and venture were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/18/alibaba-group-will-spend-3-6-billion-to-take-control-of-chinese-supermarket-giant-sun-art/">Alibaba&#8217;s enormous Sun Art deal</a> that echoes the Amazon-Whole Foods deal at first blush, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/spacex-successfully-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites-bringing-total-delivered-to-orbit-to-more-than-800/">and SpaceX&#8217;s latest success</a>. The quiet weekend could herald the return of a slower, holiday news cycle as we close in on November.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the funding front, we found three super cool startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.aifi.com/">AiFi</a> raised $14.5 million in a round <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/qualcomm-backed-aifi-to-deploy-14-5m-in-autonomous-stores/">that Crunchbase News covered</a>. Autonomous, checkout-free stores? Count us in.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lawmatics.com/">Lawmatics</a> raised a $2.5 million Seed round. The startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/lawmatics-seed-funding/">does vertical SaaS</a> (CRM, marketing) for lawyers. That just sounds lucrative.</li>
<li>And then there was <a href="https://chiper.co/">Chiper</a>, which <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chiper-raises-12-million-series-a-to-accelerate-the-digital-transformation-of-corner-store-retail-in-latin-america-301153831.html">put together</a> a $12 million round to help build out its ecommerce service in Latin America. Investors Monashees, Kaszek Ventures, and WIND Ventures put the money up.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to close we took a look at <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-capital-q3-2020/">some Q3 2020 data from CBInsights</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q3-2020-global-venture-report/">Crunchbase News</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all we got. The show is back in just a few days. Hugs!</p>

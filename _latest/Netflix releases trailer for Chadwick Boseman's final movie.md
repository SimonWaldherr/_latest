<div><p>Netflix has unveiled the trailer for the late actor Chadwick Boseman&#8217;s final movie, Oscar-tipped <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/augustwilson" class="u-underline">August Wilson</a> adaptation Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom.</p>
<p>The Black Panther star, who died in August at 43, has already been suggested as a contender for a posthumous Oscar for his performance in the film which tells the story of &#8220;Mother of the Blues&#8221; Ma Rainey, played by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/viola-davis" class="u-underline">Viola Davis</a>, and her battle for control with her white producer, while recording an album at the end of her career. Boseman plays ambitious trumpeter Levee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to compete with Chadwick&#8217;s mother, but he was my baby,&#8221; she said of the actor, having previously played his mother in James Brown biopic Get On Up. &#8220;Chadwick was an artist. That is just what he was &#8230; he loved it, he demanded it in every single way. For someone so young it was incredible to watch.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>The film is produced by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/denzelwashington" class="u-underline">Denzel Washington</a>, who previously directed and starred in Wilson&#8217;s adaptation of Fences, which saw Davis win her first Oscar.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a gentle soul and a brilliant artist, who will stay with us for eternity through his iconic performances over his short yet illustrious career,&#8221; Washington said of Boseman, whose tuition to the British American Drama Academy&#8217;s Midsummer program he had once paid.</p>
<p>Boseman died in August of colon cancer as the film was in post-production, choosing not to let others know of his illness while he was making the film.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking back at how tired he always seemed,&#8221; David said last month. &#8220;I look at his beautiful, unbelievable team that was meditating over him and massaging him, and I now realize everything they were trying to infuse in him to keep him going and working at his optimal level. And he received it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year saw Boseman star in Spike Lee&#8217;s Da 5 Bloods, a role that could also see him receive a posthumous best supporting actor nomination.</p>
<p>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom will be released in selected cinemas in November before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix" class="u-underline">Netflix</a> launch in December.</p>

<div><p>Liverpool&#8217;s hopes of retaining their Premier League title have suffered a devastating blow after it was confirmed Virgil van Dijk will undergo surgery for an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p>
<p>The talismanic defender vowed last night to return &#8220;fitter and stronger&#8221; from the setback but, given the usual rehabilitation for such injuries, the Dutchman faces a monumental battle to feature again this season.</p>
<p>&#8220;This afternoon I met with a leading consultant to start the process of planning the finer details of my rehabilitation following <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/17/everton-vs-liverpool-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">the incident yesterday</a>,&#8221; Van Dijk said in a published statement. &#8220;I&#8217;m now fully focused on my recovery and will do everything I can to be back as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the disappointment I&#8217;m a firm believer that within difficulty lies opportunity and with God&#8217;s help I&#8217;m going to make sure I return better, fitter and stronger than ever before.&#8221; Van Dijk underwent a knee scan following Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford&#8217;s challenge in the sixth minute of Saturday&#8217;s Merseyside derby.</p>
<p>Liverpool were reluctant to rule out Van Dijk returning this season, saying such a verdict cannot be made until the player has had his operation. He added: &#8220;I believe everything happens for a reason and it&#8217;s important to try and keep level-headed whether going through the highs or the lows. With the support of my wife, kids, family and everyone at Liverpool, I&#8217;m ready for the challenge ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to thank everyone for the messages of support, it&#8217;s meant a huge amount to me and my family, and I&#8217;ll now be doing everything possible to support my team-mates in any way I can ahead of a big few weeks ahead as I take my own recovery day by day. I&#8217;ll be back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Although the welfare of the centre-back &#160;- generally regarded the best defender in the world - is the club&#8217;s immediate concern, the repercussions for this year&#8217;s title race are huge.</p>

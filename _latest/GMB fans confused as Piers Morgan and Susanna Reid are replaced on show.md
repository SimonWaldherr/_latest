"Our Ranvir, she said she could keep up with giovanni... you've got the right attitude at the moment, you're just loving it."</p> <p>"The first live show is quite a big thing," Ranvir said, clearly worrying about next Saturday's show. "I was broken after that first day, totally broken!"</p> <p><strong>*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV</strong></p></div>

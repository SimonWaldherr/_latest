A jarring police photo has captured the moment a teenager re-enacted how he fatally stabbed two intruders who stormed into his house.

Dean Webber, then 19, stabbed Tom Davy, 27, and friend Corey Christensen, 37, after they allegedly ripped through his screen door and grabbed the young diesel fitter by the throat.

Lawyers for Mr Webber have said he shouldn't be called to give evidence at the inquest into the two deaths, with a doctor on Thursday due to speak to the inquiry about the PTSD the young man has suffered in the years since the tragedy.

Mr Webber had been alone in his home in Alva Beach, north Queensland, when a woman frantically knocked on his door on September 30, 2018.

Candace Locke, 31, said she had injured her shoulder and 'very bad people' were looking for her after boozy celebrations for that year's NRL Grand Final.

Mr Webber alleged three men including Mr Davy and Mr Christensen came banging on his front door about 12.30am.

Both Mr Davy and Mr Christensen were stabbed in the ensuing melee. The third man, Louis Bengoa, was unscathed.

Mr Webber's walk-through with police was played to the inquest on Wednesday, revealing a drastically different series of events to Mr Bengoa's story.

A photo of the walk-through showed a clearly emotional Mr Webber clasping his face with his hands and saying 'I just wanted it all to end', The Courier-Mail reported.

Video footage of him being interviewed at the scene showed Mr Webber crying as he relayed his actions to Ayr CIB Detective Sergeant Gavin Neal.

He said three men entered the property.

'When the first male individual got the door and lifted it up over the latch I remember [someone saying] "I've got you f***ing now" and just pummeled me,' Mr Webber alleged in the video shown at inquest.

'I've never been so scared in my life.'

Mr Webber claimed the intruders broke the door to enter his home, 9News reported.

'When they first grabbed me, that's when I did it. I just reflexed, you know. I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted it all to end,' Mr Webber said.

'They must have pulled it up diagonally or something and it's come off the locking mechanism,' he said.

'They would have been like, 'bingo f*****g got you'.'

But Mr Webber's version of events differ drastically to those presented by Mr Bengoa.

Mr Bengoa said he arrived at Mr Webber's home with Mr Christensen and Mr Davy after Ms Locke 'ran off'.

He said he 'went for a pee and a smoke', while the other two men approached Mr Webber's house.

When he returned, Mr Bengoa claimed he saw Mr Davy running from the house with his shirt soaked in blood.

Mr Webber made three distressing calls to emergency services throughout the night, two before the fatal fight and one afterwards, the Townsville Bulletin reported.

'I need police right now, I've just stabbed a bloke who broke into my house,' Mr Webber told the operator at the beginning of the final call.

'They broke into my house. There's blood everywhere. I think I killed him. I was scared for my life. The other two are going to kill me.'

Mr Webber first placed a call to Queensland Ambulance Service at 12.24am.

Ms Locke could be heard sobbing in the background of the phone call, telling the operator she was pushed from a buggy and ran to the home for help.

Distress was evident in Mr Webber's voice as he revealed the men had arrived on his property and were trying to break in.

Mr Webber then placed a call to Queensland Police explaining the men were trying to break into his home and that he was housing a distressed woman he didn't know.

'You're not allowed to be here… you need to leave now… I need police right now…' Mr Webber could be heard saying.

At 12.57am, Mr Webber made his chilling final emergency call.

'I've just killed a bloke most likely. I think I stabbed him in the heart. There is a bloke dying. I can see him out on the street. He's not moving.

'I don't know how I'm still alive to be honest,' he told the operator.

Mr Webber said he 'did everything he could' to protect himself and said he was still holding the knife that he'd used to 'keep it as evidence'.

'He grabbed my arm, I had it in my left arm and I tried anything I could to protect myself because he was going to kill me,' he said.

Mr Webber placed the knife down on the table when he was asked and began sobbing uncontrollably as he turned on the kitchen lights and surveyed the scene.

'Oh my god… oh my god… there is blood everywhere… it's everywhere,' he sobbed.

'I'm too young for this.'

Mr Webber repeatedly begged for emergency services to arrive and asked the operator to stay on the phone with him.

'Am I going to go to jail for this?' he asked.

The audio ended with police arriving at the home and shouting at Mr Webber not to move before putting him in handcuffs.

Mr Webber was never charged after the Triple-Zero operator he had called prior to the attack reportedly left the line open for 50 minutes - effectively providing evidence he acted in self-defence.

On Tuesday, Mr Webber's lawyer Harvey Walters submitted an application stating he had been diagnosed with 'moderate to severe' post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the coronal investigation.

He said the man became extremely emotional when speaking about the events two years ago and advised he be excused from taking the stand.

<div><p>When it came to values and beliefs, my husband and I always sang from the same hymn sheet. We both voted Leave, we both vote Conservative, we are both agnostic, we both agreed on the fundamentals of how to raise our two children.</p>
<p>Yes, we bickered, but these shared opinions and ideas on the big things in life were the glue that held us together. They were the reason we could empathise with each other and the reason we shouted the same things on the television, because the same things annoyed us.</p>
<p>Recently, however, a schism has opened between us that I fear has put our entire marriage in jeopardy. It began in a local caf&#233; several weeks ago.</p>
<p>We walked in, with our face masks on, and I noticed a sign on the counter with a QR code link to the NHS Test and Trace app. I had not downloaded it at that point, so I took my phone out of my pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you doing that?&#8221; my husband asked. &#8220;The Government uses it to track you.&#8221; &#8220;I know,&#8221; I laughed, &#8220;that&#8217;s the point.&#8221; &#8220;But it&#8217;s all part of the plan to control us,&#8221; he continued. I shook my head, not sure if he was joking, despite the serious look on his face.</p>
<p>A few days later, when I mentioned the app again and asked if he had downloaded it, he shook his head and frowned, as if I was asking a ridiculous question. Of course he hadn&#8217;t, he told me.</p>
<p>I wanted to understand his thought process, so I questioned him. He regurgitated one of the ridiculous social media conspiracies circulating online, that the test and trace app is a nefarious piece of software that is being used to monitor and control the populace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you realise how silly that sounds?&#8221; I tried to reason with him. Over the following days, I tried hard not to focus on the issue, but it increasingly bothered me. I felt disappointed in him.</p>
<p>The following week, he tutted when I reminded him to put his mask on as we entered a shop. I was taken aback when he mumbled something about not being a sheep.</p>
<p>Then, the other day, when we were watching a news report about the race to find a vaccine, he blurted out that he wouldn&#8217;t be having it. &#8220;And neither will the children,&#8221; he stated, before explaining that the vaccine is being developed by Big Pharma in cahoots with the Government and is another control mechanism.</p>
<p>I was astounded. I know everyone is entitled to an opinion, but he was plain wrong and his beliefs were dangerous. I told him how ridiculous he sounded and that I was shocked that he would be so weak-minded as to believe such balderdash. He would not see reason.</p>
<p>Since the outburst, I&#8217;ve done my best to skirt away from any discussions that involve coronavirus. In the current climate, that is difficult. I know I am just kicking the issue down the road.</p>
<p>It has put an immense strain on our relationship because it is such a fundamental difference of opinion on such an important matter. He can have his views, but there is no way I will let him endanger my children because of some ridiculous anti-vax conspiracy.&#160;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t fathom that the man I married, and the father of my children, would even consider denying them a medicine that would allow us all to live normal lives again. On a deeper level, I am disappointed in him.</p>
<p>I always thought he was an intelligent, rational person. Someone I could rely on. That we are so far apart in our values and beliefs now makes me sad. It has created a fundamental divide in our world views that I&#8217;m not sure I can reconcile, and I pray that he will realise how silly those views are.</p>
<p>Most people recover from Covid-19, but I&#8217;m scared my marriage will not recover from Covid-19 conspiracies.</p>

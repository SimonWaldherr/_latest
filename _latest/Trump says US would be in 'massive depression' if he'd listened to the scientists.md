We do have vaccines and therapeutics coming down the pike, but when you look at the time period for that, the next six to 12 weeks are going to be the darkest of the pandemic, he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Vaccines will not become available in any meaningful way until early to [the] third quarter of next year. And even then, about half of the U.S. population at this point is skeptical of even taking the vaccine.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Osterholm blamed the skepticism on a 'major problem in messaging.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He explained that Americans don't have a 'lead' or 'consolidated' voice to guide them through the pandemic at the moment.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Friday, there were 70,000 new coronavirus cases in the country - the highest level since July.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Osterholm said that figure is worrying and perhaps a sign of things to come, despite many who argue that this is as a result of a massively increased testing capacity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Friday we had 70,000 cases, matching the largest number we had seen back during the really serious peak in July. That number... we're going to blow right through that. And between now and the holidays we will see numbers much much larger,' Osterholm said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the White House emerged as a solid front when it enacted the coronavirus task force in January, the facade slowly waned as Trump ignored health experts' guidelines and dissenting voices entered civil discourse.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump and Fauci have publicly bumped heads over various issues before, although his latest remarks about the 'super-spreader' ACB event are perhaps the starkest example to date.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, when the epidemiologist was asked by CBS whether he would recommend another full lockdown for the nation, Fauci replied: 'Things would have to get really, really bad.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'First of all, the country is fatigued with restrictions. So we want to use public health measures, not to get in the way of opening the economy, but to being a safe gateway to opening the economy.'

adviser Scott Atlas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Several health experts have dismissed herd immunity as a viable solution, including Fauci, who called it 'total nonsense,' as well as 'scientifically and ethically problematic.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fauci, in an interview on 60 Minutes, said: 'If you just let things rip and let the infection go - no masks, crowds - that quite frankly is ridiculous.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What that will do is there will be so many people in the community that you can't shelter, that you can't protect, who are going to get sick and get serious consequences.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you talk to anybody who has any experience in epidemiology and infectious diseases they'll tell you it's risky and

say it's nonsense.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Nevada Sunday, Trump kept the focus on Biden's 'corruption' and the latest in the Hunter Biden saga, referring to the 'laptop from

Trump fan</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On this three-day swing, Nevada was the only swing state that tilted toward the Democrats in 2016, with 47.9 per cent of voters in the state picking Clinton and&#160;45.5 for Trump.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Saturday he did back-to-back rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And on Monday, Trump will do another&#160;two rallies in Arizona, a state that he won in 2016, but looks ripe for the Democrats' picking.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president woke up Sunday at his Las Vegas hotel and attended church services at the International Church of Las Vegas before jetting off to Orange County, California for several hours to raise money for his campaign 16 days before the presidential election.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Democrats and Biden have far outraised the Republican National Committee and Trump in August and September.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Carson City, the president suggested the Democrats were cheating - and their fundraising was like a 'quid pro quo,' aiming the comment at Biden.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump's impeachment revolved around whether there was a 'quid pro quo' when the president held up military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country's president to announce investigations into Hunter and Joe Biden.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Upon landing in Reno, Nevada, Trump gave reporters a quick update on the on-again, off-again stimulus talks taking place back in Washington, D.C.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think Nancy Pelosi maybe is coming along we'll find out,' Trump said. 'Want to do it at a bigger number than she wants. That doesn't mean all the Republicans agree with me but I think they will in the end if she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So we'll see what happens,' Trump added.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That didn't stop Trump from attacking the House speaker at the Carson City event, making fun of her for not wanting his 'wall' but living in a gating community and eating fancy ice cream.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also suggested Pelosi's recent talk about the 25th Amendment, which came after the president was hospitalized with the coronavirus, was actually so Democrats can dispose of Biden for his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, should they win.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Biden is gone-zo,' Trump said, a reference to the 77-year-old's age. ''Can you imagine having Kamala?' he added, calling her the most liberal member of Congress.&#160;</p><img id="i-f7b68326ddd1643e" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="662" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f7b68326ddd1643e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/11/34554462-8854971-image-a-59_1603104099562.jpg" height="662" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-dfcfca92a29620cb" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="712" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-dfcfca92a29620cb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/11/34554470-8854971-image-a-62_1603104105711.jpg" height="712" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president also hit out at some Congressional Republicans, like GOP Sen. Ben Sasse, who was extremely critical of the president on a call with constituents.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have some stupid people, you know,' Trump said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Now we have this guy Sasse. He wants to make a statement. Little Ben Sasse,' Trump jabbed. 'Republicans needs to stick together better.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump ended his rally boasting, 'The best is yet to come'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we&#8217;re taking back this country. So with your help, your devotion and your drive we&#8217;re going to keep on winning, winning, winning!' he said as attendees joined in his chant.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Masks were not widespread at Trump's Nevada rally to prevent the spread of COVID-19.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Trump warned that Biden would be more heavy-handed in dealing with the virus, which continues to see new spikes.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If he comes in, Carson City will become a ghosttown,' Trump warned. 'The Christmas season will be cancelled.'&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Twitter removed 'misleading' tweet from Dr. Scott Atlas</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">&#160;By Valerie Edwards for DailyMail.com</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Twitter has removed a 'misleading' tweet from White House adviser Dr Scott Atlas who claimed that masks don't work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the tweet shared on Saturday, Atlas wrote: 'Masks work?

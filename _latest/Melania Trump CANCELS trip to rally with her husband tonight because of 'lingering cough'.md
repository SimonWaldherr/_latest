Wolkoff also recorded conversations with Melania that she played for the media during her book tour.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Melania claimed the conversations that Wolkoff played only had portions that were designed to make her look bad. In one excerpt, Melania is&#160;heard complaining 'who gives a f*** about Christmas stuff' while talking about planning the holiday decorations for the White House.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She blasted Wolkoff as someone who 'secretly recorded our phone calls, releasing portions from me that were out of context, then wrote a book of idle gossip trying to distort my character.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The essay marked the first time Melania Trump commented on the book and the tapes, which also revealed the first lady making disparaging remarks about immigrant children being separated from their parents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In response, Wolkoff said she was puzzled why Melania Trump 'hardly knew me.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I find it puzzling that the First Lady of the United States asked someone she "hardly knew" to attend her nuptials, join her for countless lunches, help plan the presidential inauguration, stay over at the White House and Mar-a-Lago, and act as her senior adviser,' she said in a statement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I wrote this book to share with the public my experience of working with Melania, our fifteen-year-friendship, and her ultimate betrayal.

  Coronavirus UK: What did graphs government presented REALLY show? 
description: > 
  Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said: 'The infections that have seeded in the younger age groups are now penetrating the older age groups as we go forwards in time.''This is most concerning because it is the penetration of the disease into the older age groups that gives the NHS significant problems.'The first heat map he presented, which covered data up until October 1, showed infection rates were growing in 16 to 30-year-olds and starting to creep into the older groups.But 'very clearly now' the infection rates have increased markedly in the older groups in the weeks from October 1 to October 15.Hospital admissions rising in all adult age groups, led by the elderlyStatistics presented by Professor Van-Tam showed that hospital admissions are now rising in all adult age groups in England, particularly in over-45s and most noticeably in over-85s.

<p>The US reported more than 70,400 new COVID-19 cases on Friday &#8212; the highest daily total since July.</p><p>Twenty-one states have set <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">single-day records</a> for new infections in the past 10 days.</p><p>Indeed, COVID-19 cases are surging for the third time in the US since the start of the pandemic &#8212; a spike experts think could <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-third-wave-coronavirus-cases-hospitalizations-surge-2020-10">become the largest</a> yet. It's happening, they say, because more people are spending time indoors as the weather gets cold, and Americans are simultaneously feeling fatigued by pandemic safety measures.</p><p>"If the rates never get that low, and basic public-health measures are not universally adopted, and then you bring people indoors to share a meal together, you're kind of putting together the perfect storm," Ingrid Katz, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-third-wave-coronavirus-cases-hospitalizations-surge-2020-10">previously told Business Insider</a>. "Unfortunately this was completely anticipated."</p>

<p>But research continues to show that some activities and types of gatherings are far riskier than others. The four color-coded charts below reveal which types of excursions are safest right now and which are most dangerous.</p><h2>Four factors that increase your risk</h2><p>Your risk of a coronavirus infection primarily has to do with how close you get to people and for how long, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767028?guestAccessKey=55c33c48-83fa-48cc-ad1f-346477159cea&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=060420">a June study</a> showed. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-risk-factors-enclosed-spaces-crowds-close-contact-2020-6">Four factors</a> raise <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-assess-your-risk-of-catching-coronavirus-2020-5">your chances</a> of catching the virus: spending time in enclosed spaces, being among crowds, circumstances in which social distancing is though, and prolonged close contact with others (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cdc+close+contact+definition&amp;oq=cdc+close&amp;aqs=chrome.2.0i433i457j69i57j0l6.3211j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">defined as</a> being within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes total during a 24-hour period starting two days before that person feels sick).</p><p>Here's how activities stack up in terms of coronavirus risk, based on those four factors:&#160;</p><p>

    </p><h2>Levels of mask-wearing and talking matter, too</h2><p>There are two issues with the CDC's 6-foot rule, however. It's based on science that's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/6-foot-distancing-rule-is-outdated-oxford-mit-new-system-2020-8">nearly 80 years old</a>, and it doesn't take into account how well ventilated&#160; a place is, meaning how easily air can circulate. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-risk-higher-tight-indoor-spaces-with-little-air-flow-2020-5">Studies show</a> that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/air-circulation-coronavirus-how-to-judge-ventilation-systems-2020-8">poorly ventilated spaces</a> could foster coronavirus transmission.</p><p>

</p><p>So many <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/6-foot-distancing-rule-is-outdated-oxford-mit-new-system-2020-8">experts caution</a> against assuming that a distance of 6 feet keeps us 100% safe all the time. Instead, they say, it's useful to consider certain aspects of an activity, like how well a space is ventilated and whether people are wearing masks. How much talking, shouting, or singing is going on also matters, since&#160;studies have shown that talking loudly and forcefully exhaling can lead a person to spew viral particles <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-most-infectious-during-debate-biden-2020-10">farther than 6 feet</a>.</p>

<p>In August, researchers from Oxford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-08/b-rsd082420.php">a color-coded system</a> that ranks coronavirus transmission risk based on ventilation, mask-wearing, and occupancy level.&#160;</p><p>

    </p><h2>How to decrease your risk&#160;</h2><p>If you decide to engage in an activity on the higher end of the risk spectrum, like working out in a gym, there are still ways to lower your risk.</p><p>Good handwashing, especially before eating or touching your face, as well as keeping a safe distance from others snd using face masks can all help.</p><p>

    </p><p>"It appears that people are wearing masks and socially distancing more frequently as infections increase, then after a while as infections drop, people let their guard down and stop taking these measures to protect themselves and others &#8212; which, of course, leads to more infections. And the potentially deadly cycle starts over again," Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/new-ihme-covid-19-forecasts-see-nearly-300000-deaths-december-1">said in a statement</a>.</p>

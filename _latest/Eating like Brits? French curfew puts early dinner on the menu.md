  Eating like Brits? French curfew puts early dinner on the menu

  An enterprising French restaurateur is allowing customers to circumvent Paris’ newly imposed coronavirus curfew by adopting a decidedly taboo custom — eating as early as the English.The premature prix fixe also includes two glasses of beer or wine — presumably to rinse away the sting of eating so early.Indeed, supping just after sundown might prove difficult in a city where restaurants normally start serving dinner at 8 p.m. — around the time their British counterparts are typically finishing their evening meal.In the past, French gourmands have mocked many British culinary customs, from eggs in the morning to devouring baked beans, according to Culture Trip.“My barmen have become delivery boys,” said restaurateur Xavier Denamur, who owns five bars and restaurants in Paris.

<div><p>They&#8217;ll have to swallow their pride along with their dinner.</p>
<p>An enterprising French restaurateur is allowing customers to circumvent <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/paris-placed-on-strict-curfew-amid-second-wave-of-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris&#8217; newly imposed coronavirus curfew</a> by adopting a decidedly taboo custom &#8212; eating as early as the English.</p>
<p>&#8220;We said to ourselves we have two options: close in the evenings and turn off the lights, or do something positive,&#8221; said Pascal Mousset, whose restaurant, Chez Fran&#231;oise, is a favorite among local lawmakers.</p>
<p>In accordance, he&#8217;s offering a lavish &#8220;After Work&#8221; special until 8 p.m., an hour before the lockdown takes effect, from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the capital and eight other cities, Reuters reported. For about $22, early-bird epicures can enjoy a sumptuous spread of foie gras, boar pat&#233; and calamari at a time when Parisian diners would normally be tucking into their starters. The premature prix fixe also includes two glasses of beer or wine &#8212; presumably to rinse away the sting of eating so early.</p>
 
<p>Indeed, supping just after sundown might prove difficult in a city where restaurants normally <a href="https://www.eater.com/2016/10/19/13307432/paris-dining-etiquette" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start serving dinner at 8 p.m.</a> &#8212; around the time their British counterparts are typically <a href="http://projectbritain.com/food/meals.htm#:~:text=Dinner%20(sometimes%20called%20Supper)%20%2D,%3A00%20p.m.%20(Evening%20meal)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finishing their evening meal.&#160;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see if we can get used to the Anglo-Saxon habit of eating out at 7:30 p.m.,&#8221; said Denis Alexandre, 53, while lunching with a friend in the 16th arrondissement. In the past, French gourmands have mocked many British culinary customs, from eggs in the morning to devouring baked beans, <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/france/articles/english-food-habits-that-the-french-dont-understand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Culture Trip.</a> Meanwhile, during a 2005 meeting in Russia, then-French President Jacques Chirac <a href="https://nypost.com/2005/07/07/world-savors-sore-losers-french-whine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infamously joked</a> that Britain&#8217;s only contribution to European agriculture was mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Fortunately, nocturnal noshers can still sup&#8217; post-curfew, provided they get takeout or delivery. In fact, many restaurants have had to adopt a to-go format to stay afloat during quarantine, which has proved jarring for their employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;My barmen have become delivery boys,&#8221; said restaurateur Xavier Denamur, who owns five bars and restaurants in Paris. &#8220;Logistically, it&#8217;s a bit of a mess.&#8221;</p>

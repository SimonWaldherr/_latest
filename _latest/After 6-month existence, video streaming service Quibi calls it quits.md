  After 6-month existence, video streaming service Quibi calls it quits 
description: > 
  Quibi, the much-hyped mobile streaming service that touted videos in short bits, lived a short life.The fledgling streaming service proved unsuccessful for one of two reasons, they say, "the idea itself wasnâ€™t strong enough to justify a standalone streaming service or because of our timing.The company is now looking to find buyers for programming and assets, Katzenberg and Whitman say in the letter.With many Americans staying at home during shutdowns, they may have seen less need for short mobile videos meant to be watched during commutes.Recently, Katzenberg sought to sell Quibi to other industry giants including NBCUniversal, and the company Quibi hired a restructuring firm to evaluate the service's options, the Journal reported.

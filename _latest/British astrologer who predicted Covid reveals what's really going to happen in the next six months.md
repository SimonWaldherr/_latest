  British astrologer who predicted Covid reveals what's really going to happen in the next six months 
description: > 
  Because Jessica, 56, is not an economist, politician or virologist, but a British astrologer who also happens to be a psychic.So while her three million or so followers took heed, many others discounted it as quackery, or a hoax.In 2017 Jessica had predicted an enormous split in the Royal Family between the Princes and claims there will be no reconciliation between the brothers.‘The last time we saw this level of chaos was the Bush versus Gore election of 2000,’ she says.‘They’re going to really love what happens with their love lives,’ she says.

<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in February, Jessica Adams transformed the way she lived her life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She halved her working hours, cancelled everything in her diary &#8212; including a huge weekend party she&#8217;d organised for a dear friend in early March &#8212; abandoned her home in <a href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-ff8a96c0-1184-11eb-8347-d732438996df">London</a> and moved to Tasmania, where she now lives alone with two dogs and a pet chicken for company.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;I knew what was coming,&#8217; she says. &#8216;I followed my own advice. I was very much on the watch. Sometimes you have to ring the alarm bells and that&#8217;s what I did.&#8217;</p><img id="i-c58269a27c48f55e" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="768" width="632" alt="Astrologer Jessica Adams, 56, (pictured) predicted coronavirus pandemic a year before it took a hold across the hold, resulting in more than a million deaths" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-c58269a27c48f55e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/22/34543422-8852847-Astrologer_Jessica_Adams_56_pictured_predicted_coronavirus_pande-a-91_1603057284025.jpg" height="768" width="632" alt="Astrologer Jessica Adams, 56, (pictured) predicted coronavirus pandemic a year before it took a hold across the hold, resulting in more than a million deaths" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Astrologer Jessica Adams, 56, (pictured) predicted coronavirus pandemic a year before it took a hold across the hold, resulting in more than a million deaths&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A year earlier, Jessica had gone public with her prediction that a virus would disrupt the world, and also flagged a key date &#8212; January 10, 2020 &#8212; which turned out to be the day the first confirmed victim of Covid-19 died in Wuhan, China.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;The year 2020 was like Edvard Munch&#8217;s painting The Scream,&#8217; she says. &#8216;It was so extreme I didn&#8217;t know whether I should record it. But it&#8217;s my job, it&#8217;s what I do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;I wanted to warn people &#8212; about their pensions, their savings, about borrowing too much money and being ready for the world being turned upside down.&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, her words didn&#8217;t get much traction. Because Jessica, 56, is not an economist, politician or virologist, but a British astrologer who also happens to be a psychic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So while her three million or so followers took heed, many others discounted it as quackery, or a hoax. Which is a shame. Because Jessica, a gentle, softly-spoken woman, has form.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the start of the year, she described an &#8216;October surprise&#8217; in the U.S. presidential election that could end up being &#8216;Trump&#8217;s downfall&#8217;, writing: &#8216;October surprise? We see this cycle when presidents, prime ministers, premiers and senators get voted out. Get sick and resign&#8230;&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again she picked a key date &#8212;October 1, 2020 &#8212; which turned out to be the very day Donald Trump received his Covid-19 diagnosis. A coincidence? Surely.</p><img id="i-9304f42fefe3bc59" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="349" width="634" alt="The psychic had begun preparing for the pandemic months before and warned people of the impending issue which would affect everyone around the world but her words gained very little traction.

Pictured, people wear masks on the tube in London earlier this month to help slow down the spread of coronavirus</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then a few years back, when she last looked at Boris Johnson&#8217;s chart, she also correctly predicted Brexit. And in 2017 she&#8217;d foreseen a huge split in the Royal Family between the Princes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;There will be no reconciliation,&#8217; between William and Harry, she tells me very firmly when I ask during our Zoom chat, and then launches into some of the many changes that are coming our way over the next year or so.&#160;</p><p class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><p class="mol-style-bold">Jessica was alone among her peers in foreseeing that 2020 would be a year blighted by the virus&#160;</p></p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Not least, men becoming &#8216;happier, more whole human beings after shedding their toxic masculinity,&#8217; the patriarchy &#8216;going up in smoke&#8217;, the United Kingdom splitting into four completely separate countries and Italy &#8216;very likely&#8217; leaving the EU next year.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But all that only after we&#8217;ve embraced the festive season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;There will be Christmas and it will be a fantastic Christmas,&#8217; she says. &#8216;Things start to change about three days before Christmas Eve &#8212; we see cycles we haven&#8217;t seen in decades &#8212; all about friendship and the group and global security. Finally, we get the Earth coming together!&#8217; Golly. Well that&#8217;s a turn up for the books.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those not in the know, astrology (never to be confused with astronomy) is the 4,000-year-old system of studying the alignment of stars and planets to predict the future. Jessica describes it as &#8216;completely non-scientific&#8217; and &#8216;a glorious one-off&#8217;.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;It doesn&#8217;t obey statistics and you can&#8217;t run it through a computer using stats. You&#8217;re looking at an ephemeris &#8212; a huge collection of data from 1900 to 2050 and searching for patterns. Astrology is just history and history repeats.&#8217;</p><img id="i-37108d2c5a6f9fe7" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="766" width="634" alt="The astrologer has been able to predict several events before they have taken place and even picked October 1, 2020, as a day of significance in January - which turned out to be the day the President of the United States, Donald Trump, (pictured) was diagnosed with Covid-19" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-37108d2c5a6f9fe7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/20/34543440-8852847-image-m-38_1603050992834.jpg" height="766" width="634" alt="The astrologer has been able to predict several events before they have taken place and even picked October 1, 2020, as a day of significance in January - which turned out to be the day the President of the United States, Donald Trump, (pictured) was diagnosed with Covid-19" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">The astrologer has been able to predict several events before they have taken place and even picked October 1, 2020, as a day of significance in January - which turned out to be the day the President of the United States, Donald Trump, (pictured) was diagnosed with Covid-19&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So right now, she explains, we&#8217;re in the middle of a cycle very similar to that of World War II &#8212; but without the war &#8212; which will come to an end in 2026.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;It&#8217;s a complete and total revolution, not a reset, it&#8217;s a replacement. Everything will change,&#8217; she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a long time, astrology was taken very seriously &#8212; in the 17th-century astrologer William Lilly predicted the 1666 Great Fire of London &#8212; before being dismissed by scientists in the early 20th-century as mumbo jumbo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is increasingly popular and, today, a third of Britons regularly read and believe their horoscopes.</p><p class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><p class="mol-style-bold">Meghan's chart shows she will either 'make a fortune for charity or take Harry to the cleaners'&#160;</p></p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Not that Jessica has ever been bothered by the doubters. &#8216;I have confidence in my data. Astrology works. It has always worked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;It&#8217;s one of the reasons we&#8217;ve thrived and survived for so long and, today, the quality is higher than ever. You can do a degree in it!&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She also insists that every astrologer worth his or her salt would have realised 2020 would be a year of shock and change &#8212; even if they had not, as she had, predicted the actual virus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then, thanks to her psychic side &#8212; her speciality is &#8216;trance mediumship&#8217; which means she goes into a light trance to communicate with spirits &#8212; Jessica has always stood out a bit from her peers.</p><img id="i-cf59a5b220948aa6" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="911" width="634" alt="In 2017 Jessica had predicted an enormous split in the Royal Family between the Princes and claims there will be no reconciliation between the brothers.

I said Hillary,&#8217; she admits. &#8216;But Trump has two different birth dates [recorded] and, to make matters worse, we also have more than one supplied birth time for him! All the astrologers had a problem with it.&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jessica&#8217;s astrological journey began aged eight, when growing up in Brixton, South London, she became glued to Catweazle the children&#8217;s TV show based on Catweazle And The Magic Zodiac by Richard Carpenter. Out of nowhere, she became obsessed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;There was no family history. I didn&#8217;t feel I&#8217;d been &#8216;chosen&#8217;. It just happened,&#8217; she says simply.</p><img id="i-216e347ca4715f99" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="505" width="631" alt="As well as the continued disconnect between the princes, Jessica (pictured) predicts that men will become &#191;happier, more whole human beings after shedding their toxic masculinity'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-216e347ca4715f99" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/18/22/34543428-8852847-As_well_as_the_continued_disconnect_between_the_princes_Jessica_-a-92_1603057290898.jpg" height="505" width="631" alt="As well as the continued disconnect between the princes, Jessica (pictured) predicts that men will become &#191;happier, more whole human beings after shedding their toxic masculinity'" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">As well as the continued disconnect between the princes, Jessica (pictured) predicts that men will become &#8216;happier, more whole human beings after shedding their toxic masculinity'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She spent her book tokens on astrology books, read everything else she could and gave her friends readings about their love lives during school breaks. &#8216;I was good at it, I always have been.&#8217;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, for years, she put it to one side, gained two degrees, wrote a series of best-selling novels, before really embracing it again in her 30s, when she trained at the College of Psychic Studies in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ever since, Jessica has been flitting between London and Melbourne, Australia, where she has a second home, and has been busy making waves in the astrological world.</p><p class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><p class="mol-style-bold">In 2017, she turned down a female member of the Royal Family, who asked for a private reading&#160;</p></p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">She has one of the most-visited astrological websites, has written countless books including 2020 Astrology: Your Five Year Personal Horoscope Guide, and her millions of followers &#8212; including celebrities &#8212; lap up her predictions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;Some people want me to tell them what to do, but I won&#8217;t do that.

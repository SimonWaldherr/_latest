  Ex-GOP Senator Breaks Vow Of Silence, Condemns Trump’s Attacks On Debate Commission 
description: > 
  A former Republican senator who sits on the Commission on Presidential Debates has hit back at President Donald Trump and his supporters’ attacks on the integrity of the nonpartisan organization, warning of the “incalculable” damage they pose to the country.The president refused to take part in the second debate, a town hall event, after the commission changed it to a virtual format following Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis.Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden during the first debate, causing the commission to announce this week that Thursday’s third and final debate will have new rules to mute microphones.“It is not the honor of the commission that is at stake here,” he concluded.“What is at stake is Americans’ belief in the fairness of our presidential debates and, in turn, the presidential election.

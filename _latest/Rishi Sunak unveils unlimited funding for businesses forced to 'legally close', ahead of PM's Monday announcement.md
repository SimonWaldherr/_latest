Rishi Sunak has warned that some businesses will be "legally shut" again as he set out his new support for jobs ahead of Boris Johnson's next address to the country on Monday.

The Chancellor confirmed this afternoon that businesses forced to close under the new traffic light system will have two thirds of their workers’ wages paid for by the Government.

In a significant expansion of the job support scheme, employees will no longer have to work part-time in order to qualify for the wage subsidy, which one Treasury source estimated as costing "hundreds of millions a month".

Amid criticism from Labour that the Government was "flip-flopping" by extending the furlough scheme - something that had been repeatedly ruled out - Mr Sunak insisted his new package was a "very different scheme to what we had before".

The key difference was that the support was "for businesses which are formally or legally asked to close" - a sign of what is likely to be announced by the Prime Minister early next week.

The Chancellor said: "This is not a universal approach, this is an expansion of the Jobs Support Scheme specifically for those people who are in businesses that will be formally or legally asked to close so in that sense it's very different.

"I've always said that we will adapt and evolve our response as the situation on the health side adapts and evolves. That's what's happening. I think that's the pragmatic and right thing to do."

  Army needs new tanks to replace 'mobile coffins', say MPs 
description: > 
  Army vehicles are "obsolete and sub-standard... mobile coffins”, MPs told defence chiefs as they grilled the Ministry of Defence about the troubled introduction of new armoured fighting vehicles.The Defence select committee also heard that despite the shortcomings with the existing fleet, contracts worth billions for upgraded tanks, along with modernised or new armoured vehicles, were not guaranteed.Jeremy Quin, the minister for defence procurement, said no decision had been made on a potential £500m deal by BAE Systems to put a new gun and computerised combat systems on the Army's 227 Challenger II tanks.An upgrade by US defence giant Lockheed Martin to many of the 600 Warrior infantry fighting vehicles, which is running a year late and has so far cost £1.3bn, is in a similar position.

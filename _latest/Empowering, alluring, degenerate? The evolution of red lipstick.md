The cosmetics brand founder, who had just opened her business two years earlier, was a supporter of women's rights, and she aligned herself with the cause by handing out tubes of bright red lipstick to the marching women. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Charlotte Perkins Gilman loved red lipstick for its ability to shock men, and protesters donned the bold color en masse, adopting it as a sign of rebellion and liberation. </p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200302122544-red-lipstick-suffragettes-1.jpg" alt="Suffragettes from Massachusetts marching in the streets of New York City (circa 1915)"><p class="BasicArticle__caption">Suffragettes from Massachusetts marching in the streets of New York City (circa 1915)  <p class="BasicArticle__credit">Credit: </p><p class="BasicArticle__credit">FPG/Archive Photos/Getty Images</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"There could not be a more perfect symbol of suffragettes than red lipstick, because it's not just powerful, it's female," said Rachel Felder, author of last year's "Red Lipstick: An Ode to a Beauty Icon," in a phone interview. "Suffragettes were about female strength, not just strength."</p><p id="ad_rect_atf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Throughout the centuries red lipstick has signaled many things, from its early use by the elite in ancient Egypt and by prostitutes in ancient Greece, to its status in early Hollywood as a symbol of glamor. In its many hues, this color on lips has been a mighty cultural weapon, charged with thousands of centuries of meaning. "Red lipstick is truly a way to trace cultural history and societal zeitgeist," Felder said. </p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200302134152-red-lipstick-suffragettes-16.jpg" alt="Portrait of beautician and cosmetics entrepreneur Elizabeth Arden (1947)"><p class="BasicArticle__caption">Portrait of beautician and cosmetics entrepreneur Elizabeth Arden (1947)  <p class="BasicArticle__credit">Credit: </p><p class="BasicArticle__credit">Hulton Archive/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Until lipstick was popularized in the early 20th century, red lips were often associated with morally dubious women: impolite, sexually amoral, even heretical. In the Dark Ages, red lips were seen as a sign of commingling with the devil. The makeup "was associated with this mysterious, frightening femininity," Felder said.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Then, Felder's book explains, as the American suffrage movement adopted red lips, their international counterparts did, too. </p><p id="ad_nat_btf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">As women's rights movements spread across Europe, New Zealand and Australia, with British and American organizers often sharing tactics, from organizing marches, to hunger strikes, to more aggressive militant strategies. And this solidarity extended to their makeup. Inspired by her American counterparts, British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst favored a red lip, which helped spread the symbolic gesture among her fellow activists. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Though suffragettes popularized the red-lip look in their day, Felder notes that there was already momentum to normalize lipstick among women more generally, as they dropped restrictive corsets for brassieres, and started to adopt more streamlined silhouettes, designed by the likes of Coco Chanel. </p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200302125154-red-lipstick-suffragettes-8.jpg" alt="ATS anti-aircraft spotter near London (1943)"><p class="BasicArticle__caption">ATS anti-aircraft spotter near London (1943)  <p class="BasicArticle__credit">Credit: </p><p class="BasicArticle__credit">Reg Speller/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p></p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200302131927-red-lipstick-suffragettes-10.jpg" alt="Four female cipher and switchboard operators (1945)"><p class="BasicArticle__caption">Four female cipher and switchboard operators (1945)  <p class="BasicArticle__credit">Credit: </p><p class="BasicArticle__credit">J. Wilds/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">After the suffragettes wore red lipstick, the exuberant flappers of the Roaring Twenties followed suit. And while suffragettes may not have been solely responsible for popularizing a painted lip, they embodied the idea of the "modern woman" in Europe and America, Felder pointed out. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">During World War II, red lips had their bold second act of defiance. Adolf Hitler "famously hated red lipstick," Felder said. In Allied countries, wearing it became a sign of patriotism and a statement against facism. When taxes made lipstick prohibitively expensive in the UK, women stained their lips with beet juice instead. </p><p id="ad_rect_btf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">As men went off to war and women filled their professional roles back home, they donned red lips to enter the workforce. It showed their resilience in the face of conflict, Felder explained, and offered a sense of normalcy in difficult times. "It allowed women to retain a sense of their own self-identity from before the war." J. Howard Miller's illustration of Rosie the Riveter, the cultural icon who was used to recruit and empower American female factory workers, notably had cherry-daubed lips.</p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200302132940-red-lipstick-suffragettes-12.jpg" alt="'Rosie the Riveter' by J.

Beauty brands had capitalized on the wartime trend, with Elizabeth Arden releasing "Victory Red" and Helena Rubenstein introducing "Regimental Red," among others. But it was Arden who the American government asked to create a regulation lip and nail color for serving women. Her "Montezuma Red" matched and accentuated their uniforms' red piping.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"Wearing red lipstick for a woman in that era was so linked to... a sense of feminine self-esteem," particularly, "resilient and strong female self-esteem," said Felder, who has herself worn the beauty staple nearly every day since high school. After the war, classic Hollywood actresses like Elizabeth Taylor added a layer of glamour to the confident look.</p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200302134446-red-lipstick-suffragettes-17.jpg" alt="Beauty expert Helena Rubinstein illustrating how make-up can be applied to flatter individual contours (c. 1935)"><p class="BasicArticle__caption">Beauty expert Helena Rubinstein illustrating how make-up can be applied to flatter individual contours (c. 1935)  <p class="BasicArticle__credit">Credit: </p><p class="BasicArticle__credit">Orlando/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Today, other protest symbols for women's empowerment have become widespread, notably the pink pussy hat that dominated the 2017 Women's March; and the habit from "The Handmaid's Tale" which has been worn internationally for women's causes, including pro-choice demonstrations. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Yet red lips still pack a punch.

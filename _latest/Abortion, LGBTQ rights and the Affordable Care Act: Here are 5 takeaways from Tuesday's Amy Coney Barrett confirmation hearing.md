WASHINGTON — Tuesday's Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Amy Coney Barrett was largely calm and predictable.

Republicans applauded her conservatism, Democrats pressed her on sensitive issues, and the nominee largely sidestepped such questions.

Barrett, who would replace the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, did not give definitive answers regarding same-sex marriage, abortion, election security, and other questions while being pressed during the 11-hour hearing.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee will have another chance to question Barrett on her views on the law, and a number of other hot-button issues that could come before the court, again on Wednesday.

Here are some key takeaways and top moments from Tuesday's hearing:

'I don't have any agenda' on abortion

It didn’t take long for Barrett to be questioned about abortion. And it didn’t take long for her to sidestep the question.

Barrett explained it would be wrong for her to express her view on Roe v. Wade or a later abortion case decided by the Supreme Court because a similar case could come before the high court.

“It would actually be wrong and a violation of the canons for me to do that,” Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “It signals to litigants that I might tilt one way or another on a pending case.”

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the panel, called Barrett’s answer “distressing.”

Barrett acknowledged she understood why the question was asked.

But the nominee told the panel, “I don’t have any agenda” to try to overrule Roe or its successor, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, both of which were decided in the 20th century. What she promised to do is to “follow the rules of stare decisis,” or Supreme Court precedent.

Barrett was also pressed about abortion ads she originally failed to disclose. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked about her views on abortion because of a 2006 letter she had signed running alongside an ad calling for “an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.”

Barrett, who signed the ad while serving as a University of Notre Dame law professor, told Hawley she had signed the ad on her way out of church, and added that she signed it when she was still a private citizen, and "now I'm a public official."

As a public official, she said, it would not be “appropriate” to express an “affirmative view” on the issue.

Asked by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., about the 2006 ad and a 2013 ad sponsored by the Notre Dame University Faculty for Life, Barrett told him she did not disclose them because she did not remember the ads.

White House independence?

Barrett fought back against caricatures that she is a committed advocate for conservative causes chosen by President Donald Trump to do his bidding on issues, such as abortion to the Affordable Care Act.

"I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide the election for the American people," Barrett said.

She continued, “I have made no commitment to anyone, not in the Senate, not over at the White House, about how I would decide any case,” she said.

When she was pressed whether she asked before being nominated if she would overturn the ACA?

“Absolutely not,” she said. “I was never asked, and if I had been, that would have been a short conversation.”

While her mentor, the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, famously had opinions on everything and expressed them freely, “If I’m confirmed you would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett."

Questions about recusal

Democrats urged Barrett to pledge that, if confirmed, she would recuse herself both from cases involving the election and from the challenge to the Affordable Care Act.

Asked if she would recuse herself from the ACA case if she’s confirmed by the time the Supreme Court takes up the issue, she said it’s “a legal issue” that she would discuss with her colleagues, not “a question that I could answer in the abstract.”

Senate Judiciary Democrats also seized on comments that Trump wants a Supreme Court justice seated quickly in case there’s a dispute over ballots or other procedures from the Nov. 3 election.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., pressed Barrett on whether she should recuse herself if a case arises that could decide the presidency, since it would involve the person who nominated her just weeks before.

She declined to speak specifically about a recusal from any election case, saying she would follow court procedure and consult with the other members of the court before deciding whether to participate in the ruling.

'Sexual preference' and LGBTQ rights

Barrett faced criticism regarding language she used when discussing LGBTQ rights.

She was asked whether she agrees with Scalia’s criticism of the same-sex marriage ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges – the landmark case which legalized gay marriage in the United States and which advocates worry Barrett would not support if confirmed to the nation's highest court.

Barrett's answer? “I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would never discriminate on the basis of sexual preference.”

That response drew considerable blowback on social media from LGBTQ advocates who say “sexual preference” implies that sexuality is a choice. The more precise, and accepted, term is “sexual orientation.”

Pete Buttigieg, the former Democratic presidential candidate and openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, seemingly jabbed at Barrett’s wording, tweeting, “My *preference* is that the winner of this presidential election should choose the next justice.”

The National Women’s Law Center also weighed in: “It's not a 'preference,' Judge Barrett.”

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, later slammed Barrett, saying the judge used an "offensive and outdated term."

"I don't think it was an accident" she used the phrase, Hirono said, citing Scalia's dissent in Obergefell.

Barrett apologized after Hirono spoke, saying, "I certainly didn't mean, and would never mean, to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community. So if I did, I greatly apologize for that."

On the peaceful transfer of power

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., pressed Barrett on whether presidents should commit to a peaceful transfer of power, another Trump-related controversy. She originally declined to answer the question, citing current “political controversy” she wanted to stay out of as a judge.

Trump has repeatedly declined to commit to providing a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the Nov. 3 election.

As Booker pressed, Barrett touted the United States' nonviolent practice of electing its leaders by saying, "One of the beauties of America, from the beginning of the republic, is that we have had peaceful transfers of power, and that disappointed voters have accepted the new leaders that come into office."

"That's not true in every country, and I think it is part of the genius of our Constitution, and the good faith and goodwill of the American people, that we haven't had the situations that have arisen in so many other countries where those issues have been present," she continued.

Barrett also would not comment on whether a president can pardon themselves for crimes.

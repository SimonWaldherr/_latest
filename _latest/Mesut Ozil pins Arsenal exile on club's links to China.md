  Mesut Ozil pins Arsenal exile on club's links to China 
description: > 
  Mesut Ozil is convinced Arsenal's commercial interests in China influenced the club's decision to omit him from their Premier League and Europa League squads.Arsenal retain a significant commercial presence in China, where the club own a restaurant chain and have an official lottery partner and vehicle provider, which has strengthened Ozil's conviction that he has been singled out.Ozil appeared at pains to avoid criticising coach Mikel Arteta, but was scathing towards the club.'I will continue to train as best as I can and wherever possible use my voice against inhumanity and for justice,' he added.Arteta said: 'What I can say from my side is that it is a football decision.

Between 1979 and 1987, Kretzmer was the Mail’s television critic (he was named Critic of the Year in 1980). In 1984 he tried to persuade the West End producer Cameron Mackintosh to back a sharper, angrier version of a 1964 musical he had written, Our Man Crichton.

Mackintosh declined. But as Kretzmer was crossing the vast expanse of carpet to leave, he inquired: “Why didn’t you go on writing lyrics?” Kretzmer listed a number of songs he had written, including She and Yesterday When I Was Young for the French crooner Charles Aznavour. These, it turned out, were among Mackintosh’s favourites.

“Six months later,” Kretzmer recalled, “when he was stuck for a lyricist for Les Misérables, Mackintosh remembered that snatch of conversation between the sofa to the door. In those 15 yards, my life totally changed.” The show’s original English language lyricist, the poet James Fenton, had struggled with the project, turning in words which (as the musical historian Mark Steyn noted) “looked great on paper but were mostly unsingable”. Mackintosh gave Kretzmer five months to come up with something that worked.

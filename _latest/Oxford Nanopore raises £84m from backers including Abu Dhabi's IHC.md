British biotech company Oxford Nanopore has received fresh backing from Abu Dhabi's International Holdings as it accelerates its coronavirus testing work.

The Oxford University spin-out raised £84m of new capital from existing and new investors including IHC and railway penion manager RPMI Railpen, taking the total it has raised this year to £162m.

IP Group, one of its early backers, said the funds would support the "rapid acceleration" of Oxford Nanopore's commercial and manufacturing operations.

The company recently developed a new type of test for Covid-19 which could process tens of thousands of results a day and allow entire groups of people to be tested for the virus. These LamPORE tests were touted as a way to help pick up asymptomatic cases, as organisations such as police forces or schools could be tested regularly.

A study last week by scientists at University College London showed that more than eight in ten people who tested positive for coronavirus showed none of the main symptoms at the time they took the test, something scientists warned could mean many people infected were not self-isolating.

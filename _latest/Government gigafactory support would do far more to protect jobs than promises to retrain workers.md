There is a lot to play for. In fact, many believe the very survival of the UK car industry is at stake.

To be clear, the UK has plenty going for it, including a domestic supply of lithium in Cornwall, an established car industry with a highly skilled labour force.

Vale’s Clydach nickel refinery near Swansea in Wales, which has been operating since 1902, is one of Europe’s biggest manufacturers of some of the essential raw materials.

Moreover, the UK has deep and longstanding expertise in the science of developing advanced batteries.

The technology behind the lithium-ion battery on which electric cars, smartphones and so many other modern devices now rely was developed at Oxford University in the 1970s.

A clear plan also exists to build the type of facility needed to produce batteries for the UK car industry.

Britishvolt, a £1.2bn project to build a gigafactory nearly twice as big as Northvolt’s plant at Skelleftea, is moving forwards – but it remains three years behind and faces some critical challenges.

Above all the project urgently needs more government support and clarity over state aid rules if it wants to avoid missing the boat.

Sweden’s Northvolt has been earmarked an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) – an EU scheme which allows it to bypass European state aid rules to receive lashings of government support.

That includes a €443m (£402m) loan guarantee from the government of Germany and a €350m (£318m) loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).

Since the UK is not a member of the seven nation IPCEI scheme and is in any case leaving the EU, right now, Britishvolt cannot hope to qualify for similar levels of support, without which it will be tough for it to compete.

In fact, under existing rules, Britishvolt would only be allowed to secure less than £40m in equivalent government support.

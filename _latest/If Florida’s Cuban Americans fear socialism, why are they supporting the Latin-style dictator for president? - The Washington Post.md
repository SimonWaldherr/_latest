  If Florida’s Cuban Americans fear socialism, why are they supporting the Latin-style dictator for president? - The Washington Post 
description: > 
  Even more astonishing is the fact that, for a people steeped in Fidel Castro and his legacy, so few Cuban Americans can actually see which candidate in the race resembles a Latin American dictator: President Trump.My sister, Mariana, is among the nearly 60 percent of Cuban American registered voters who, according to a new poll, intend to vote for Trump.He’s a 70-year-old Cuban armchair historian who supports Biden, and when I called to ask him about the Trump-as-anti-socialist-savior phenomenon, he laughed.He has done almost nothing to help oust Nicolás Maduro, the socialist president of Venezuela.Memories of dictatorships — particularly socialist ones — influence their voting, and in Florida, as we know well, every single vote counts.

<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">But nothing in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/us/politics/joe-biden-college-1960s.html">Biden&#8217;s past</a> even hints of a covert fascination with communism or socialism &#8212; unless you confuse expanding affordable health care and raising taxes for<b> </b>Marxism. As far as I can tell, no Democrat is looking to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/12/08/the-20-largest-u-s-property-claims-in-cuba/?itid=lk_inline_manual_6" target="_blank">nationalize Coca-Cola</a>.

My sister, Mariana, is among the nearly 60 percent of Cuban American registered voters who, according to a <a href="https://cri.fiu.edu/research/cuba-poll/2020-fiu-cuba-poll.pdf">new poll</a>, intend to vote for Trump. She worries that a Biden presidency will drag the country down the socialist path: Because &#8220;Biden is an old man with dementia,&#8221; she fears, he&#8217;ll quickly hand over power to a cadre of Reds led by Kamala D. Harris, Nancy Pelosi and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-florida.html">compa&#241;ero Bernie Sanders</a>.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">As far as clarion calls to get out the vote go, this is a hard one to beat. Like my sister, Nelson Diaz, the chairman of the <a href="https://www.miamidadegop.org/party-leadership" target="_blank">Republican Party of Miami-Dade Count</a><a href="https://www.miamidadegop.org/party-leadership" target="_blank">y</a>, is ringing the warning alarms. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying if in 2020 Biden wins we will have a communist dictatorship,&#8221; Diaz cautions. &#8220;But we will drift ever closer to socialism, and that tipping point will come quickly.&#8221; Biden&#8217;s socialist coup will begin, he explains, with the Internal Revenue Service: &#8220;They would take our businesses through an ever-increasing number of taxes.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The only thing standing between us and this Orwellian nightmare, many Cuban Americans argue, is the president&#8217;s reelection. They view him as<b> </b>a patriotic family man who fights communist-style government corruption and speaks the truth. His Miami supporters bristle at any suggestion that he&#8217;s an authoritarian wrapped in an American flag, arguing that Trump is just doing what&#8217;s necessary to Make America Great Again.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">On the other side of my family&#8217;s political spectrum, my brother Frank doesn&#8217;t have a lot of use for this confusing <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=arroz%20con%20mango"><i>arroz con mango</i></a> stance, as they say in Miami. He&#8217;s a 70-year-old Cuban armchair historian who supports Biden, and when I called to ask him about the Trump-as-anti-socialist-savior phenomenon, he laughed.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;You know, I keep a checklist.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Chuckling, I took the bait. &#8220;What?&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">He pulled up his &#8220;Dictator Checklist&#8221; on his desktop and started reading.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">1.

Rather than hold an <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article246382830.html">&#8220;Anti-Communist Caravan for Freedom and Democracy</a>,&#8221; as some Cubans and Venezuelans did in Miami recently, they should zero in on Trump&#8217;s dangerous erosion of democratic institutions designed to check and balance power.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump is head-butting American democracy in a way few believed possible. He has done almost nothing to help oust Nicol&#225;s Maduro, the socialist president of Venezuela. He has cozied up to Russia&#8217;s Vladimir Putin, a career KGB officer, and Kim Jong Un, the communist dictator of North Korea. He did crack down on American visits to Cuba with the usual predictable result: no change on the island. (Trump also<b> </b>hedged his bets in 2008 when he applied to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article245902870.html">register his trademark</a> in Cuba).</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">It is Trump&#8217;s authoritarianism at home and his affection for authoritarians abroad &#8212; not a Biden-led socialist takeover &#8212; that poses the existential threat to America&#8217;s prosperity and freedom. &#8220;A lot of Cubans have been here a hell of a long time, and we should know better than to think there is a socialist specter around every corner,&#8221; says Guillermo Grenier, chair of the department of global and sociocultural studies at Florida International University. </p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Still, Biden and his campaign shouldn&#8217;t<b> </b>be dismissive or complacent. The socialist red herring resonates beyond Miami, but it carries unique weight here. Cubans, Nicaraguans, Argentines and, most recently, Venezuelans have seen left-wing and right-wing strongmen up close. Memories of dictatorships &#8212; particularly socialist ones &#8212; influence their voting, and in Florida, as we know well, every single vote counts.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The Biden team can start by reminding Cuban exiles and their descendants of why they&#8217;re here: to preserve liberty and democracy, not undermine it.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><b>Read more:</b></p></div>

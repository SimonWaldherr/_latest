<p>Working from home looks set to stay, but for the vast majority of office workers it's a major culture shock.</p><p>Remote working can limit your productivity for many reasons, including dealing with new pressures or missing face-to-face contact with colleagues, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2020/03/30/why-working-from-home-is-so-exhausting-and-how-to-reinvigorate/#4bd2389c55ab">the Ph.D. psychologist Tracy Brower wrote in a piece for Forbes</a>. </p><p>Kirsten Allegri Williams is a <a href="https://kirstenallegri.com/critical-acclaim/">critically acclaimed mezzo-soprano opera singer</a>, and has always had to manage her working days between singing, her career in tech and business-to-business, and her family.&#160;</p><p>In June, Williams left one of the world's biggest software companies, SAP, where she worked for over 20 years as a senior marketer. She is now at commerce provider Episerver as its chief marketing officer. She has recently overseen the acquisition of the Silicon Valley software startup, Optimizely. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/insight-venture-partners-buys-content-management-platform-episerver-for-1-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p><p>We asked her to share her tips on boosting productivity while remote, and on a busy schedule:</p><h3><strong>Connect with people beyond your immediate team<br></strong></h3><p>Virtual tools, such as Zoom and Google Meet, have made the transition to remote work easier &#8212; even if some of us are experiencing the dreaded Zoom burnout.</p><p>Many professionals are struggling to connect with people beyond their immediate colleagues and team members because of back-to-back internal meetings.</p><p>Try to prioritize virtual conversations with industry peers and take time to speak to customers, Williams said.</p>

<p>"These conversations foster creativity, new ideas, and help me be inspired by what others are doing in their field," she said.</p><h3><strong>Practice empathy, push for open communication</strong></h3><p>If you struggle with productivity, someone else might too.</p><p>Ask for advice and support your friends, family, and colleagues &#8212; "with innate empathy," she said. And don't forget that "everyone's situation is unique" &#8212; someone may need to organize their day to care for their families or themselves, Williams said.</p><h3><strong>Mix downtime with learning</strong></h3><p>If you feel like you don't have enough time to educate yourself on the changes your industry is going through during working hours, consider whether you have to energy to use some spare time to read about your industry, understand the latest trends, technology, and talent in your sector, Williams said.</p><p>"So often we're so focused on what is right in front of us versus taking the opportunity to learn," she said.</p><p>Williams often finds that time after work and while her kids are playing or watching TV to be a time when creativity sparks. "It's a relaxing time &#8230; when I'm not thinking about what I need to get done but only about the options of what could be done," she said.</p><h3><strong>Walking meetings</strong></h3><p>Many calls need to be on a screen, but some can be done on smartphones while walking outside, getting some exercise, and fresh air.&#160;</p><p>Walking meetings <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-slack-kill-productivity-home-working-advice-apple-google-adviser-2020-9">help to clear distractions</a> and focus on the conversation. "This works particularly well for 1:1 calls with your direct reports," she said.</p>

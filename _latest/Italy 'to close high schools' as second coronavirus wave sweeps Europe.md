Italy is considering a nationwide curfew and closing high schools after the country reported its highest every daily toll of coronavirus infections as the second wave of the pandemic swept Europe.

New measures were introduced or are expected against the resurgent virus in other European countries as records for infection numbers were broken across the Continent on Saturday.

Italian authorities meet this evening to discuss the measures, which would close cafes and restaurants from 10pm and compel people to return home. More than 10,000 coronavirus infections were reported in Italy on Friday.

Cinemas could be closed and football matches, both professional and amateur, are expected to be banned. Only emergency or essential travel will be allowed, under the new rules, according to media reports in Italy.

The national measures, which include a push to increase working from home, will form a baseline on which regional governments can build, especially if they are in high contagion areas.

Lombardy, Italy's most populous region, has once again become the most affected in the Covid-19 resurgence, adding more than 2,000 infections a day. Hospitals intensive care units are coming under strain.

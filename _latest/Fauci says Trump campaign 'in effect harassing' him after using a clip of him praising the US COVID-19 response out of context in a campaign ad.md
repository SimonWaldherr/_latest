The top US infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, slammed the Trump campaign for using his words out of context and without his consent in a recent political ad.

"By doing this against my will, they are in effect harassing me," Fauci told The Daily Beast on Monday.

Fauci told CNN over the weekend that his words, from a press conference in March, were taken out of context.

The campaign ad made it seem as if Fauci's comment that "I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more" was referring to President Donald Trump, but it was instead referring to the White House coronavirus task force, of which Fauci is a member.

The top US infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has accused the Trump campaign of "in effect harassing" him after it ran an out-of-context clip of him praising the US coronavirus response.

In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday, Fauci condemned the move, saying it would be "outrageous" and "terrible" if the Trump campaign were to do it again with another ad.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared in the campaign ad in a way that suggested he was praising President Donald Trump.

"I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more," Fauci said in the ad.

He made that comment, however, about the White House coronavirus task force — of which he is a member — and not specifically Trump.

The infectious-disease expert told CNN over the weekend that his words, from a press conference in March, were taken out of context and without his consent.

"In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate," Fauci told CNN. "The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public-health officials."

While Fauci slammed the move, he told The Daily Beast on Monday that there was "not a chance" that he would resign from the task force in the event that the Trump campaign ran another ad with him in it.

"Not in my wildest freakin' dreams did I ever think about quitting," Fauci said.

Fauci told The Daily Beast that the tactic of using his comments in political ads could "come back to backfire" against the campaign.

"By doing this against my will, they are in effect harassing me," he said. "Since campaign ads are about getting votes, their harassment of me might have the opposite effect of turning some voters off."

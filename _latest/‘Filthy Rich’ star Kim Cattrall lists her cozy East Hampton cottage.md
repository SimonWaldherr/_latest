<div><p>&#8220;Sex and the City&#8221; alum Kim Cattrall has put her East Hampton escape <a href="https://www.sothebyshomes.com/hamptons/sales/0049034-105-Gerard-Drive-East-Hampton-NY-11937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the market for $3.25 million</a>. The actress bought the charming cottage (in the Springs on Gardiners Bay) for $450,000 back in 1998, when &#8220;SATC&#8221; first hit HBO.</p>
<p>The gated property, at 105 Gerard Drive, is a cozy 1,232 square feet with two bedrooms and one-and-a-half bathrooms spread over a quarter of an acre. There&#8217;s also a custom kitchen, a screening room, plenty of pop art of Cattrall on the walls and a back porch (where she married her now ex-husband, Mark Levinson).</p>
<p>Other highlights include a studio, a hot tub, an outdoor kitchen and a waterside firepit. &#8220;I will miss my daily walks down Gerard Drive and that gorgeous ocean view sitting by the firepit,&#8221; Cattrall tells Gimme.</p>
<p>The star was a fixture on the Hamptons party scene for decades but is now based on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, where she lives with her partner, Russell Thomas. One part of the Hamptons Cattrall isn&#8217;t likely to miss, friends say, is <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/09/06/kim-cattrall-dines-at-lavenue-after-satc-feud-resurfaces/?_ga=2.177421477.1053318317.1603225867-2001606394.1601146450" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her two-decade feud with co-star</a> and East End staple Sarah Jessica Parker.</p>

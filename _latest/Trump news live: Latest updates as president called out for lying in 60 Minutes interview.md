  Trump news live: Latest updates as president called out for lying in 60 Minutes interview 
description: > 
  Donald Trump is accused of lying over the economy in the first preview clip from his aborted interview with Lesley Stahl for CBS’s 60 Minutes, an interview he angrily terminated on Tuesday and has since denounced as a “vicious takedown”, threatening to release his own edited version of the exchange.The president himself is due to take on Democratic rival Joe Biden in Nashville, Tennessee, on Thursday night, having spent the week complaining about broadcaster NBC’s plan to shut off the candidates’ microphones if they interrupt one another and branding moderator Kristen Welker “terrible” and accusing her of bias.Former president Barack Obama meanwhile gave a rousing speech in support of his former deputy in Philadelphia on Wednesday, tearing into Trump for “fraying the fabric of society”, for his disastrous response to the coronavirus pandemic, for having no vision for the country, for his Chinese bank account and for pushing bogus conspiracy theories on social media.

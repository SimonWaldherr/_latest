<div><p>Republican views of the economy have soured sharply over the past six months &#8211; even more than those of Democrats, a new survey from online job site Indeed finds.</p><p>The firm surveyed more than 4,000 adults aged 18 and over in late September, comparing the results to a survey of 2,000 adults in late February and early March just as the coronavirus pandemic began hitting the country. All respondents were classified according to the party they identify with or, in the case of independents or others, the party they lean toward.</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>The share of Republicans saying economic conditions were excellent or good fell from 77% in March to 46% in September, a drop that far eclipsed the 42% to 24% decline among Democrats. </p><p>That is despite the pandemic having so far been worse for Democrats and blue states than it has been for Republicans and red states. </p><p>"Perceptions of the economy have plummeted since early March," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed. "In late September, 34% of people said economic conditions in the country overall were excellent or good, with the rest saying only fair or poor. That's down from 58% in early March."</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Political Cartoons on the Economy</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/7d9127f/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fc1%2F89%2F95ffddf64bafba51f65ab3512319%2Fsbr101120dapc.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>Overall, "this recession has been worse for Democrats than Republicans," Kolko pointed out, noting that job losses have been almost twice as large in blue states as red states and that unemployment in September was nearly 3 percentage points higher for Democrats. This is largely because the pandemic has hit jobs and industries harder in the service sector than in the goods-producing part of the economy. The service economy tends to be bigger in large cities and metro areas, where voters have historically favored Democrats.</p><p>Though, the Indeed survey found that disparity changed over time with Democratic-leaning places suffering more in the spring during the early phases of the virus and the resultant national lockdown and Republican locales suffering more in the summer and fall. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>The latest findings come just two weeks before Americans go to the polls and as President Donald Trump is arguing that he is the person best able to lead the economy to recovery from the ravages of the coronavirus. Trump has presided over a strong economy, one he inherited from his predecessor Barack Obama, and has frequently asked people to gauge him by the value of the stock market and their 401(k) accounts.</p><p>At a rally in Nevada on Sunday evening, Trump said, "Normal life is all we want. We want to be where we were seven months ago. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country."</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>But Americans have repeatedly faulted the president for his handling of the coronavirus, blaming him for a slow response to the threat early on and for downplaying the severity of the disease. Even after he caught COVID-19 in early October and landed in the hospital, requiring treatment with a combination of drugs and supplemental oxygen, Trump has minimized its effects on the country.</p><p>"The pandemic is what has hurt the economy," Kolko said. "The loss of jobs and rising unemployment are obviously not the result of economic policies."</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, the percentage of people who said their own personal economic circumstances were either excellent or good actually increased from 55% in March to 58% in September, suggesting the proliferation of federal relief efforts may have mitigated some of the effects of the economic downturn.</p><p>Even for those who did not suffer job losses or reductions in income, the additional payments as well as reduced expenses from working at home may have improved individual economic conditions. Many people have deferred or shifted spending away from travel and eating out to home improvement, savings and other things.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>The September poll by Indeed found that views of contentious issues such as universal health insurance and universal basic income &#8211; linchpins of the Democratic Party's economic message &#8211; have grown more favorable among Republicans. </p><p>"Republican support for both universal health care and universal basic income rose six percentage points from March to September," Kolko noted, though these policies are still more favored by Democrats. "It is a big question whether these are permanent shifts or temporary ones."</p><p>Health care is emerging as a flashpoint in the latter stages of the 2020 campaign as the Trump administration is fighting at the Supreme Court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. The nomination of federal judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court to fill the seat of the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg has brought the issue into stark relief with the court set to hear oral arguments in the case one week after the election, by which time the conservative-leaning Barrett is likely to have been confirmed by a Senate led by Republicans.</p><p>Other findings in the Indeed survey:</p><p>&#8211; 24% favored higher tariffs on imported goods, up from 18% in March.</p><p>&#8211; 26% of Democrats reported having fewer hours of work since March, compared to 21% for Republicans.</p><p>&#8211; 23% of Democrats had less work-related income, compared to 19% of Republicans.<br></p></div>

  Sen. Marco Rubio: Joe Biden and packing the Supreme Court -- the dirty little secret Dems don't want to reveal 
description: > 
  And here is the dirty little secret that Democrats do not want the American people to know: it has always been their plan to pack the Supreme Court with liberal judges.In March 2019, my colleagues and I introduced a constitutional amendment that would limit the Supreme Court of the United States to nine justices.It is telling that no Democratic senator has cosponsored my constitutional amendment, which would merely keep the Supreme Court at the same number of seats it has had since 1869.If the left succeeds in packing the Supreme Court, they will be one step closer to erasing our founding and values in pursuit of progressive utopias such as Seattleâ€™s Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.To protect our people, we need to protect our institutions and ensure no one can ever pack the Supreme Court for partisan gains.

The truth is that this has been in the works since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States four years ago.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>The good news is that Senate Republicans saw this coming and began laying the groundwork to push back against the Democrats&#8217; efforts to destroy our institutions.

It is clear they don&#8217;t want to pack the Supreme Court just to cancel out the votes of Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and soon Amy Coney Barrett. They want to pack the Court to cancel out your ability to resist their radical agenda.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>The truth is that this is a major part of the Democratic Party&#8217;s desire to manipulate and coerce our public institutions into being an arm of their radical progressive agenda.

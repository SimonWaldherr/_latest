But claims of racism are unsubstantiated. In 2019, McConnell said he would fill a Supreme Court nominee during an election year. And Trump tapped Barrett for the Supreme Court as a possible tie-breaker vote in the event of&#160;a dispute over the results of the&#160;presidential election next month.&#160;Nonetheless, the timing is a bit off in the claim. There were 123 days between the date of the post and inauguration day on Jan. 20, 2021.&#160;Trump still has a little over 100 days in office, but the claim correctly states Obama had about10 months left in his term when he announced Merrick Garland as his Supreme Court nominee.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><p>Our fact-check sources:</p></h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Thank you for supporting our journalism.

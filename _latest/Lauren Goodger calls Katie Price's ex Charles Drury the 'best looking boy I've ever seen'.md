Lauren teased their romance last week as she shared pictures of her cuddling Charles, who's 11 years her junior, in bed, before cheekily insinuating the pair had made love together.

Charles, who had a brief fling with Katie, 42, in 2019, and branded her 'lazy in bed,' also shared an image he had taken in Lauren's bedroom during the pair's romantic weekend together.

Lauren also called Charles 'the cutest' after he tended to the star while she was unwell the weekend by giving her some products to freshen up.

The builder's fling with Katie took place after the breakdown of her engagement to Kris Boyson, 32, who Lauren has previously been accused of flirting with.

Katie is now in a new relationship with Carl Woods, 31, who first found fame during an appearance on ITV's Love Island.

The former glamour model has declared Carl as 'The One' and the pair got matching tattoo in their latest show of commitment, after being together for four months.

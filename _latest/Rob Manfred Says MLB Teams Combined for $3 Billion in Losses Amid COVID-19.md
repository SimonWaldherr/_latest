  Rob Manfred Says MLB Teams Combined for $3 Billion in Losses Amid COVID-19 
description: > 
  Tony Gutierrez/Associated PressAfter the COVID-19 pandemic forced 898 regular-season games to go on without fans this summer, MLB's 30 teams dropped a combined total of $3 billion in operating losses."The clubs have done a really good job locally and we tried to do a good job centrally," Manfred told Ronald Blum of the Associated Press.While the league would like to do away with the loss of revenue come the 2020-21 season, Manfred noted that he hoped to keep extra-inning runners and expanded playoffs (though not with 16 teams) moving forward.We are gathering feedback from players and weâ€™ll bring that to the league at the appropriate time.Obviously, protecting health and safety will remain among several important considerations as those talks unfold."

Fitbit is one of the most reputable names in fitness wearables, offering a wide variety of activity trackers and smartwatches designed to keep you motivated and improve your fitness.

For Amazon Prime Day 2020, Fitbit's offering discounts of up to 30% off smartwatches like the Versa 2 and Versa Lite, as well as its smart scale, the Aria Air.

If you've been in the market for a do-it-all smartwatch, the Versa 2 is an excellent choice as it offers more than six days of battery life, compatibility with Amazon Alexa, and tracking for a variety of activities, as well as sleep.

Thanks to its wide array of fitness trackers catering to people of all fitness levels, Fitbit became one of the most well-known names in the wearable industry. As the brand grew in popularity, so, too, did its lineup of activity trackers. What started out as a few basic fitness bands have since expanded into an array of full-featured smartwatches and multi-sport activity trackers.

No matter if you're a serious runner who wants to track your mileage or someone who just wants to improve your health and set a few fitness goals, you won't have to look far to find a Fitbit catered to your active lifestyle.

Taking advantage of sales during Amazon Prime Day has often been one of the best ways to join in on the Fitbit craze at a discount — and this year is no different. For the entirety of Prime Day 2020, Fitbit discounted its popular Versa 2 (and Versa 2 Special Edition) and Versa Lite smartwatches, as well as its smart scale, the Aria Air.

Though the Versa 2 and Versa 2 Special Edition are discounted up to 30% off their standard price, it's the Versa Lite in the mulberry color that represents the best deal of the bunch, coming in at 56% off for a price of $69.95. Don't let the Lite in its name fool you either. It's nearly as powerful as the Versa 2 with it's most glaring differences being the lack of onboard storage for music and no on-screen workouts. Otherwise, it offers a nearly identical experience as the Versa 2 for a fraction of the cost.

If you're on the fence about buying either activity tracker, or even if you just want to give a Fitbit as a gift, Prime Day 2020 is the perfect time to take the leap — and it lets you save some money in the process. Check out our Fitbit buying guide for more information on the brand's trackers and which might be the best fit for your lifestyle.

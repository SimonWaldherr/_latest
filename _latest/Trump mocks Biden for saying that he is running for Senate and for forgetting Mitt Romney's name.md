Donald Trump on Monday night mocked his Democrat rival Joe Biden for stating he was 'running for Senate' - using the momentary lapse as more evidence of his claim that Biden is unfit for office.

Trump, 74, has made the age and frequent gaffes of Biden, 77, a recurrent line of attack.

On Monday, campaigning in Toledo, Ohio, Biden provided the president with yet more fodder.

He previously claimed he was running for Senate during a stop in South Carolina in February.

Donald Trump, on stage in Florida on Monday night, was quick to capitalize on the mistake

'You know, we have to come together. That's why I'm running. I'm running as a proud Democrat for the Senate, when I ran as a proud Democrat for vice president, and I'm running as a proud Democrat for president.

'But I promise you this, I will govern as an American president.'

The former vice president was a longtime senator from Delaware.

Biden appeared to make another gaffe on the tarmac, appearing to forget Utah Senator Mitt Romney's name.

'I got in trouble when we were running against that senator who was a Mormon, the governor,' he said.

Romney was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.

Trump seized up on it, tweeting: 'Biden losing big in Florida. Only Fake Polls show otherwise! Bad for Healthcare. Thinks he's running for the Senate. Forgot Mitt Romney's name, and where he was!

''I'm running as a proud Democrat, for the Senate'. Sleepy Joe Biden today. It's only going to get worse. It is not sustainable for our County - China will own us!!!!'

The president was in Sanford, Florida on Monday night and repeated his joke.

'Sleepy Joe Biden, not a nice guy, by the way. He had a very bad day today,' Trump said.

'If I ever had a day like he had today, they'd say: 'It's over. It's over.'

'He forgot Mitt Romney's name. He didn't know what state he was in. And he said today he's a proud Democrat running for the US Senate.'

Trump joked: 'Could you imagine if I did that? 'Great to be with you. It's great to be a wonderful developer from New York.' They'd say: 'he's out of here. Get him out.''

Biden 'has got a lot of bad days coming,' Trump said.

'The one thing I know for sure, President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong Un - they are 100 per cent sharp.

'We have someone running who is not 100 per cent, he's not 80 per cent, he's not 60 per cent.'

Trump was back on the campaign trail on Monday, leaving the White House for the first time

Kylie and Kendall Jenner got into a serious physical fight, causing Kim Kardashian to call security on Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

Kendall, 24, accused Kylie, 23, of 'putting her heel in her neck' during the brawl, leading the sisters to vow to 'never speak to one another again.'

Kim, 39, could be heard shouting: 'It's an emergency! Go get Kendall!' as she listened to her sisters brawling in another vehicle, played over 41-year-old Kourtney's phone.

'F*** you! F*** you!' Kendall, 24, screamed at Kylie, 23, (pictured) as the altercation took place

The row happened because Kendall was upset that Kylie took her outfit during the family getaway in Palm Springs, California.

'F*** you! F*** you!' Kendall, 24, screamed at Kylie, 23, and her mother's boyfriend, Corey Gamble, 39, who was riding with them.

'Stop, stop, stop!' Corey yelled.

'We have to go get Kendall!' Kim told her driver, taking command. 'Turn around, sir!'

'Where are they? This is crazy!' Khloé, 36, exclaimed, as Kendall told Kylie, 'You put your f***ing heel into my f***ing neck!'

Ride argument: Kylie and Kendall argued about riding together as their mother Kris Jenner and half-sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloe listened in

'That's cause you f***ing slapped me!' Kylie yelled back.

In a confessional, Khloé recalled, 'We're just hearing high-pitched screaming. We can't even figure out what's happening, and it just sounds really crazy.'

When Kim's car stopped, a producer ran up and told her, 'They left in the other car.'

'We need to find them,' said a worried looking Kourtney.

Good times: Kris, Kim, Khloe and Kourtney were having a fun ride home when Kendall called in distress

Really crazy: 'In a confessional, Khloé recalled, 'We're just hearing high-pitched screaming. We can't even figure out what's happening, and it just sounds really crazy'

Kendall suddenly crawled into their car, swearing, 'I will never speak to Kylie again, ever.'

The fight was a horrifying moment for the whole family, not least Kris Jenner, 64, who had just been grappling with seeing Kim, Kourtney and Khloé fight in a recent KUWTK episode.

At a KKW Beauty shoot, she told Kim and Khloé that it had been hard to watch her girls argue so vehemently at their age, and she called Kourtney to offer her support.

'Thank you,' Kourtney replied, crying. 'I'm fine now. It's just… it was like everyone was ganging up on me for like two f***ing years.'

'It's just such a natural thing in our family,' she told her mother. 'If someone goes any way against what everyone else is doing, it just seems like they just attack.'

Kris decided to organize a family trip to 'everybody's happy place,' her vacation home in Palm Springs, to ensure that all of her girls were getting along.

She and Corey talked Kendall into going, meeting up with her at a Ferrari dealership, where they were all getting cars.

Corey privately admitted that he was not close to Kendall, but he loved and supported Kris, and would help her daughter if she ever needed him.

The scene in Palm Springs was happy and chaotic, with kids everywhere and coronavirus making everyone just a little nervous to be so close to so many people.

Everyone played a family trivia game, with Kim revealing her favorite color was 'nude' and Kendall saying she had her first kiss at age 12, during a game of truth or dare.

Khloé made a special effort to connect with Kourtney, and the two of them had a great time.

Corey kept to himself, observing, 'With this particular group, my words always get twisted up somehow, some way, so I tend to just be quiet so that Kris don't have to stress out.'

He was thrilled when Kylie unexpectedly showed up the next day, describing her as his 'ace,' a happy person who checked in on him more than anyone else in the family.

Kendall had been looking forward to seeing her sister, too, but was secretly wary of whether or not she would show up at all as she often missed them.

Scott Disick, 37, who was there with his three kids, rode around Kris' place on a motorized toy engine, and broke a vintage lamp he initially denied even seeing.

Finally confessed: Kris tried to find the culprit and Scott finally took responsibility

After Kris quizzed her grandkids and the staff, he confessed, wanting to set a good example for his son Mason, 10.

'Don't you feel bad?' Mason had asked him. 'You should just tell her. If you admit it to her now, she'll think you're a better person.'

'Who raised you to be such a good kid?' Scott asked, to which Mason said, 'My mom.'

Bikini time: Kylie wore a bikini while enjoying the pool at her mother's Palm Springs home

Selfie time: Kendall took a selfie by the pool in a skimpy red swimsuit

As the night closed in, all of the Kardashian sisters went to a drag show together, with Kylie saying she was looking forward to 'getting loose' and maintaining 'positive vibes.'

'It's such a blessing you're here, 'cause when you're not here, it's not the same, and I mean that in real life,' Corey told her. 'Without you, it's f***ing just off.'

'I love Corey,' Kylie said in a confessional. 'I think that he's just an amazing person, I think he treats my mom amazing, and he's just helped me navigate through life, and I really appreciate his advice. He's just always been a good, good guy.'

Kylie got dressed in a sexy outfit she borrowed from Kourtney, which upset Kendall, who'd planned to wear it and complained, 'everyone bows down to Kylie.'

The makeup mogul did shots with Corey and asked her older sister if she thought she deserved the outfit more, adding, 'You're not going to ruin my f***ing night.'

'You ruined my f***ing night, so I can do whatever the f*** I want to,' Kendall yelled.

Kylie, Kris and Corey drove to a restaurant together for dinner, with Corey cracking, 'Ain't nobody gonna steal our vibes.'

They grimaced when they thought of heading back to Los Angeles that night with Kendall, as planned.

When Scott left dinner for home, Kendall mourned the fact that she hadn't gone with him.

Lunch outfit: Kendall complained that she looked like she was going to lunch while everyone else was all dressed up

Early exit: Scott and Mason left early and Kendall moped that she would've left with them

Everyone left for the drag show and Khloé climbed into Kylie, Corey and Kris' car, saying, 'We just ditched Kourtney, Kim and Kendall, because they are so boooooring!'

'Who has the better car?!' Kylie preened, as she shot photos for Instagram. 'We do!'

Kendall, who like Kim and Kourtney wasn't really drinking, skipped out on the drag show to take a nap in Kylie's car, which she'd be taking home.

Better car: 'Who has the better car?!' Kylie preened, as she shot photos for Instagram. 'We do!'

Inside, Kourtney, Khloé, Kim and Kris laughed uproariously at the raucous drag show.

After it was over, Kylie piled into her car with Kourtney and told the driver she needed to go to the bathroom somewhere, which led Kendall to ask whether she should give the man her Beverly Hills address for a drop-off.

'Why would I drop you home, Kendall?' Kylie asked her sister gently. 'I'm not going through the city to drop you home.'

'Wait, do you want your own Escalade?' Corey asked the model.

Seconds later, Kendall called Kourtney, who put her on speaker so Kim, Khloé and Kris could hear.

'Corey, I'm not getting in a f***ing [unintelligible] by myself!' Kendall protested. 'Corey, please!'

Driving dispute: After it was over, Kylie piled into her car with Kourtney and told the driver she needed to go to the bathroom somewhere, which led Kendall to ask whether she should give the man her Beverly Hills address for a drop-off

'Kendall! No one's tripping!' Kylie shouted back. 'No one promised to drive you home! Why would I drive you home?'

'You did!' Kendall screamed, as Kylie screeched, 'Why would I drive you over the hill?' and things devolved from there.

Kim called security as she heard Kendall claim Kylie put a high heel to her neck, and Kylie said Kendall slapped her.

Urgent action: Corey could be heard telling them to stop fighting

They went to pick Kendall up at a gas station, still hearing her ask Kylie, 'Why would I make that up?'

'This man is wild,' Kendall told her sisters of Corey over the phone. 'He really did just say, ''F*** you,'' to me.'

'Obviously we believe you,' Khloé returned, as Kourtney offered, 'Corey cannot say that to you.'

Wild man: 'This man is wild,' Kendall told her sisters of Corey over the phone. 'He really did just say, ''F*** you,'' to me'

Kylie later claimed that all she remembered Corey doing was trying to break up the fight.

Kris was devastated, telling the cameras, 'Listening to the girls argue or fight, it really breaks my heart. And to see everything spiral out of control—it's crazy.'

Kendall crawled into their car, vowing to never talk to her sister again.

Safe space: Kendall crawled into their car, vowing to never talk to her sister again and told her family what happened

'They just left you?' Kris asked, disbelieving, to which Kendall said, 'Yes, mom!'

In her own confessional, Kendall noted that the incident surprised her.

'I don't think I ever would have thought either of them were capable of taking it to that level with me,' she reflected. 'Especially 'cause I was just kinda chillin' and asked a simple question. I just didn't ever see it needing to get to that point, and I already know Kylie is gonna downplay the situation and make it seem like she did nothing wrong.'

That level: 'I don't think I ever would have thought either of them were capable of taking it to that level with me,' Kendall said in a confessional

Kendall said that when she asked to go home, Corey ordered their driver to stop the car so they could get her another car.

'Like, no,' Kendall moaned. 'Why would I drive all the way by myself?'

'It's not his place to dictate that,' Khloé reassured her, and Kendall agreed.

Foul language: The model complained that Corey used foul language with her

'That's what I said, I said, ''Corey, shut up!'',' she recalled. 'You're not even trying to be helpful. You want me out of this car.'

Kris' phone rang, and Kendall said, 'Do not answer! To which Kris said, 'I'm not.'

Kendall told her family, 'That's when Corey said, on everything, ''F*** you!'' and then turns around to the front, and I said, ''F*** you! You're gonna say 'F*** you?'' And that's when I started getting hysterical. 'Cause she was like, ''He didn't say, ''F*** you!'' I heard. I was listening to the whole—'' and I was like, ''I'm dead sober. I wouldn't make s*** up!'''

'Then she smacked me, so I came back at her, smacked her in the face, and then she just took her heel and put it into my neck. So I started kicking her back. We got in a full fight,' Kendall revealed.

'The fact that my sister, my blood, was reacting this way just makes this so upsetting,' the top model cried.

Kim immediately got a text from Kylie, who said, 'You guys know I'm a sane person. Kendall said, ''Will you drop me off?'' And I said, ''No, I never agreed to that.'' Kendall's been in a bada** mood all f***ing day. That s*** was crazy.'

Other side: Kim immediately got a text from Kylie, who said, 'You guys know I'm a sane person. Kendall said, ''Will you drop me off?'' And I said, ''No, I never agreed to that.'' Kendall's been in a bada** mood all f***ing day. That s*** was crazy.'

Kylie said privately it was a 'miscommunication,' admitting, 'Things just got very out of hand.'

'I don't know how I'll be able to forget this,' Kendall told her sisters, as they returned to Palm Springs. 'I really don't.'

She declared that she was 'pretty offended and hurt,' and felt 'super-disrespected.'

Kim and Khloé felt equally bad for Kris, aware of how hard fights like this were on her.

'We came on this trip to try to reconnect all of us together and forget about the sister fight between Kourtney, Kim, myself,' Khloé said in a confessional. 'Now we're ending this trip with another sister fight between Kendall and Kylie?'

In a sneak peek of next week's episode, Kendall said she still hadn't spoken to Kylie, and was waiting for an apology, as Khloé opined that the two of them 'haven't fought like this in years.'

Keeping Up With The Kardashians will return next week on the E! network.

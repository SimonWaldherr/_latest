Business Insider is proud to announce that Robert Lewandowski will speak at the inaugural BI Global Trends Festival, a virtual event taking place the week of October 19-23, 2020.

Lewandowski is the captain of the Poland national football team and plays as a striker for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich. He is the Poland national team's all-time top scorer and Bundesliga's all-time number three scorer.

On stage at Business Insider's virtual conference, Lewandowski will talk about his experience and challenges he faces as a team leader — and not just on the football field.

"Self-discipline, strong will, perseverance, ability to make instant decisions and to draw conclusions from wins and losses are the desired traits of any athlete, and they are increasingly decisive to business successes," Lewandowki said. "Both these domains also require a leader, a captain."

Lewandowski is an investor in long-term technology and real estate development projects, trading and service platforms, and products for athletes. His investments include a stake in Movie Games, a computer games developer and publisher listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and SamuraiLabs, which aims to detect and prevent online violence.

Hear Lewandowski discuss how to spot opportunities, how to motivate yourself and others, and how to keep focused on a goal in difficult situations. His session "The Focused Leader: How to maintain focus and peak performance in challenging times" is scheduled for Friday 23 October at 18:25 CEST on the event's Global Stage.

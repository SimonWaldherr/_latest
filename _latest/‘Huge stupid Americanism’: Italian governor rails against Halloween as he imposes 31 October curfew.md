  ‘Huge stupid Americanism’: Italian governor rails against Halloween as he imposes 31 October curfew 
description: > 
  An Italian governor has promised to impose a regional curfew on 31 October to slow the spread of coronavirus, branding Halloween a “huge stupid Americanism”."Halloween is this huge piece of nonsense, this huge stupid Americanism that has also been imported into our country," Mr De Luca said in a Friday briefing broadcast on Facebook.Halloween has only recently become popular in Italy, but the following day, 1 November, has long been a public holiday in the country to mark All Saints Day.On Thursday, Mr De Luca also announced he was closing schools in the region for two weeks.Mr De Luca’s comments come just months after he threatened in March to send police with flamethrowers to break up student parties as the pandemic raged.

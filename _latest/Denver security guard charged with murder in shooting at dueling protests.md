<p>William Boyle, a lawyer for Keltner&#8217;s widow, said Friday that he thinks the evidence available supports a second-degree murder charge.</p><p>Boyle said he has reached out to KUSA-TV, Pinkerton and Isborn Security, the security company that said it hired Dolloff for the work as a contractor to Pinkerton, seeking more information about their actions. He said he did not immediately hear back from them and that a lawsuit against any entity involved in allowing Dolloff to work without a license was a possibility in order to &#8220;open a conversation.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We are just trying to find out exactly what happened, why it happened and who is responsible for creating the situation that resulted in Mr. Keltner&#8217;s death,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>Police say Keltner was in a verbal dispute with a 27-year-old man when Dolloff and a 25-year-old person got into an altercation with Keltner. Two opposing rallies &#8212; a &#8220;Patriot Muster&#8221; and a &#8220;BLM-Antifa Soup Drive&#8221; counter-protest &#8212; had just broken up in downtown Denver.</p><p>Keltner slapped Dolloff in the head, and Dolloff pulled out a semiautomatic handgun and shot Keltner as Keltner discharged pepper spray at him, police said in an arrest affidavit.</p><p>A cellphone video taken by KUSA&#8217;s producer suggests that Keltner was upset that his dispute with the first man was being recorded by cameras.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

A man&#8217;s voice &#8212; whose is unclear &#8212; is heard saying that the area was no place for cameras.</p><p>&#8220;Get the cameras out of here or I&#8217;m going to f&#8212; you up,&#8221; the unidentified man says. Keltner and Dolloff are then shown scuffling before the video stops. </p><p>The producer resumes filming after the shooting and tells arriving police that he is with the press and says of the man who was shot, &#8220;That guy was going to get me.&#8221; He also says the security guard shot Keltner because Keltner used Mace.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

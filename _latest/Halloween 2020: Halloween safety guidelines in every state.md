The coronavirus pandemic might be changing Halloween, but it's still possible to celebrate the spooky holiday safely.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidance earlier in the fall about how families can stay safe during the fall holidays. While traditional activities like trick-or-treating and visiting haunted houses are discouraged this year, the guidelines note that socially distanced pumpkin carving, scavenger hunts and household movie nights can be a great way to enjoy the holiday. If families do go trick-or-treating, a costume face mask is not a substitute for a cloth face mask.

Many states have started to release their own guidance and recommendations, though most of their guidelines are in line with the CDC's. TODAY Parents has rounded up every state's current recommendations for Halloween 2020.

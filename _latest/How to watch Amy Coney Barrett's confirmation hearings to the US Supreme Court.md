The Senate Judiciary Committee began confirmation hearings Monday morning to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett. The hearings kick off an accelerated process to confirm Barrett before the November 3 presidential election.

Barrett was nominated by President Donald Trump to fill the seat vacated by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on September 18 at the age of 87 from pancreatic cancer.

After opening statements, Barrett will undergo two long long days of questioning on her judicial record and philosophy before the committee goes to a vote.

Who is Amy Coney Barrett?

Barrett, a favored pick of social conservatives, was nominated and confirmed to serve as a federal judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago in 2017.

Previously, she served for fifteen years as a law professor teaching constitutional law, statutory interpretation, and the federal courts at the University of Notre Dame, where she was lauded for her scholarship and beloved by students.

A star student in law school, Coney Barrett served in clerkships for Judge Laurence Silberman of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and for former Associate Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court, who she now identifies as her top mentor.

Coney Barrett was one of Scalia's favorite clerks, and largely embodies his judicial philosophy of textualism, The New York Times reported.

At age 48, Coney Barrett could serve decades on the court if confirmed. She is also the mother of seven children and would be the first mother of school-aged children to serve on the high court.

How long will hearings run?

Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham said that the first day of the hearings will consist of opening statements, in which every member and Barrett herself will have ten minutes to speak.

The first day of statements is set to wrap up Monday afternoon. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Barrett will undergo two intense days of questioning from members about her judicial philosophy, her record on the bench so far, and how she might rule on future cases â€” especially those related to healthcare.

The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Democrats are expected to put a narrow, laser-focus on Barrett's position on the Affordable Care Act, the landmark 2009 healthcare legislation that is currently being challenged in court by Republicans.

On Thursday, the Committee will hear from a number of outside witnesses and legal experts testifying in favor of and against Barrett's confirmation to the Court.

After four days of hearings, Graham said, the Judiciary Committee will go to markup to vote on advancing her confirmation to the Senate floor on October 22.

The cruise ship, which continued on its journey carrying all French passengers, will cut its&#160;voyage short as France <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/10/14/covid-news-hawaii-tourism-donald-trump-iowa-delta/3645132001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">has reinstated its state of health emergency&#160;in relation to COVID-19</a>.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Costa Diadema, which was chartered by a&#160;French company and had all French passengers, departed from Genoa on Sept. 28 and&#160;ended its journey&#160;on Oct. 12. It then departed on a second 14-day voyage with many of the same passengers on board Oct. 12&#160;and returned to&#160;Genoa on Friday 10 days earlier than intended.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On&#160;Oct. 10, seven passengers from the first sailing disembarked in Palermo after testing positive for COVID-19.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-cruises-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"All guests were tested and required to be negative to board," Frizzell said.&#160;"Following excursions in Greek islands, (they were)&#160;tested again before returning to Italy, and seven preliminarily tested positive." As part of the cruise line's coronavirus protocols, passengers are required to be tested&#160;if they leave the country of the ship's origin&#160;and return to that country in accordance with Italian law.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Costa Diadema was built by Costa Cruises in 2014."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After the news of the positive tests came and the passengers disembarked, they were&#160;retested in facilities in Palermo. "(They)&#160;were isolated and immediately disembarked in dedicated onshore facilities in Palermo in agreement with Italian health authorities, per protocol," Frizzell said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A third test&#160;on shore was also positive for all seven, who were asymptomatic.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The first sailing&#160;continued on as planned after disembarking the affected passengers in Palermo and made excursions, including stops in&#160;Sardinia and Civitavecchia near Rome, before wrapping up its voyage and then departing for the second voyage Oct. 12.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-travel-cruises-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On the Diadema, Costa was "piloting" new contact tracing technology, Frizzell said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">As a result of the contact tracing, Costa identified one other passenger who displayed symptoms of COVID-19. That passenger was tested on board and retested shoreside and was&#160;positive for COVID-19.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"They disembarked one other passenger at a port of call who had symptoms. That was in Naples," he said. "All the guests were tested after that before they came into Genoa."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">All other passengers tested negative.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Based on the epidemiological situation in France and the new limitations introduced by the French government on Oct. 14, we took the decision to anticipate the end of the cruise,"&#160;Costa Cruises said in a statement provided by Frizzell.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The responsible choice was taken in order to allow a safe return of passengers to their country," the cruise line continued.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/10/14/covid-news-hawaii-tourism-donald-trump-iowa-delta/3645132001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Earlier this week</a>, French President Emmanuel Macron&#160;reinstated the country's state of health emergency, which ended three months ago.

The self-centred are not necessarily self-aware, and there was to Giles Auty an air of innocence, even naivety, that was a saving grace and charm. While never reticent in talking about himself, his talents and achievements, such talk was hardly ever without interest or amusement.

Tall, athletic, good-looking in his dark way, as attractive to women as they were to him, cultivated, wide in his enthusiasms, secure in his prejudices and superstitions, there was much to like and admire in him.

Bird-watching, in which he was deeply knowledgeable, had been a particular interest since childhood, and his schooldays confirmed his enduring commitment to games, and especially to tennis and cricket.

Well into middle age he played tennis with his regular doubles partner at Queen’s, the distinguished art dealer, the late Andras Kalman, who as a young man had represented Hungary.

And as an amateur cricketer he was of minor county class, taking the new ball first for Dorset and later for Cornwall, for which he last turned out at the age of 40. One of his enduring superstitions was that if his guilty secret, his love of sport, were ever to get out, any reputation he had as a serious artist would be ruined.

Giles Auty, of putative Huguenot ancestry, was born on November 1 1934 at Faversham in Kent, where his father was a master at the grammar school. A scholarship took him to Bancroft’s School at Woodford Green, Essex, where, though he was undistinguished academically, sport and art took hold. National Service with the RAF followed in units in the UK and Germany, after which he chose to travel and take odd jobs for a while before determining to become a painter.

Rather than choosing an art school, he took himself off to the far west of Cornwall, for which he came to feel a deep and natural affinity. And there, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, in and around Penzance and St Ives, he fell in with all the principal artists of the Modern Cornish School.

He regularly returned in later years, and would often join three old friends, the painters Roger Hilton and Bryan Wynter, and the poet W S Graham, in a favoured haunt of theirs, the Gurnard’s Head, a remote and often deserted pub in the wilds beyond Zennor.

The pub was run by Jimmy Goodman, a misanthropic ex-officer, one of whose cherished bêtes noires was anyone to do with films or filming. On one such evening, so Auty like to relate, at the time when the strange Cornish cowboy film, Straw Dogs, was being shot on location at St Buryan nearby, “the strikingly pretty actress, Susan George, burst in saying, ‘I’m Susan George and I’m looking for my co-star Dustin Hoffman’. Jimmy pondered her request slowly before finally replying thus: ‘I’ve been the landlord here for many years m’dear, and can assure you that there are no coastguards of that name working in this area.’ ”

As a painter himself, Giles worked mainly from landscape or architectural subjects, closely observed and meticulously drawn, quiet in mood, undemonstrative in the handling and generally small in scale. Living by his work, he exhibited frequently if irregularly until, on taking up the post on The Spectator, he more or less stopped painting, though he did still show occasionally as opportunity arose.

He would return properly to painting only many years later in his semi-retirement in Australia; he upped sticks in 1995 in frustration at what he saw as the constraint of writing for a periodical, his failure to achieve promotion to a national newspaper, and the general lack of being appreciated, so he felt, at his worth.

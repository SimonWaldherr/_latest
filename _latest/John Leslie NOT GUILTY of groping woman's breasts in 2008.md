However, the case will do little to rehabilitate his battered reputation, with his own lawyer branding him an 'embarrassment'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leslie's career first took a downward spiral when he was falsely accused of raping Ulrika Jonsson by the TV presenter Matthew Wright. Wright later apologised, saying he had given his name in error.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Several other women have made claims of sexual misconduct against Leslie, and he was&#160;arrested in December 2002 on one count of rape and two concerning indecent assault.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In June 2003, he was charged with assaulting a woman twice between May 25 and 28 1997. The charges were dropped at Southwark Crown Court on July 31, 2003 after new information emerged about the alleged victim.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he remained the subject of scandal, with photographs emerging of him taking cocaine, along with a video of a threesome involving Leslie and his then girlfriend Abi Titmuss, a nurse who went on to become a glamour model.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Judge Deborah Taylor, using Leslie's legal name, said today: 'Mr Stott, you for the second time leave this court without a stain on your character and I hope it will be the last time you have to attend.'&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He had been defended by former Blue Peter colleagues including Anthea Turner and Diane-Louise Jordan. Turner today posted a photo of her and Jordan with Leslie after they gave testimony at his trial, with a caption reading 'not guilty!'&#160;</p><img id="i-7a8071508dfb65c7" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="670" width="962" alt="John Leslie walking free from court today after he was found not guilty by a jury over claims he grabbed a woman's breasts at a Christmas party in central London on December 5, 2008" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-7a8071508dfb65c7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/16/34578138-8855887-John_Leslie_walking_free_from_court_today_after_he_was_found_not-m-43_1603121626529.jpg" height="670" width="962" alt="John Leslie walking free from court today after he was found not guilty by a jury over claims he grabbed a woman's breasts at a Christmas party in central London on December 5, 2008" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="clear"></p><p class="imageCaption">John Leslie walking free from court today after he was found not guilty by a jury over claims he grabbed a woman's breasts at a Christmas party in central London on December 5, 2008</p><img id="i-eb58a32f3e998e4a" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="615" width="962" alt="Anthea Turner celebrated the not guilty verdict with this Instagram post.

They can ruin you without a single shred of evidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'People with all sort of motives can say anything about you. It's difficult to defend yourself against that isn't it?'&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Summing up the defence, Ms Young accused the alleged victim of being unreliable and claimed she was influenced by his 'notorious' reputation.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's her undoubtedly imperfect memory of an event 12 years ago that lasted three seconds or thereabouts,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The briefest sliver of time.

There was no reason to speak to her or meet her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The idea I would do that is just crazy, especially the way I was and everything that had been going on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I was paranoid [after previous allegations]. I was aware, conscious. To go up to a total stranger and just do that would be ludicrous and never would have happened. I can't imagine why she thought it would've happened.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I would've said hello, but not touched her and walked off. It's not me. It never would have happened.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also said: 'It's not a backward industry. We treat women fairly. People don't go around assaulting women. It's just not done.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You wouldn't let it happen. It's not allowed. It's not something people would condone or allow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'People wouldn't watch it and let it happen. If I had seen it I wouldn't have let it happen. I would never do such a thing.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leslie made no comment as he left court alongside his father, and his barrister Gudrun Young.&#160;</p><img

squeaky clean Blue Peter presenter to being dogged by scandals including false Ulrika Jonsson rape claim and threesome sex tape with Abi Titmuss</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John Leslie was today cleared of sexual assault, but the news will come too late for a man who went from a squeaky clean&#160;Blue Peter presenter to being repeatedly dogged by scandals.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 55-year-old, who also presented This Morning, was found not guilty by a jury over claims he grabbed a woman's breasts at a Christmas party in central London on December 5, 2008.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before the trial, Leslie had already been investigated an astonishing number of times over separate sexual assault allegations made to police since 2002, when he was falsely accused of raping&#160;Ulrika Jonsson.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dozens of other women have publicly accused him of similar seedy behaviour, while he has been the subject of salacious revelations about his sex life (including his starring role in a threesome sex tape with Abi Titmuss) and his use of cocaine.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A string of former Blue Peter presenters rallied around Leslie at his trial, with Anthea Turner, Diane Louise Jordan and Yvette Fielding taking to the stand to call him a 'gentleman' and deny he was ever inappropriate towards women.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leslie has never been found guilty of any offence, but his own barrister today claimed he had become a 'notorious' and a 'nobody' because of the repeated claims against him.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The former star, who once earned&#160;&#163;350,000 a year, was last known to be living in an Edinburgh bungalow and doing DJ jobs to earn extra money.&#160;</p><img id="i-e3ce99cd7e80ac45" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="712" width="962" alt="John Leslie

Wright&#160;as Ulrika Jonsson's rapist that she wrote about anonymously in her 2002 autobiography.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wright subsequently said he could not remember saying Leslie's name during the show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a Sky One show, Wright offered John Leslie an apology. Leslie confirmed he would not sue Wright, saying: 'I think he just made a really big mistake and unfortunately I was the one paying the price.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jonsson made no public comment on Leslie's naming and did not cooperate with police over the matter.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Leslie later appeared on the court steps where he said, while visibly shaking:&#160;'I am an innocent man.

'That was when I realised I was earning decent money.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He then started presenting Wheel of Fortune, initially filming three shows a week at &#163;2,000 a show. His income was further boosted to &#163;350,000 a year when, in 2001, he began presenting This Morning with Fern Britton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While he was at Blue Peter, he dated the actress Catherine Zeta-Jones for 18 months, admitting in later years that she was the only woman he ever truly loved.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I should have been far more responsible, sensitive and aware,' he has said. 'Someone said if I'd been a rock star it would have been accepted, whereas because I was a Blue Peter presenter, people were out to get me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I didn't know how to handle my private life. The party was 24/7 and I trusted too many people, and soon enough the wheels were going to come off.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2003,&#160;Leslie famously left the court having been told that he did so 'without a stain on his character'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the damage had been done. Photographs had emerged of him taking cocaine, and a stolen sex tape of a threesome involving Leslie and his then girlfriend Abi Titmuss, a nurse who went on to become a glamour model, was leaked on the internet.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With a &#163;500,000 legal bill to pay, and with ITV having ended his contract, Leslie was forced to look elsewhere for funds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No doubt imagining that his career would one day be revived, he turned his hand to property developing.

Thursday's competing town halls provided the perfect inspiration for the cold open on "Saturday Night Live."

The sketch show kicked off the weekend's program with "flipping" back and forth between ABC's town hall with the vibe of a "poorly attended college lecture" hosted by Mikey Day's George Stephanopoulos, featuring the return of Jim Carrey's former vice president Joe Biden, who Day dubbed a "future oatmeal spokesman."

But, as in real life, the excitement began when "SNL" flipped over to Kate McKinnon as "surprise bad-ass" Savannah Guthrie, or "Serengeti" as Alec Baldwin's President Donald Trump called her.

"If you were angry at NBC for doing this town hall, just let me get a few questions in, and I think you'll thank me," said McKinnon's Guthrie.

"I'd like to start by tearing you a new one," she said before asking about white supremacy and criticizing his Twitter habits: "You're not just someone's crazy uncle."

It became too much for Maya Rudolph's Kamala Harris when a zealous Black Trump supporter, shown over his shoulder, kept nodding enthusiastically and, at one point, got out of her seat and began dancing.

Rudolph's Harris said: "Somebody has to ask: what the hell is happening with that woman back there? 'Cause I only nod that much when a waiter asks if I'll be having mimosas at brunch." She felt it was some "Jordan Peele-nonsense."

Meanwhile, Carrey's Biden soothed a small audience while putting on a cardigan and singing, "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" And later Carrey's Biden adopted a Bob Ross persona, with paintbrush and all.

Over on NBC, it was "WrestleMania," where McKinnon's Guthrie hit Baldwin's Trump with a folding chair.

  False Political News in Spanish Pits Latino Voters Against Black Lives Matter 
description: > 
  “This matter was handled internally and there are no further comments,” Adib Edén, the president of Actualidad Media Group, said in an email, without elaborating on what internal action was taken.Many experts fear that the conspiracy theories are more dangerous amid the coronavirus pandemic, when people are searching online for information to keep themselves safe.Misinformation proliferates first online, then is often shared on WhatsApp, which is particularly popular among Latino immigrants.Though this is most problematic in Florida, there is evidence of it spreading throughout the country.“It’s painful and scary to see people you love and think should know better fall into these traps,” she said.

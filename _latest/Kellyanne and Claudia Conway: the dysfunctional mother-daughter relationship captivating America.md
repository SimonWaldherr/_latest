It is the most dysfunctional mother-daughter dynamic since Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis duked it out in the film Freaky Friday.

The tempestuous relationship between Donald Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway and her emphatically Democrat-supporting teenage daughter, Claudia, has kept America entertained for months.

Now the soap opera that is their family life has taken an explosive twist, after Conway became infected with coronavirus having attended a so-called “super-spreader” event at the White House and, allegedly, passed the disease on to her daughter.

Loose cannon Claudia has complained she is “dying” of Covid, cast doubt on Trump’s claims to be healthy following his hospitalisation with the disease and filmed her mother ordering her to retract a previous post in which she accused Conway of “lying” about her test results. All in the space of 24 hours. Little wonder their fraught family battle has made headlines worldwide.

Fifteen-year-old Claudia has become a social media star for posting excoriating messages on Twitter and the video sharing site TikTok in which she accused President Trump of being a racist, homophobic tyrant and sexual abuser of women, who’s more interested in playing golf than tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.

Ouch.

She has also expressed her support for the Black Lives Matter movement and urged young people to register to vote in order to get Trump out of the White House.

Over the summer, she tweeted that she was seeking emancipation from her parents as a result of “years of childhood abuse and trauma".

The bombardment appeared to have died down after Conway, 53, and her husband, George, an attorney who is also a Trump critic, ordered Claudia to suspend her profile and temporarily confiscated her phone.

Conway also stepped down from her role as counsellor to the President, saying she wanted to spend more time with her four children now they were being forced to home-school as a result of the pandemic.

But she remained close enough to the Trump inner circle to be invited to an event at the White House Rose Garden at which the President unveiled judge Amy Coney Barrett as his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

That ceremony has since emerged as a super-spreader event, with at least eight of the attendees, including Conway, Trump and his wife Melania, going on to test positive for coronavirus. Like the President and most of the guests, Conway did not wear a mask or abide by social distancing guidelines.

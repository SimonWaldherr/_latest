Hari Kunzru’s new novel, “Red Pill,” takes its title from a conspiratorial, increasingly well-known political phrase adapted from the film “The Matrix.” To take the red pill is to have the scales fall from one’s eyes — to see the dark forces directing reality from behind the scenes.

“I was thinking about surveillance and privacy, first of all,” Kunzru says about the inspiration for his novel. “And I came toward a writer character who had a set of rather comfortable, I would say complacent liberal ideas, and who was finding his sense of himself altered by the fact that he was feeling watched all the time. And then that fused with this other set of ideas about red-pilling and about the idea that, in my opinion, there has been a great complacency in the political center about really addressing some of the fringe ideas that have now come into the mainstream.”

'After months of consideration and many long and thoughtful conversations, Fraser and I have decided to separate. As you can imagine, this is an incredibly hard time for us as a family.'

The reality star added: 'This year has provided so many uncertainties and forced us to postpone and eventually cancel our wedding as well as being new and full time parents and government closures of businesses.

'Ottilie is our world and remains our number one priority. We also share so much love and respect for one another and our beautiful daughter and we are eager for her to grow up watching us mature into a modern family, as close friends.

'Fraser is the most incredible father and it fills me with great sadness that we have been unable to make our relationship work.'

She ended: 'We still love each other very much and know that our future is better and more stable this way.

'As we find our feet and navigate our new relationship, we ask for respect and kindness.

'We may be a little quieter than usual as we settle into our new normal and we thank you in advance for your love and support.

'This is all Fraser and myself will be commenting on this matter at this delicate time.

'The community that we have formed together on this platform means the world to me and I am looking forward to sharing our ongoing journey as honestly and openly as I am able to, with you. With love, Tabitha, Fraser and Ottilie.'

Fraser proposed during a trip to Miami in November 2019, with a three-carat diamond engagement ring designed by Eden Rocks, the company run by MIC pal Spencer who was also expected to attend the wedding.

Speaking to FEMAIL in January last year, Tabitha remembered how her relationship with Fraser began, explaining: 'I started working as a marketing director at Albert's Private Members' Club in 2016 where Fraser and I met.

'It quickly became romantic but we kept very quiet as he was my boss. It was very on-off for a long time before we became official and moved in together in November 2017.

'But moving in was probably too hasty at the time as this led to us breaking up. I was broken-hearted dived head first into filming for Made in Chelsea.'

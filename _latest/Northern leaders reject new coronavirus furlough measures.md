Northern leaders have rejected the Government's new local Covid-19 furlough scheme - saying it would plunge thousands into "severe hardship" - as a tougher lockdown looms.

Pub and restaurant workers would be among those unable to pay their bills, businesses would be forced to close, and the North-South divide would "widen" despite Chancellor Rishi Sunak's financial aid package, warned Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham.

Ahead of further talks with ministers, the leaders of Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Tyneside said the scheme - which would see the Government pay two-thirds of staff wages if businesses are forced to shut under new lockdown measures - doesn't go far enough an would have a devastating impact on local economies.

Mr Burnham said they wouldn't rule out a legal challenge as he called the scheme unfair because it would pay less than the national furlough scheme, which covered 80 per cent of wages.

The leaders called for a vote in Parliament on the financial plan as they heaped pressure on northern MPs to back them, including new Tory MPs who stole seats from Labour in last year's general election.

Boris Johnson is set to outline a new three-tiered system of restrictions on Monday with measures expected to see pubs and restaurants to shut across the North of England.

Mr Burnham told reporters: "We were told yesterday the financial package that would accompany any new system of restrictions, as announced by the Chancellor yesterday afternoon, was final and non-negotiable.

"And I have to say, we cannot accept that.

"This package only appeared late in the day, and at the start of the week there was not going to be any financial package at all.

"Following pressure from mayors and other leaders that changed.

"But the analysis we have done of that package, and we've took time to digest what the Chancellor had said, the conclusion we have reached is this package is insufficient to protect our communities as we go into the rest of the autumn and the winter."

Mr Burnham said proposals to pay two-thirds of wages will hit the lowest paid, those on minimum or living wages.

He said: "These people can't choose to pay two-thirds of their rent or two-thirds of their bills."

He also suggested the timing of the proposals could leave people without any financial support for several weeks, with some first payments only due in December.

"That would leave people with no money for a period of six weeks and could push them into debt and severe hardship."

Mr Burnham said negotiations about the lockdown in the North was ongoing but he was told by a "senior figure in Number 10" that the proposed financial help was "non-negotiable."

"I'm angry actually about being told the effect on people's lives is non-negotiable," he said.

"We will not surrender our constituents to hardship nor our businesses to failure."

Mr Burnham and Steve Rotheram, mayor of Liverpool city region, said the new financial package should match the national furlough scheme and cover 80 per cent of wages instead of 67 per cent.

Mr Burnham said any new restrictions must come with a suitable financial plan and the ability to take control of the test and trace programme at a local level.

Mr Rotheram said the leaders were due to "thrash out" the issues with Downing Street on Saturday afternoon.

Liverpool was "in the same boat" as others in the north of England, he said, adding: "We are actually talking about lives and livelihoods.

"Imposing new restrictions without also providing adequate funding and support is simply not acceptable."

The Government should be offering to pay 80 per cent of peoples wages if their employment is locked down, he said.

He added: "If 80% was the right benchmark in March, nothing has changed. If it's right then, it's right now."

He said the Government "can't do lockdown on the cheap".

Mr Burnham said he was calling for cross-party support from MPs across the North for a vote in Parliament on the support proposals announced by the Chancellor on Friday.

"I would not rule out a legal challenge. Why do we accept hospitality workers are somehow second class citizens? I don't accept it," he said.

"This goes to the heart of everything we care about.

"The North of England is staring the most dangerous winter for years right in the face."

What is the Government's plan for wage support?

Workers in pubs, restaurants and other businesses which are forced to close under new coronavirus restrictions will have two thirds of their wages paid by the Government for up to six months, the Chancellor announced on Friday.

Mr Sunak said the expansion of the Job Support Scheme would protect jobs and provide "reassurance and a safety net" for people and businesses across the UK in advance of a potentially "difficult winter".

He insisted that the new support was "very different" to furlough, which he previously declined to extend - arguing it was "fundamentally wrong" to hold people in jobs that only existed inside the scheme.

The support will see the Government pay two thirds of each employee's salary - up to a maximum of £2,100 a month - if their employer is legally required to close their premises because of restrictions.

It will launch on November 1 and last for six months.

Businesses will be able to claim the grant when they are subject to restrictions and employees are off work for at least seven consecutive days.

Venues which are already legally closed, such as nightclubs, will also be eligible.

A Treasury source said the scheme was expected to cost "hundreds of millions a month" but that costings would depend on "how things develop" across different sectors and areas of the country.

The new support is less generous for employees than the furlough scheme, which paid 80% of millions of workers' wages, but it is more generous for employers who are now having to contribute to staff wages as furlough is tapered before ending this month.

Employers will not be required to contribute towards wages, but will be asked to cover national insurance and pension contributions.

The Treasury estimates that, for at least half those employees covered by the new support, firms will not have to pay anything at all.

Ministers will also increase cash grants to businesses in England which are forced to close to support with fixed costs, with the grants linked to rateable values.

Up to £3,000 per month will be payable every fortnight, the Treasury said.

Pubs and restaurants could be forced to close

Leaders in the North of England had previously criticised plans to close pubs and hospitality venues as part of a new system of coronavirus restrictions.

Earlier, the Labour leader of Gateshead Council, Martin Gannon, said he is opposed to a lockdown of hospitality venues and that current measures should be given time to work.

But northern leaders have complained they have not been consulted and said that more restrictions will lead to further "resistance and further confusion".

Mr Gannon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday: "I think new measures would be counter-productive.

"We had three different sets of regulations in 10 days which caused huge resistance and confusion.

"Our argument is that even with the mixed messaging, even with the confusion and frustration, the measures that are in at the moment are beginning to work.

"Help us to win confidence to the measures that are currently in, not bring in new measures and get even further resistance and further confusion."

Under the three-tier system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories, with areas in the highest level expected to face tough restrictions such as pubs closing.

Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he expected his city to be in the highest category and added: "I do believe that the measures that will be introduced will be a lockdown of public houses from Wednesday within the city of Liverpool and beyond the city of Liverpool in terms of the whole region.

"We do believe that there will be a concession to restaurants in terms of allowing restaurants to stay open until 10 o'clock."

Meanwhile, the leaders of West Yorkshire councils warned another lockdown will have a "devastating" effect on the town and city centres and regional economy.

In a joint letter to the Chancellor and health and housing secretaries on Friday, the leaders said that Mr Sunak's announcement that workers in businesses which are forced to close under the new restrictions will have two-thirds of their wages paid by the Government was "not enough".

They added: "Government must, for both levels two and three, provide a substantial economic package including grants and furlough - not just where businesses are mandated to close.

"In a three-level approach, there must be significantly more support available to businesses in areas that are in either level two or level three to avoid an even deeper economic catastrophe."

Talks are to continue over the weekend.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Government of not having any "anchors" in its economic approach to the coronavirus crisis.

Speaking at a Co-operative Party virtual conference, Sir Keir said on Saturday: "At the moment, amongst my concerns is that the Government hasn't really got any anchors. It's bobbing all over the place."

Sir Keir also told the Co-operative Party virtual conference: "Test, trace and isolate is critical.

"The Prime Minister said we would have a world-beating system - we didn't need that, we just need an effective one that works.

"'World beating' is just Johnson rhetoric.

"Getting a test quickly, getting the result quickly and then reaching the contacts so that self-isolation works - that's not working properly, which means that thousands and thousands of people are walking around today who should be in self-isolation.

"So, that bit needs to be fixed."

The Labour leader accused the Government of serial incompetence stating: "I think it is 13 or 14 U-turns now.

"If it was one or two, I think many people across the country, if the Government made a mistake and then U-turned, would say 'well, fair enough, we are dealing with a pandemic'.

"But when you have 12, 13, or 14 U-turns the only thing that can be read into that is serial incompetence," Sir Keir added.

A further 13,864 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK were reported on Friday, and 87 more deaths were confirmed of people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.

Nottingham has the highest rate in England, with 760.6 cases per 100,000 people - a huge jump from 158.3 per 100,000 in the seven days to September 29.

Knowsley has the second highest rate, which has leapt from 391.1 to 657.6 per 100,000, while Liverpool is in third place, where the rate has also increased sharply, from 419.0 to 599.9.

Several areas have seen huge jumps in their seven-day rates, including:

- Manchester (up from 421.6 to 524.7, with 2,901 new cases).

- Newcastle upon Tyne (up from 355.7 to 516.1, with 1,563 new cases).

- Exeter (up from 79.9 to 438.3, with 576 new cases).

- Sheffield (up from 171.2 to 426.8, with 2,496 new cases).

Twenty-four places now have rates higher than 300 amid a rapid increase in infections in the North and the Midlands.

Separate figures suggested coronavirus cases are doubling about twice as fast in the North West, Yorkshire and the West Midlands as for the whole of England.

In Scotland, pubs and licensed restaurants in five health board areas - Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Arran, Lothian, and Forth Valley - were forced to close for all but takeaway service for 16 days from 6pm on Friday.

While in North Wales, new coronavirus restrictions are being introduced in Bangor following a sharp rise in cases, the Welsh Government has announced.

From 6pm on Saturday, people will not be allowed to enter or leave the area without a "reasonable excuse" and can only meet people they do not live with outdoors, it said.

  Ghislaine Maxwell’s deposition about sordid sex life unsealed 
description: > 
  The Ghislaine Maxwell deposition about her sordid sex life has been released — after months of wrangling by her defense lawyers to keep it under wraps.The British socialite was deposed in April 2016 in connection to a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.US District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the release of the 418-page transcript from the seven-hour deposition in July, but Maxwell’s lawyers appealed the decision to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.The higher court upheld Preska’s ruling on Monday, but the parties have been squabbling over their proposed redactions.She was also charged with two counts of perjury for allegedly lying under oath about Epstein’s deviant sexual behavior in the 2016 deposition.

<div><p>The Ghislaine Maxwell deposition about her sordid sex life has been released &#8212; after months of <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/judge-wants-quick-unsealing-of-ghislaine-maxwell-sex-life-deposition/">wrangling by her defense</a> lawyers to keep it under wraps.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/article/who-is-ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-confidante/">British socialite</a> was deposed in April 2016 in connection to a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.</p>
<p>US District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the release of the 418-page transcript from the seven-hour deposition in July, but Maxwell&#8217;s lawyers appealed the decision to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The higher court upheld Preska&#8217;s ruling on Monday, but the parties have been squabbling over their proposed redactions.</p>
<p>Maxwell allegedly made statements in the interview about &#8220;consensual, intimate conduct with other adults&#8221; but a judge has said that she refused to answer many of the questions posed to her, according to court papers.</p>
<p>Epstein&#8217;s longtime confidante and one-time lover was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/02/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-associate-arrested/">arrested in July</a> on a six-count federal indictment for trafficking underage girls to be abused by her and the late financier.</p>
<p>She was also charged with two counts of perjury for allegedly lying under oath about Epstein&#8217;s deviant sexual behavior in the 2016 deposition.</p>

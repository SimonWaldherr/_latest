<div><p>Two Milwaukee women are accused of drugging 10 men they met while out drinking at Chicago bars &#8212; and robbing them of $85,000 in cash and other valuables while they were unconscious.</p>
<p>Cook County prosecutors said Tuesday that Tiana Trammel, 25, and Tjwana Rainey, 32, ran the scheme targeting drunken men from bars and clubs in Chicago&#8217;s River North section from late January through their arrest on Sunday, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-drugging-robbing-men-downtown-20201020-kvejre27ybhjtoufomfkncpde4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Chicago Tribune reported</a>.</p>
<p>The women, both of whom are mothers of young children, allegedly coaxed the men with invitations to another location where they gave them a drink from a small glass vial, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The victims would then black out, later awakening either in their own homes or on the side of a road without their wallets and valuables &#8212; but otherwise unhurt.</p>
<p>In total, Trammel and Rainey stole about $85,000 in cash, phones and jewelry, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The women also used stolen credit and debit cards at ATMs at Walmart and Target stores around Milwaukee, Assistant State&#8217;s Attorney Paul Kiefer told a judge.</p>
<p>They were arrested Sunday in Chicago after carrying a man from a downtown club to Trammel&#8217;s car, prosecutors said, adding that a tracker had been previously placed on her vehicle.</p>
<p>Surveillance video and license plate readers also captured Trammel&#8217;s movements, which &#8220;aligns with what happened to those victims,&#8221; Kiefer told a judge.</p>
<p>Trammel, who is pregnant, and Rainey, who works as a phlebotomist, have been charged with continuing a financial criminal enterprise and possession of a controlled substance. A judge set bail for Trammel at $55,000 and $45,000 for Rainey, the Chicago Tribune reported.</p>
<p>Drugging a person without their knowledge constitutes an &#8220;act of violence,&#8221; Judge Charles Beach II said during Tuesday&#8217;s bail hearing.</p>
<p>Neither woman has a significant criminal history, their attorneys told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, meanwhile, did not detail what substance the pair allegedly used to knock their victims out, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/10/20/21525439/women-charged-drugging-robbing-river-north" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Chicago Sun-Times reported</a>. Tests are being conducted to determine what chemicals were used, according to the Tribune.</p>
<p>Trammel and Rainey are reportedly due back in court on Nov. 4.</p>

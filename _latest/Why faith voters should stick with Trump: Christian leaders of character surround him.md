  Why faith voters should stick with Trump: Christian leaders of character surround him 
description: > 
  This year, Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson all came to events in Des Moines hosted by The FAMiLY Leader.These leaders of high character and conviction are in key positions of impact today because President Trump placed them there and because Americans voted for Trump the first time.It's true, President Trump seldom reflects the desired fruits of the Spirit.However, President Trump listened and made his case to the faith community, kept his promises to the faith community, and surrounded himself with key leaders of the faith community.That really does make a difference, and for me, it's more than enough to vote Trump in 2020.

Chaos is when businesses close and jobs are lost due to burdensome taxes and regulations. Chaos is when unborn children are prevented from breathing their first breath. Chaos is when protesters burn up our cities. Chaos is when rioters shout slurs at the police and soldiers who protect us. Chaos is when politicians threaten to pack the Supreme Court to get the rulings they want. &#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Fighting back:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/09/29/conservative-women-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-feminists-column/3564708001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Conservative women know what it's like to be mocked.

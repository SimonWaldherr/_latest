Demi Lovato is letting her voice be heard ahead of the 2020 election.

The pop singer, 28, debuted her politically-charged song "Commander in Chief" at the 2020 Billboard Music Awards Wednesday. Seated behind a piano, Lovato sang the power ballad that directly criticized President Donald Trump's leadership.

It marked her first performance since calling off her engagement to Max Ehrich in late September after two months.

Following her Billboard performance, Lovato dropped the music video for "Commander in Chief" on YouTube. Her visuals featured people from all walks of life singing her lyrics, including a Muslim man, a young Black child, a LBGTQ person and a woman using a wheelchair.

The music video ended with Lovato passionately singing "We're in a state of crisis, people are dying," as tears roll down her cheek.

"Commander in Chief" was co-created by music producer (and Billie Eilish's brother) Finneas O'Connell in an effort to encourage fans to make sure they have a plan for voting ahead of Election Day on Nov. 3.

"We are heading into the most important election of our lives," Lovato wrote Wednesday on Instagram ahead of her performance. "This song isn't about division. This is about finding answers from out (sic) sitting President. So please, debate and talk about voting. That's what this is all about."

The song takes a firm stance against the president, criticizing him for taking political action "for personal gain" and "spinning stories" while ignoring the truth. Lovato also seemingly references the novel coronavirus, repeatedly asking the president how it feels "to still be able to breathe."

"I'm not the only one / That's been affected and resented every story you've spun, and I'm a lucky one," Lovato sings. "'Cause there are people worse off that have suffered enough / Haven't they suffered enough?"

The song's cover art is a black-and-white photo of Lovato wearing a dark face mask that reads "VOTE."

As voter registration deadlines have drawn nearer – and, in some states, have already come to a close – celebrities have increasingly raised their voices to encourage fans to vote in the election: a move that doesn't always sit well with those who oppose their political views.

Lovato, in response to a comment on her Instagram criticizing her choice to take a political stance, made it clear she was more interested in voicing her beliefs as an American than pleasing everyone who listened to her music.

"I literally don't care if this ruins my career," she wrote Wednesday. "This isn't about that. My career isn't about that. I made a piece of art that stands for something I believe in. And I'm putting it out even at the risk of losing fans. I'll take integrity in my work over sales any day."

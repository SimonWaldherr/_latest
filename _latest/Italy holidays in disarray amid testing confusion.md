Holiday plans in Italy have been thrown into disarray, as the country introduces a new testing regime for British travellers.

The new rule means that British holidaymakers must prove they don’t have Covid-19 on entering the country. The negative test needs to have been taken within 72 hours of travel, or at an Italian airport on arrival.

However, there was confusion when it emerged that some Italian airports are only offering the testing service between nine and five, and the UK Government has confirmed travellers will not be able to use the NHS testing system to satisfy the requirement. Only those with Covid-19 symptoms can obtain a test.

This means holidaymakers will need to use a private PCR testing clinic, which have struggled to keep up with capacity in recent weeks.

Italy’s growing list of high-risk destinations already included Spain, Croatia, Greece and Malta, based on infection rates – the UK’s seven-day rate is now 136.8 per 100,000 people, compared to Italy’s 31.5.

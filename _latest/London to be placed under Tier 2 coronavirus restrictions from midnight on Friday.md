However, infections vary across the capital, and there has been some push to have alternatives including the suggestion of a "doughnut", which would protect central London, or that it be targeted at areas where rates are highest, mostly in East London.

It is thought that the practicalities of enforcing this meant it had been ruled out in favour of the city-wide approach, something which London councils and the Mayor Sadiq Khan backed.

Mr Khan told the London Assembly on Thursday morning: "Final conversations with ministers are ongoing around this as we meet - but I expect ministers to make an announcement to Parliament later today."

He said the decision was based on "expert public health and scientific advice" about what is necessary to save lives in the city.

"In addition to the restrictions already in place, this would mean different households in London not being allowed to mix indoors," he said.

"Nobody wants to see more restrictions - but this is deemed to be necessary in order to protect Londoners lives by myself, London council leaders and by ministers."

Alongside a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr Khan wrote on Twitter: "Urgent action is needed to protect Londoners and bring the virus under control in our city.

"Government must provide proper financial help to all businesses and vulnerable Londoners affected by restrictions, as well as local authorities who support them.

"It is essential that no one should be faced with added financial hardship through redundancy or a loss of earnings, and is able to access benefits or crisis support straight away should they need to.

"We also need an immediate increase in testing capacity so that London's testing rates can increase to the national average."

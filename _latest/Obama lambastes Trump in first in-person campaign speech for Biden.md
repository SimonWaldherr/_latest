<div><p>Former President Obama castigated President Trump as he hit the campaign trail for the first time in person Wednesday in Philadelphia to stump for his former vice president, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.</p><p>At a &#8220;drive-in rally&#8221; outside the south Philadelphia stadium that&#8217;s home to the Phillies baseball franchise, Obama urged Democratic voters not to get overconfident about recent polls showing Biden with a commanding national lead over Trump.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about the polls. There were a whole bunch of polls last time,&#8221; Obama said, referring to the 2016 campaign, in which many polls favored Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to win. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t work out. Because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent. Not this time. Not in this election.&#8221;</p><p>The Biden campaign&#8217;s recent deployment of Obama as a boisterous surrogate has introduced a dynamic into the presidential campaign that Trump can&#8217;t match. Four years into retirement from the White House, Obama, 59, remains <a class="link" href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/05/Fox_May-17-20-2020_Complete_National_Topline_May-21-Release.pdf" target="_blank">one of the nation&#8217;s most well-known and popular</a> political figures. Biden has also enjoyed the support of his strongest opponent from the Democratic primary, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Trump, by comparison, has never received any endorsement from his Republican predecessor in office, George W. Bush, and the party&#8217;s 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, was <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-02-05/mitt-romneys-full-speech-on-why-hes-voting-to-convict-trump" target="_blank">the only Republican senator</a> to cast a vote to convict Trump after he was impeached. Senate Republicans have even started <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-09/republican-candidates-begin-distancing-themselves-from-trump" target="_blank">distancing themselves from their party leader</a> in hopes of saving themselves from a possible November blowout.</p><p>In his Wednesday evening speech, Obama cast Biden as a clean break from the chaos of the Trump years. &#8220;Tweeting at the television doesn&#8217;t fix things. Making stuff up doesn&#8217;t make people&#8217;s lives better,&#8221; Obama said of Trump. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to put in the work. And, along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into a reality.&#8221;</p><p>Obama&#8217;s visit to Pennsylvania highlights the importance of the state that both Biden and Trump have prioritized. Philadelphia is a Democratic stronghold that Biden will need to carry the divided battleground state. Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008 and 2012, but Trump carried the state in 2016 over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, by just 44,000 votes.</p><p>In his first appearance of the day, at a roundtable event with Black local elected officials and community leaders, Obama, wearing a mask, emphasized the importance of Black voters forming coalitions with other voters to win elections. He especially stressed the importance of getting younger Black men, who turn out less frequently, to the polls.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the biggest tricks that&#8217;s perpetrated on the American people is this idea that the government is separate from you,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;The government&#8217;s us. Of, by and for the people. It wasn&#8217;t always for all of us, but the way it&#8217;s designed, it works based on who&#8217;s at the table. And if you do not vote, you are not at the table, then yes, stuff is done to you. If you&#8217;re at the table, then you&#8217;re part of the solution.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Obama also blasted the Trump administration&#8217;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately killed Black and brown Americans. </p><p>&#8220;The pandemic would have been tough for any president. We haven&#8217;t seen something like this for a hundred years,&#8221; Obama said. But he lambasted &#8220;incompetence and misinformation&#8221; and &#8220;the number of people who might not have died had we just done the basics.&#8221;</p><p>Obama had largely stayed away from publicly criticizing Trump for much of Trump&#8217;s presidency. But the former president has taken an increasingly public role in support of Biden, including giving <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-20/president-obama-speech-dnc-2020" target="_blank">a speech at the Democratic National Convention</a> in which he said, &#8220;Donald Trump hasn&#8217;t grown into the job because he can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

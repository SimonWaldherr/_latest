New Music Friday: The Top 10 Albums Out On Oct. 16

Black Thought — the rapper, MC for The Roots and freestyle genius — goes all-in on the latest installment of his stunning Streams of Thought trilogy. The new album, Streams of Thought Vol. 3: Cane and Abel, is a powerful treatise on the dehumanizing of Black people, white privilege, police violence and corruption, the scourge of social media (and more) — and how we've all become numb to this endless cycle of daily horrors. We open this week's show with the song "State Prisoner" from Streams of Thought Vol. 3 and talk about Black Thought's unflinching look at the state of things.

We've also got new music from the electronic duo Autechre, a debut solo album from The National's Matt Berninger, the highly anticipated debut full-length from an artist known as Beabadoobee and more. NPR Music contributor Christina Lee joins NPR Music's Marissa Lorusso, WXPN's John Morrison, NPR Music's Ann Powers and host Robin Hilton as they share their picks for the best new albums out on Oct. 16.

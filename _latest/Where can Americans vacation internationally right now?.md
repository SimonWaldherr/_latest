Scott Keyes is used to fielding questions about the best cheap flights around the world, but the queries he's getting from globetrotters as the coronavirus pandemic continues are more basic.

At the top of the list: Where can Americans travel internationally today?

"People are very curious to know the answer to that,'' the founder of travel deals website Scott's Cheap Fights said. "The answer to that is: not very many places. And the number seems to be going in the wrong direction.''

The good news: Some spots in the Caribbean and Mexico are welcoming guests again and drawing U.S. tourists as airlines resume flights and add new ones. Of the few Americans traveling, travel app Hopper says bookings to Puerto Rico, Mexico and the Dominican Republic topped the list for much of the summer.

But the welcome mat was quickly rolled back up in one popular destination, and other destinations have tightened their entry requirements.

The Bahamas, a popular destination off the coast of Florida, touted its reopening on July 1 before changing its mind a few weeks later due to an uptick in coronavirus cases in the United States. After retooling their plans, Bahamian officials now plan to reopen to tourists on Oct. 15. However, it will still require them to quarantine for 14 days until Nov. 1, when it will require negative COVID-19. test instead.

.

Bali scrapped its reopening plan altogether: After announcing it would reopen to foreign tourists on Sept. 11, the Indonesian island now says it won't do so until 2021.

More:6 things to keep in mind before you book an international trip during the pandemic

European countries have reopened their borders, but most are off-limits to U.S. vacationers due to the surge in coronavirus cases here. A couple that are welcoming U.S. visitors: Croatia and Turkey. Malta is accepting Americans, but not those coming directly from the United States. The U.S. is not included in its list of permitted nations; however, anyone is allowed to enter Malta after spending 14 days in one of the accepted countries.

Keep in mind that even though international travel is reopening and the U.S. State Department on Aug. 6 lifted a global travel advisory in place since March, there are still advisories galore for individual countries due to COVID-19. Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends against nonessential travel to much of the globe.

Travelers need to be aware, too, that countries have rapidly changing COVID-19 regulations. And attractions and other tourist businesses may or may not be open, so if you're itching for a getaway, make sure to thoroughly research the trip before booking and carefully check cancellation and change policies of airlines, hotels and vacation rentals.

Here's a list of popular spots that are welcoming U.S. tourists but notably not requiring a 14-day quarantine on arrival, because few travelers want to book a pricey international trip if they can't leave their hotel room or vacation rental.

Mexico

The land border between the U.S. and Mexico is closed to nonessential travel through at least Oct. 21, but tourists are free to fly to several destinations that have reopened. They include:

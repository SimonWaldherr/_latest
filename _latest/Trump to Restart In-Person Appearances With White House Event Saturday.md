The date of Trump's last negative test is still not known. His doctor said in a statement Thursday that he expects the president to be able to resume public engagements on Saturday â€“ 10 days after his diagnosis. As of late Friday afternoon, his doctor has not provided any further updates on the president's status.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally recommends a person who had coronavirus can resume being around others 10 days after symptom onset if they have been fever-free for 24 hours without the help of medication and other symptoms are improving. It does note, however, that patients with a severe case of the disease might need to wait up to 20 days after symptoms first appeared.

Trump, who was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center just days ago, needed supplemental oxygen on two occasions, according to his medical team.

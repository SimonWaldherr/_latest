A renowned Japanese jazz pianist has been robbed of his ability to play his instrument after he was attacked by eight teenagers at a train station in New York City.

Tadataka Unno, 40, who may never be able to play the piano again, was exiting the West 135th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue subway station in Harlem on September 27 when the suspects blocked the turnstiles and confronted him.

The musician attempted to walk around the group, but was yelled at and pushed from behind. He was eventually punched in the face and body.

According to a GoFundMe page set up on behalf of Unno by his friend Jerome Jennings, the assailants broke his right collar bone, and bruised his head and body.

According to Unno's wife, racial slurs were also yelled during the attack.

But police say no anti-Asian remarks were indicated in the report but the investigation is ongoing.

Unno was rushed to Harlem Hospital where he underwent surgery on his shoulder.

'I had no idea why I was shoved. One of them pointed at me and said, This guy just pushed me' to her peers. This was not true,' Unno told CNN.

'One of the others said, "She's pregnant," as if to imply that I had just attacked a pregnant person.'

Unno said: 'I might never play again.

'The trauma, both physical and mental, are severe, and I have no timeline for a full recovery.'

Unno said he is completely unable to use his right arm following the attack.

Jennings, an instructor at the Julliard School, and a good friend of Unno's says he is now suffering mentally and physically and is unable to play his instrument, which is his sole income.

'He's going to need some type of cushion to not worry about it, the medical bills, and he's going to need therapy,' Jennings told CBS Local.

On the GoFundMe page, he writes: 'My names is Jerome Jennings and I am a drummer, educator, and bandleader based out of Montclair, NJ.

According to a GoFundMe page (above) set up on behalf of Unno by his friend Jerome Jennings, the assailants broke his right collar bone, and bruised his head and body. In just over a week, the page has raised more than $141,000, superseding its initial target of $25,000

'I first met Tada in Japan and have known him and his wife for over 15 years. We have played together all over the world.

'We are both friends and colleagues. I have known Tada to be one of the kindest and gentlest souls.

'Four months ago Tada and his wife Sayaka welcomed a new baby into the world. Your donations will go towards emergency medical bills, physical therapy, rent, utilities, groceries, mental health support (therapy), taxis, moving expenses (in order to move to a neighborhood where they feel safer), and childcare.

'All contributions will go directly to Tadataka and his wife's joint bank account. Please give what you can. Thank you.'

In just over a week, the page has raised more than $141,000, superseding its initial target of $25,000.

Over the span of his career, Unno has played at the Kennedy Center, Village Vanguard, Dizzy's Club, and the Blue Note.

According to his website, he has been living in New York City since 2008.

'Thank you everyone for your prayers, love and tremendous support for Tadataka and Family,' the website reads.

As of Tuesday morning, no arrests have been made, according to the NYPD.

<div><p>Amazon reportedly raked in more than $10 billion during this week&#8217;s two-day Prime Day sale.</p>
<p>The record-breaking number represents a 45.2 percent increase over last year&#8217;s Prime Day event in July, according to a report by Digital Commerce 360.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/13/amazon-prime-day-wont-mess-with-your-mail-in-ballot/">Amazon Prime Day</a> sale was delayed by several months because of the pandemic, which put pressure on Amazon&#8217;s logistics and ability to deliver essential products to consumers let alone non-essential goods.</p>
<p>Still, the $10.4 billion in sales on Wednesday and Thursday may not have exceeded Amazon&#8217;s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales as it has during the past several years because of its close proximity to the holiday season, the retail data company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing that jumped out in Amazon&#8217;s press release discussing the results that might indicate it wasn&#8217;t as successful as previous events,&#8221; according to the report. &#8220;This year, Amazon didn&#8217;t mention that sales were higher than Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Prime Day was a winner for the company&#8217;s marketplace third party sellers, who brought in $3.5 billion in sales, a 60 percent increase over last year, according to Amazon.</p>
<p>Sales by third party sellers grew to 35 percent of Amazon&#8217;s sales during Prime Day up from 32 percent in 2019, according to Digital Commerce 360.</p>
<p>This year, Amazon did more to promote the small businesses on its marketplace funding a program that gave Prime members $10 to shop on any product during Prime Day if they spent at least $10 on items sold by marketplace sellers from Sept. 28 through Oct. 12. The promotion generated $900 million in marketplace sales, according to Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon announced another sales driver on Friday &#8212; Holiday Dash Deals &#8212; as part of a broad effort by all retailers to encourage shoppers to do their holiday shopping earlier this year to avoid a potential delivery crisis due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Shoppers will get daily discounts &#8212; from 20 percent to 50 percent off on select items &#8212; that expire within 24 hours.</p>

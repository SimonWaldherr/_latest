After President Donald Trump Trump sparred with NBC's town hall host Savannah Guthrie about his hesitancy to explicitly condemn white supremacy at the last debate, Guthrie asked him to condemn another group, which has been deemed dangerous by the FBI: QAnon.

Trump maintained that he didn’t know much about the group, other than that they are “very much against pedophilia.”

“I’ll tell you what I do know about, I know about antifa and I know about the radical left,” he said. He earlier said he has "denounced white supremacy for years."

Guthrie said to Trump that QAnon falsely alleges the existence of a satanic "deep state" apparatus that supports a child sex trafficking ring, but he said he couldn’t rely on her information to be fact. “I just don’t know about QAnon,” Trump said.

“You do know,” Guthrie responded.

“What I do hear about it is they are strongly against pedophilia, and I agree with that.”

“Why aren’t you asking me about antifa?” Trump pivoted, referring to the left-wing anti-fascist movement. “Why aren’t you asking Joe Biden questions about, why doesn’t he condemn antifa?”

Guthrie replied that she had Trump before her to ask questions, not Biden.

“Haha, so cute,” Trump shot back.

President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden faced off against each other on Thursday night, on opposite television channels instead of opposite sides of the stage— and with vastly different approaches.

Each participated in simultaneous nationally televised town halls on different networks on a night that was originally scheduled to feature the second presidential debate.

On NBC, Trump was pushed to address questions he's avoided, pressed on his health and finances, in sometimes testy fashion. On ABC, Biden delivered lengthy detailed responses in a policy-heavy discussion, continuing to dodge on court packing and regretting his support of the 1994 crime bill.

Trump was asked by moderator NBC "TODAY" anchor Savannah Guthrie whether he tested negative for the coronavirus before the first presidential debate, a timeline the White House has refused to clarify. He tested positive two days after the debate. Guthrie noted that the candidates were on "the honor system" to be tested beforehand.

"I probably did," Trump said. "Possibly I did, possibly I didn't," he said, adding he thought he likely tested negative either that day or the day before.

She also asked Trump whether he'd developed pneumonia after contracting the virus, a question his doctors had refused to answer. "No, but they said the lungs are little bit different, a little bit - perhaps infected," he said.

Trump also committed to a peaceful transition of power if he isn't re-elected.

“The answer is, yes I will, but I want it to be an honest election,” Trump told Guthrie. In June, Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace that he would "have to see" about a peaceful transfer.

In one testy exchange with Guthrie, the president refused to condemn the QAnon conspiracy movement, which pushes a baseless assertion that Trump is waging a secret war against a powerful cabal of satanic pedophile Democratic politicians, liberal celebrities and the "deep state."

"I know nothing about QAnon," he told Guthrie, but "I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard."

At times combative and argumentative with Guthrie, Trump calmly defended his record to the undecided voters who asked him questions and in a departure from his rallies, spent little time attacking Biden. One of his questioners even complimented his looks. "You're so handsome when you smile," she said, prompting a smile from the president.

Pushed about a New York Times report that Trump is on the hook for $421 million in debt that is set to come due after the election, the president declined to say who he owes the money too, and disputed the amount before appearing to confirm it. He called the massive sum is a “small amount.”

“In fact some of it I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money, $400 million dollars compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world.”

As for whether he owes money to foreign entities, he said, “I don't owe money to any of these sinister people.”

As for The Times report that he paid $750 in taxes the year he was running for president, Trump said, “It's a statutory number. I think it's a filing number you pay 750.”

''PRESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY'

In Philadelphia on ABC, a relaxed Biden gave long winded answers that focused on policy and his record.

Biden's first question was related to the coronavirus, and he used it to criticize Trump's leadership.

"It's a presidential responsibility to lead and he didn't do that, because in my view, he kept talking about the stock market," Biden said.

He spoke in depth about his economic plan. He was asked about how he'd energize young Black voters and talked about making systemic changes to American institutions from criminal justice to homeownership and education to early childhood learning to close the racial wealth gap.

Asked by moderator George Stephanopoulos if it was a mistake to support the 1994 crime bill, Biden said, "Yes it was." He added, "Things have changed drastically since then."

Asked if he still believes that "more cops mean less crime," Biden said, "Yes, if in fact they're involved in community policing and not jump squads."

Biden was again pushed about his position on court packing when asked about Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett - and again declined to answer, but acknowledged he's "not a fan" of the idea.

He said he will let voters know his full position depending on how the Senate handles Barrett’s confirmation, which he said puts the country's healthcare system in jeopardy.

In Miami, Trump touted his nominee, and said he didn't know how she'd vote on issues like Obamacare because he never asked her about it. Asked if he expected to vote in his favor on issues, he said he didn't know.

CANCELED DEBATE

The second presidential debate was canceled after Trump backed out because he objected to the Commission on Presidential Debates' decision to make the event a virtual debate. The CPD made the change after Trump tested positive for the coronavirus.

Biden has consistently led Trump in polls and the margin widened after Trump delivered a widely panned debate performance and then contracted Covid-19, increasing the pressure on the incumbent president to find a way to revive his flagging campaign.

The simultaneous town halls ignited criticism among some supporters of Biden, who called on NBC to reschedule the event with Trump, which had been scheduled after the vice president’s event.

More than 100 actors and directors involved in NBC Universal productions signed a petition calling for the townhall to be moved.

NBCUniversal News Group chairman Cesar Conde said the while the network shares the “frustration” of holding two events at the same time, the decision was “motivated only by fairness, not business considerations” because NBC had hosted a similar event with Biden on Oct. 5 at during the same 8 p.m. timeslot.

Both town hall venues had extra coronavirus-related safety measures in place.

The Trump event took place outdoors at the Pérez Art Museum in accordance with guidelines set forth by health officials and consistent with all government regulations. Guthrie and the president were supposed to be at least 12 feet apart from each other and the audience.

The audience was socially distanced and required to wear masks, answer a symptoms questionnaire and take a temperature check before entering the outdoor venue.

The Biden town hall at the National Constitution Center, was held in accordance with state and local government health and safety regulations, and guidelines set by health officials, according to ABC.

The debate the town halls are replacing was the first to be canceled since the advent of regular televised presidential debates in 1976. The debate, which had been originally scheduled to take place in Miami, was to be moderated by C-SPAN's Steve Scully, who was indefinitely suspended from the network on Thursday after he admitted to making up a claim that his Twitter account had been hacked.

The final presidential debate is still scheduled for Oct. 22nd in Nashville, with NBC News's Kristen Welker moderating. "I expect to be there," Biden told Stephanopoulos.

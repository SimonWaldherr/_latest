<p>Wales will go back into lockdown on Friday&#160;after the Welsh government decided on a two-week 'fire break' lockdown to curb rising Covid-19 rates.</p>
<p>Set to start at 6pm on October 23, the new restrictions will coincide with school half-term holidays.</p>
<p>All residents in Wales will be required to stay at home, with exceptions only for necessities such as food or medicine, or for those who have no option but to travel for work.</p>

<p>First Minister Mark Drakeford said the two-week period&#160;is "the shortest we can make it, but that means it will have to be sharp and deep to have the impact we need it to have on the coronavirus."</p>

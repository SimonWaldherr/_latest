US president Donald Trump has suggested he would return to rallies this weekend

Donald Trump has been given the all-clear to return to campaigning by his doctors after apparently recovering from the coronavirus and is set to give an in-person interview and undergo a “televised medical evaluation” on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show this evening, followed by a rally in Florida on Saturday night.

The president gave two phone interviews to Fox on Thursday, the second of which saw him insisting to host Sean Hannity that he was fully recovered from Covid-19 and “not contagious at all”, despite his voice being audibly hoarse and several worrying coughs erupting to break up his rants.

Trump sidestepped questions on whether he was still testing positive, speculating he might never have had the virus at all and otherwise was on characteristically meandering and vengeful form, attacking Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and warning California could soon have to ration its water supplies.

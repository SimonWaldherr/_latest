  Is it possible to design a Covid-proof house? Top-end developers think so - but it'll cost you

  As the rain sets in while swathes of the country endure a second lockdown, our attention will inevitably turn again to upgrading our homes – our sanctuaries – in coming months.In London’s super-prime property echelons, Covid-busting design is now at the forefront of wealthy home-owners’ minds, including virus-quashing “antechambers” the moment we enter our homes, and self-sanitising wardrobes that minimise the threat of viruses, says Charu Gandhi, head of Elicyon design studio.Once inside, people want a sense of “shedding” the outside world when they enter their private palaces, says Gandhi, and the layout of our entrance halls is undergoing a rethink.“The entrance to the home is almost split into two zones.The first is the precursor, a hygiene-focused antechamber that leads discreetly to the next zone, which is more akin to a typical entrance.”

<div><p>As the rain sets in while swathes of the country endure a second lockdown, our attention will inevitably turn again to upgrading our homes &#8211; our sanctuaries &#8211;&#160;in coming months.&#160;</p>
<p>In London&#8217;s super-prime property echelons, Covid-busting design is now at the forefront of wealthy home-owners&#8217; minds, including virus-quashing &#8220;antechambers&#8221; the moment we enter our homes, and self-sanitising wardrobes that minimise the threat of viruses, says Charu Gandhi, head of Elicyon design studio.&#160;</p>
<p>The gatekeeping, however, starts at the front door. A new AI thermal body temperature and facial recognition entry system from OKTO Technologies works on a &#8216;red for stop, green for go&#8217; basis, allowing only healthy, virus-free visitors to enter the building.&#160;</p>
<p>Once inside, people want a sense of &#8220;shedding&#8221; the outside world when they enter their private palaces, says Gandhi, and the layout of our entrance halls is undergoing a rethink.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to ensure there is a discreet wash basin for hands, somewhere to store shoes and coats before entering and, in larger properties, a dedicated space to receive packages and goods,&#8221; Gandhi comments. &#8220;The entrance to the home is almost split into two zones. The first is the precursor, a hygiene-focused antechamber that leads discreetly to the next zone, which is more akin to a typical entrance.&#8221;</p>

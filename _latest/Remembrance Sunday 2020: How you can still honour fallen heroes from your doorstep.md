 <p>     </p> <p>This will honour those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, while ensuring that everybody stays safe.</p> <p> Just as the country came together to clap for carers during the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> lockdown, it is hoped they will take to their doorsteps once more to ensure our fallen heroes are not forgotten.&#160; </p> <h3>Who is backing the campaign?</h3> <p> Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> led the support, saying: "The pandemic will not stop us from honouring the sacrifice and valour of our veterans, the bravest of the brave, the best of what it means to be British." </p> <p> Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a> is also backing the Mirror's campaign. He said: "Remembrance Sunday is our chance as a nation to stand together to remember the millions of people from across the United Kingdom, and from across the world, who sacrificed so much to keep us safe. </p> <p>"In normal times, we would be paying tribute to our armed forces at the Cenotaph or at events organised by the Royal British Legion.</p> <p>&#8220;This year we cannot do that &#8211; this year we cannot stand together.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>&#8220;But like The Mirror has said, we can still pay our respects by standing on our doorsteps at 11am on Remembrance Sunday to mark the two-minute silence. We can still remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and who we will never forget.&#8221;</p> <p> Westminster leader of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> Ian Blackford, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, DUP Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas have all also thrown their support behind the campaign. </p> <h3>Who will attend the Cenotaph service?</h3> <p>For the first time, the annual Cenotaph service will be closed to the public.</p>

   <p>It will go ahead with members of the Royal Family, representatives from the government, representatives from the Armed Forces, and other dignitaries.</p> <p>Some veterans will be invited to attend the service, which will be made Covid secure with strict social distancing measures.</p> <p>The ceremony will be broadcast live on BBC One, Sky and ITV, meaning people can watch safely from home.</p> <h3>Will local Remembrance Day events go ahead?</h3> <p>Remembrance Day events are exempt from the Covid rules that ban outdoor gatherings in Tier Three areas.&#160;</p> <p>Veterans, members of the armed forces and volunteers will be allowed to attend Remembrance events, as long as organisers put "reasonable measures" in place to lower the risk of transmission.</p></div>

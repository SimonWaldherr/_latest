<div><p>Lockdown measures have been loosening more and more&#160;over the past few weeks, with retailers, hotels, campsites,&#160;hairdressers and pubs finally reopening. To ensure staff and shoppers are kept safe, a host of guidelines have been put in place,&#160;which include maintaining social distancing, excellent hygiene levels and mandatory PPE where applicable. As such, face coverings are now&#160;compulsory in shops,&#160;enclosed spaces and on public transport.&#160;</p>
<p>For those who wear glasses however, wearing a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/face-mask-rules-uk-shops-exempt/">face mask</a> presents a niggly issue: steaming. If you&#8217;re accustomed to wearing specs regularly, you&#8217;ll know all too well how annoying it is to have them fog up from condensation while sipping a morning coffee or cooking over a hot stove, and face masks, sadly, will likely have that same effect.&#160;</p>
<p>When we wear a mask, our warm breath escapes out of the top of the fabric around your nose, and so landing on the cooler lens of your glasses creating condensation, and therefore, the dreaded fog. You&#8217;ll be pleased to note that there are a few ways to avoid it...</p>
<h3>What should I look for in a mask?&#160;</h3>
<p>The fit is everything when it comes to preventing steaming glasses. As well as this, even if your mask is medical-grade and made up of the best materials that filter air particles for the most effective protection, if the fit isn&#8217;t snug enough, the mask is redundant.&#160;</p>
<p>Look for masks with a fine wire over the nose bridge to ensure it sits flush against your skin. Adjustable straps that can be tightened to smooth out any gaps are ideal, as is a mask with elastic along the bottom under the chin, too.&#160;&#160;</p>

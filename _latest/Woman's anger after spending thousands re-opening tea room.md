 <p>     </p> <p> London and parts of Essex were moved from tier 1 to tier 2 lockdown from Saturday after a surge in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> cases.&#160; </p> <p>Natalie has called for more clarity from the Government moving forward but is determined to make her business venture work regardless.</p> <p>"Nobody said anything," she told the Mirror Online, referring to official guidance from Downing Street.</p> <p>"As a business owner for the last six months, I had to figure things out through the news or Internet - not that anything was really clear."</p> <p>She said much of her customer base is made up of retirees, school run mums and students from Chelmsford College - the majority of whom will no longer be able to come in their usual groups.</p>   <p>Natalie went on to say: "Even before we heard about the tier 2 there's still that worry, it's sort of you don't know how scared people are to go out.</p> <p>"Are we not going to have people coming?</p> <p>"And because we're a tea room and our customers are older there's that as well - a lot of older people don't want to go out, or they're shielding or they're being told to re-shield.</p> <p>"But, it's either that or you don't get an income."</p> <p>Natalie, who has lived in the area her whole life, said no-one seems to be clear about how the high alert measures will even be enforced.</p>   <p>"They can sit in a classroom with each other but can they sit in here with each other? I don't know," she said of college students.</p> <p>"Are we supposed to ask people as they walk through the door &#8211; 'do you live together?'</p> <p>"Do you have to check driving licences? I don't know. I live with my friend at the moment but if we were to go somewhere people would assume that we don't live together."</p> <p>Including Natalie and her mum, the tea room employs five people, with two of those still supported by the government furlough scheme, which ends later this month.</p> <p>Natalie said the furloughed staff are well aware they may not get their jobs back after this month.</p> <p>The new premises was found just weeks after the lease ended in the summer.</p> <p>"We found it in June and then we got the keys 12 weeks later," she explained.</p> <p>"It was just a blank canvas and took us six weeks - we had to build a kitchen and everything in there.</p> <p>"We opened two weeks ago on Saturday."</p> <p>Asked about how much money they had spent opening the new business premises, she said: "In the tens of thousands."</p> <p>"We had to take out a couple of loans for it. Luckily we have stuff from the old tea room.</p> <p>"We already got our hopes up thinking we would open when the garden centre opened.</p> <p>"We thought we were going to open in June. We had socially distanced our tables and got told we weren't allowed to open.</p> <p>"Now we've opened this one up we're told we can't have people mixing.</p> <p>"How long is it going to go on for? Are we going to have close?"</p> <p>Natalie said lots of the old tea room's regulars have been in since the re-launch, which has given her hope.</p> <p>"If we were a brand new business opening I think it would have been a different story, but because we had a customer base already it's not been too bad."</p> <p>Natalie said she's happy to deliver food to people's homes if they are given permission to operate as a takeaway, with the tea room also serving hot food.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>Referring to the pandemic, she added: "I think everybody is surprised about how long it's gone on for.</p> <p>"I think when we first heard the news and it was that 3-week lockdown [in March] I don't think anybody then thought we would still be having these problems in October.</p> <p>"If we go up to tier 3, like if everything closes completely, it's took us six months to be able to open somewhere and finally get back to work, so for this to happen is a bit rubbish really."</p></div>

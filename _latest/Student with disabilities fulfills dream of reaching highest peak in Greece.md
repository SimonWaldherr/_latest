<div><p>DRAMA, Greece &#8211; A Greek university student with disabilities has achieved her lifelong ambition of reaching the summit of Mount Olympus, Greece&#8217;s highest peak strapped to the back of a friend.</p>
<p>Eleftheria Tosiou, who has been wheelchair-bound all her life, was carried to the summit on Oct. 5 mainly by Marios Giannakou, a long-distance endurance runner who has already scaled the 2,917-metre high mountain about 50 times.</p>
<p>Two other friends helped carry Tosiou some of the way but Giannakou covered the most difficult stretches, including the final approach to the summit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The feelings were very intense,&#8221; said Tosiou, 22, who is a biology student and a fan of extreme sports. &#8220;I was happy, I was moved&#8230; In the end it was most intense when we came down and realized what we had done,&#8221; she said.</p>
 
<p>Tosiou and Giannakou, 28, both from the northern Greek town of Drama, met for the first time in September through a mutual friend and she told him of her dream.</p>
<p>With winter approaching, Giannakou, who has run ultramarathons and endurance races in places as diverse as the Arctic and the desert, had to move fast to assemble a small team before the onset of snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were many difficulties. It was a project that was taking place for the first time. We had to organize a big team of people,&#8221; said Giannakou, who carried Tosiou in a modified backpack.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;But the most difficult part was the psychological one. A man lost his life there a day before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scaling Mount Olympus, known in ancient Greece as the seat of the gods, is not for the faint-hearted. Its jagged peaks earned it the moniker &#8216;the throne of Zeus&#8217; and those who make the climb speak of its very steep inclines and slippery rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was some fear because there were cliffs to my front and to my back, but there was not real fear that we couldn&#8217;t make it,&#8221; Tosiou said.</p>
 
<p>The achievement drew the attention of Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis who congratulated both through a video call.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never done something more beautiful,&#8221; said Giannakou. &#8220;I think it has completed me as a person.&#8221;</p>

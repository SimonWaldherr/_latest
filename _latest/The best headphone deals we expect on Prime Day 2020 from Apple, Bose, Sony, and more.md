Amazon Prime Day 2020 is set to kick off on October 13 and will run through October 14. The massive sales event will feature lots of discounts on all kinds of products, including headphones.

A great pair of headphones can open you up to a whole new world of music-listening, movie-watching, and gaming. There are a ton of worthwhile headphones out there, but the best of them can often get expensive. Amazon Prime Day 2020 should be a great opportunity to find a variety of true wireless earbuds, over-ear headphones, and gaming headsets on sale.

Last year's Prime Day offered deals on a bunch of headphones, including various models from Apple, Sony, Bose, Beats, Jabra, HyperX, and more. It's likely that Prime Day 2020 will offer a similar assortment of discounts.

Below, we've detailed some headphones that are likely to be on sale for Prime Day 2020, along with current pricing and discounts you can find right now. For more Prime Day coverage, you can follow all the best Prime Day tech deals here.

Early Prime Day headphone deals

Amazon hasn't launched or announced any specific headphone deals yet, but the company is promising that customers can "save up to 30% on headphones from top brands" once Prime Day 2020 begins. We'll update this page with all the best headphone deals as they go live throughout the event.

Though there are no headphone deals yet, Amazon is currently offering an early deal on its Music Unlimited subscription service, which could be of interest to headphone shoppers looking for an affordable music streaming platform. Prime members who haven't signed up for Music Unlimited before can now get four months for just $1. The service usually costs $8 a month.

When is Prime Day?

Amazon Prime Day 2020 will be held on October 13 through October 14. Various deals on headphones are expected to be offered throughout the two-day sale, so check back for a complete breakdown when Prime Day starts.

To access Prime Day headphone deals during the event, you'll need to be an Amazon Prime subscriber. A Prime membership costs $13 per month or $120 annually. Amazon Prime subscriptions come with lots of perks and features, including free two-day shipping on tons of products, Prime video streaming access, and more.

If you're new to Amazon Prime, you can get a free 30-day trial when you sign up. This means that new members who subscribe now can try the service for free and take part in all the Prime Day deals next week.

What Prime Day headphone deals to expect

Prime Day 2020 is expected to feature deals on headphones of all types and sizes. We don't know what specific models will be discounted just yet, but we can anticipate some likely candidates based on last year's sale.

During Amazon's Prime Day event last year, various earbuds, over-ear headphones, wireless headphones, and gaming headsets were discounted, including sets from brands like Apple, Sony, Bose, Beats, Jabra, HyperX, and more. It's likely that Prime Day 2020 will offer a similar assortment of deals.

Apple's popular AirPods were among the items on sale last year, and it's possible that the newer AirPods Pro will be included for Prime Day 2020. Other popular earbuds, like Sony's WF-1000XM3, are also likely candidates since they've already seen frequent discounts throughout the year. In fact, the 1000Xm3 are $52 off their full price right now. This is a common sale price for this particular model, however, so a better deal could be offered on Prime Day.

More new headphone models that weren't available on Prime Day last year could make the cut this year as well. Bose has its new 700 noise-cancelling headphones and Sony has its new WH-1000XM4. With that said, it's more likely that Sony's previous-generation WH-1000XM3 could get discounted to help clear out older stock.

True wireless earbud deals we saw last year

True wireless headphones have gotten increasingly popular over the last few years. These convenient headphones feature a compact design with separate left and right buds that connect wirelessly and are completely free from cables.

Apple's AirPods are among the most popular earbuds on the market, and the standard versions with wired and wireless cases were discounted during last year's Prime Day event. Both of those models are actually on sale for even less right now, so it's possible a better deal could be offered once Prime Day 2020 begins. Meanwhile, the more advanced AirPods Pro weren't released in time for Prime Day last year, but they're on sale for a nice $30 discount right now.

Other earbuds from Bose and Jabra were also part of last year's Prime Day deals, so we're hoping that similar models from these brands and other companies will be discounted during this year's event.

Wireless headphone deals we saw last year

True wireless earbuds are popular for their portability, but not everyone needs headphones so small. A nice pair of over-ear or on-ear wireless headphones can be better fit for buyers who prioritize sound quality.

Wireless headphones from Beats, Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, Jabra, and Cowin were all on sale during last year's Prime Day event. The previous-generation Beats Solo3 were marked down to $140 so a similar discount on the new model is possible. Meanwhile, the Bose SoundLink II were $70 off their full price. Sony's WH-CH700N were just $90 on Prime Day last year, so new discounts on Sony headphones are also likely.

Wired headphone deals we saw last year

Wireless headphones have a ton to offer but, if you're an audiophile, then it's likely you prefer to keep the fidelity that wires bring. Non-audiophile wired headphones have some great things to offer, too â€” namely the fact that they're generally quite a bit cheaper than their wireless counterparts.

The limited edition blue version of Audio-Technica's ATH-M50x headphones were on sale for $99 on Prime Day last year. The blue model is no longer available, but a deal on other colors or similar headphones could be offered this year.

Another notable wired headphone deal offered last year was on Sennheiser's HD 599. These high-end headphones feature an open-back design which, while not ideal for noise isolation, provides impressive audio performance. The HD 599 were $100 on Prime Day last year, so a new deal on this model or other Sennheiser headphones could be in store for Prime Day 2020.

Gaming headset deals we saw last year

A reliable gaming headset can enhance your multiplayer experience, offering immersive audio and an integrated microphone for online voice chat. Last year's Prime Day event featured several deals on gaming headsets from companies like SteelSeries, Razer, and HyperX.

Most notably, the HyperX Cloud Stinger, our pick for the best budget headset, was just $40. Meanwhile, the SteelSeries Arctis 7 was marked down to $100. We're hoping for similar discounts on these models and other gaming headsets once Prime Day kicks off on October 13.

How to shop for headphones

Headphones are available in different sizes and styles to meet different performance needs and price points. Some buyers might prefer a model that emphasizes accurate sound quality, while others may opt for a pair that prioritizes portability.

Over-ear headphones are larger than other styles and feature earcups that cover your ears to create a seal. This style of headphone is a good fit for people who want the best audio performance and noise isolation. On-ear headphones are similar, but their earcups simply rest on your ear rather than create a seal over them. This allows on-ear models to be a bit more compact, but they're less ideal for blocking outside noise. Gaming headsets can be either over-ear or on-ear, but they usually add an integrated boom microphone for online voice chat.

Meanwhile, if portability is your main priority, earbuds are the best option since they feature separate buds designed to rest just outside or within your ear canal. True wireless models are even more convenient since they're completely free from cables.

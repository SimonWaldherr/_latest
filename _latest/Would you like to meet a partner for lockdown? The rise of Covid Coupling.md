I had a hunch it was happening, but hadn’t quite put it into words until, last weekend, I saw it confirmed in letters 10 feet high, on a huge, bright yellow hoarding advertising the dating app, Bumble: ‘It’s not just any old cuffing season’.

Cuffing season, for the uninitiated, is the autumn window when the nights begin drawing in and singletons cast their net for a candidate with whom to share a duvet through the dark days of winter. Cuffing’s not designed to be permanent – come spring, such seasonal couples might well cast off the cuffs to explore other entanglements unimpeded.

This year, however, with a second lockdown looming (or, for many, already under way) cuffing season is being dubbed coving season, due to anxious singles – particularly those who saw out the spring lockdown solo – frantically seeking partners to save them from stir-crazy solitude. There’s also, of course, a well documented correlation between times of great terror and frenzied sexual activity (see: the Blitz, 9/11, Hurricane Sandy); we’re simply not designed to be scared and single – it’s dating Darwinism.

I spent the first lockdown very single. And, while I made a good fist of keeping myself sane, I’d be lying if I told you those long, monotonous months in my own company (bar the rat that decided to move in with me briefly in May) didn’t get dull, repetitive and lonely. I briefly considered reconnecting with a hyper-local ex, who lives a 10-minute walk away, then remembered that he was awful. But the hunger for physical contact, partly to help distract from the existential dread, was real.

Pre-pandemic I’ve generally found partners in late night bars, at parties, on planes, at the gym. I’ve also never been a fan of app dating, which makes me behave bizarrely, hurling me into a destructively Pavlovian cycle. But, this year when life was suddenly devoid of late night bars, of parties, of planes, of the gym, I desperately craved new company and caved in and started online dating.

To my surprise, the men I struck up conversations with weren’t angling for a fast hook-up as they may normally have done; the risks of contracting Covid, coupled with a dramatic reduction in casual sexual opportunity, appears to have made fickle and flaky men significantly nicer.

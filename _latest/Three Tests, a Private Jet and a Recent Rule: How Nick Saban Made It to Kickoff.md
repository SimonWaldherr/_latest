  Three Tests, a Private Jet and a Recent Rule: How Nick Saban Made It to Kickoff 
description: > 
  A private jet, the crimson “A” of the University of Alabama painted on its tail, lifted off from Tuscaloosa, Ala., around daybreak Saturday with extraordinary cargo: cellular debris collected from the nose of Nick Saban, the football coach.Three days earlier, Saban had announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.Now, still in isolation hours before second-ranked Alabama was to play third-ranked Georgia, Saban knew the specimen aboard the plane was his diagnostic lifeline to the sideline.Hours after a final negative result — and with no small help from a rule change that Southeastern Conference leaders approved six days before the positive test that shocked Alabama — millions of people watched on television as Saban led the Crimson Tide to a 41-24 victory.And, more than seven months into the nation’s coronavirus crisis, access to testing remains inconsistent, except among America’s elite.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">A private jet, the crimson &#8220;A&#8221; of the University of Alabama painted on its tail, lifted off from Tuscaloosa, Ala., around daybreak Saturday with extraordinary cargo: cellular debris collected from the nose of Nick Saban, the football coach.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Three days earlier, Saban had announced that he had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-nick-saban-alabama.html" title="">tested positive for the coronavirus</a>. Now, still in isolation hours before second-ranked Alabama was to play third-ranked Georgia, Saban knew the specimen aboard the plane was his diagnostic lifeline to the sideline. If a laboratory in Mobile, Ala., reported that the sample was negative for the virus, Saban, who had asserted that he had no symptoms and had repeatedly tested negative after his initial result, would be allowed to leave isolation a week early and coach in the prime-time game.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">And so it was. Hours after a final negative result &#8212; and with no small help from a rule change that Southeastern Conference leaders approved six days before the positive test that shocked Alabama &#8212; millions of people watched on television as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/sports/ncaafootball/nick-saban-alabama-georgia-coronavirus.html" title="">Saban led the Crimson Tide</a> to a 41-24 victory.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The episode underscored two aspects of the response to the virus: Even the most rigorous tests &#8212; in this case a polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., widely considered the gold standard of infectious disease diagnostics &#8212; can falter. And, more than seven months into the nation&#8217;s coronavirus crisis, access to testing remains inconsistent, except among America&#8217;s elite.</p></div>

Why was it necessary?

On Monday morning the new measures were pre-empted with a briefing led by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer.

He warned it was of "concern" that coronavirus was "heating up" in more of England than a week ago, with infections spreading into more vulnerable age groups.

Prof Van-Tam said: “"This is a nationwide phenomenon now that rates are changing upwards across the UK."

He also warned that the virus was now spreading from younger age groups into those aged over 60.

"And this is again of significant concern... because of course the elderly suffer a much worse course with Covid-19, they are admitted to hospital for longer periods, and they are more difficult to save,” he said.

According to the latest data from Public Health England, the rate of infection among people aged 80 and above in the North West has risen from 40.5 to 72.8 per 100,000 in the space of the last four weeks.

<div><p>Instagram has agreed to measures to crack down on hidden advertising by so-called influencers on its photo and video platform, Britain&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority said Friday.</p>
<p>Influencers with thousands of followers can earn large fees from companies to promote a product on Instagram.</p>
<p>In what the CMA described as an important behavior shift by a major social media platform, Facebook Ireland, which operates Instagram in Britain, has committed to a package of changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will make it much harder for people to post an advert on Instagram without labeling it as such,&#8221; the CMA said in a statement.</p>
<p>Facebook said the company was pleased to be working with the CMA on its continued efforts to increase transparency on when people are paid to post content on Instagram.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also proud to be launching a program with MediaSmart to help educate young people about branded content and how to identify it,&#8221; Facebook added.</p>
<p>The CMA said it has been investigating concerns that too many influencers are posting content about businesses without making it clear <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/report-social-media-influencers-push-voting-misinformation/">they have been paid or received other incentives to do so</a>.</p>
<p>Influencers will have to confirm and disclose if they have received any incentives to promote a product or service.</p>
<p>Instagram will also use technology to spot when users might not have disclosed clearly that a post is an advertisement, the CMA said.</p>
<p>Last year 16 celebrities pledged <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/09/celebrity-nude-photos-and-video-pleas-to-vote-are-the-bane-of-the-election/">to clean up their act on social media</a> after CMA action, the watchdog added.</p>

<div><p>Army Spc. Vanessa Guill&#233;n is considered to have died &#8220;in the line of duty&#8221; &#8211; allowing her family to receive certain military benefits, Fort Hood said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This determination establishes that the Guill&#233;n family is entitled to a variety of Army benefits for Vanessa&#8217;s service to our nation. Typically these benefits include compensation to immediately help the family with expenses, funeral with full military honors, the Servicemembers&#8217; Group Life Insurance, and final pay and allowances,&#8221;<a href="https://forthoodpresscenter.com/army-informs-guillen-family-on-line-of-duty-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> it said Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Army conducts a line of duty determination for all Soldier deaths,&#8221; officials said in the statement announcing that Guill&#233;n&#8217;s family had been briefed about the results of the probe.</p>
<p>The Army recently announced <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/01/embattled-fort-hood-nixes-leadership-after-many-soldier-deaths/">changes in the leadership</a> at Fort Hood amid the probe into the killing of Guill&#233;n, who was allegedly bludgeoned by a fellow soldier after coming forward about being sexually harassed.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old was found dead on July 1 in a shallow grave near Leon River in Bell County, about 20 miles east of the base.</p>
 
<p>Authorities say another soldier, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/02/suspect-in-vanessa-guillen-disappearance-identified/">Spc. Aaron David Robinson</a>, bludgeoned her to death before killing himself.</p>
<p>Robinson&#8217;s civilian girlfriend, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/10/army-officials-reveal-new-details-in-vanessa-guillen-case/">Cecily Aguilar</a>, has admitted to investigators that he told her he&#8217;d bludgeoned Guill&#233;n to death with a hammer in the arms room on Aug. 22. He then enlisted Aguilar to help dismember the young soldier&#8217;s body and bury her remains.</p>
 
<p>Aguilar, 20, has been charged with three counts of conspiracy. She&#8217;s pleaded not guilty.</p>

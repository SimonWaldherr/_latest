The 10pm curfew has made going out for dinner feel as puritanical as Christmas lunch at Oliver Cromwell’s. Where’s the joy in scarfing down the cheeseboard and a digestif when you’re going to be home in time for the weather forecast and a biscuit?

The only civilised response to the new normal is to eat early – and the earlier the better. Ignore the PR guff flying around that six o’clock is the new 8pm. Let’s make midday the new midnight. For what could be more fortifying to mind and body than the press-pause-on-life pleasure of the long lunch?

As wellbeing gurus preaching work-life balance never tire of telling us, nobody does lunch quite like the French. Let’s gloss over the uncomfortable truth that food-loving France is the biggest market for McDonald’s outside the US.

To most Brits, French gastronomy will always be escargots and entrecôte, canard a l’orange and mousse au chocolat – pretty much everything you get at La Petite Maison but with the added bonus of a Provençal heritage which allows you to pretend you’re on a mini break without two weeks of house arrest on your return.

&#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Kershaw Tosses 6-Inning Gem</strong></p><p class="">The Dodgers ace found himself in trouble in the top of the first inning after the Rays put runners on first and second with one out following a Yandy Diaz single and a Randy Arozarena walk.</p><p class="">Rays cleanup hitter Hunter Renfroe, who sports a career .915 OPS against left-handers, then strolled to the plate.</p><p class="">The game could have pivoted one of two ways at that point: Either Renfroe (and the hitters behind him) could bury Kershaw and put him in a early hole, or the left-hander could wiggle his way out of a jam and wrest momentum back from the Rays.</p><p class="">The latter option happened and with relative ease: Kershaw set Renfroe down swinging on a 75 mph breaking ball before Manuel Margot tapped a ball back to the left-hander for an easy putout.</p><p class="">From that moment forward, Kershaw put on a masterclass in pitching, with his slider doing serious work, per ESPN's Jeff Passan:</p><p class="">Kershaw did hang a breaking ball against Kiermaier, who was responsible for the pitcher's only blemish from the second through sixth frames.</p><p id="br-ad-38153476" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Still, Kershaw retired 13 straight batters from his first-inning jam until the Kiermaier homer, and he then set down his final four batters before being pulled from the game at 78 pitches.</p><p class="">The left-hander could have gone longer, but manager Dave Roberts trusted his bullpen to preserve a seven-run lead and subsequently Kershaw's arm in advance of another potential World Series start.</p><p class="">Ultimately, Kershaw flummoxed Rays batters all night, and one stat from ESPN Stats &amp; Info proved this notion:</p><p class="">He also tied a few ex-postseason star pitchers in Curt Schilling and Josh Beckett in another category, per MLB Stats:</p><p class="">In conjunction with the Dodgers' run support, Kershaw cruised to victory and moved the team one step closer to securing its first World Series in 32 years.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Dodger Bats Get to Glasnow in 4-Run 5th</strong></p><p class="">Rays starter Tyler Glasnow nearly threw as many balls (54) as strikes (58), walked six and couldn't get out of the fifth inning.</p><p class="">It's fair to wonder whether Glasnow should have been given the opportunity to take the mound in the fifth: He threw 86 pitches through four innings and gave up two runs in the fourth off a Bellinger moonshot.</p><p class="">Plus, the Rays are historically known for their quick hooks. <a href="https://twitter.com/zachkram/status/1318735609784094724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zach Kram</a> of the Ringer pointed out that Glasnow's 112 pitches were the most by any Rays pitcher since 2008.&#160;Of note, manager Kevin Cash pulled starter Charlie Morton after just 66 pitches in Game 7 of this year's American League Championship Series despite the right-hander throwing 5.2 shutout innings until that point.</p><p id="br-ad-30625479" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">ESPN's Karl Ravech questioned leaving Glasnow in:</p><p class="">Glasnow walked Betts and Seager before punching out Justin Turner on a 98 mph fastball, but the two Dodgers runners stole second and third to get into scoring position.</p><p class="">A Max Muncy groundout led to an attempt at nabbing Betts out at home, but that effort proved futile. A Will Smith RBI single then ended Glasnow's night.</p><p class="">Tampa Bay couldn't limit the damage from there: RBI singles from Chris Taylor and Enrique Hernandez put L.A. up 6-1, and the Dodgers went up 8-1 off a Betts solo homer and a Muncy RBI double.</p><p class="">It's difficult to say whether the Rays could have pulled out a win had Cash gone to the 'pen earlier, as Tampa's bats were still largely quiet in a three-run effort. But the Rays dug themselves a deep hole in the middle inning that they could not climb out of before it was too late.</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>What's Next?</strong></p><p class="">Game 2 will take place Wednesday at 8:08 p.m. ET.

The Dallas Cowboys have allowed the most points through four weeks. In the transition to new defensive coordinator Mike Nolan, the unit could continue to struggle.

In the meantime, the Cowboys must outscore their opponents. For that, quarterback Dak Prescott needs maximum protection.

Head coach Mike McCarthy said left tackle Tyron Smith will undergo season-ending neck surgery (h/t ESPN's Adam Schefter). According to Jane Slater of NFL Network, starting right tackle La'el Collins underwent hip surgery, and he'll miss the remainder of the season.

Terence Steele isn't the answer at right tackle. According to Pro Football Focus, he's committed three penalties and allowed three sacks.

If the Cowboys intend to maintain a high-powered offense, they need reinforcement or potentially a fill-in starter at tackle.

Cleveland's Chris Hubbard lost his starting job to free-agent signing Jack Conklin over the offseason. In Week 2, Hubbard had a solid outing in place of Conklin, who sat because of finger and ankle ailments.

Hubbard went through a rough 2019, which prompted the Browns to upgrade the position, though he could serve as a decent short-term starter.

As an in-house option, second-year undrafted offensive tackle Brandon Knight could line up on the right, but he'll likely replace Smith on the left side as he did in Weeks 2 and 3. The Cowboys need to keep Steele in a backup role and can make sure of that with Hubbard. A fourth-rounder should get it done.

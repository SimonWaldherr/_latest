President Trump on Thursday night said he will attempt to hold a rally in Florida on Saturday in what could be his first public engagement since contracting the coronavirus.

“I think I’m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity.

The president added he’s eyeing another rally in Pennsylvania the following night.

“It’s incredible what’s going on. I feel so good,” Trump told Hannity.

Saturday will mark the tenth day since Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis — and the day the president’s doctor said he can likely return to “public engagements.”

“Today the President has completed his course of therapy for COVID-19 as prescribed by his team of physicians,” White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley said in a public memo released earlier Thursday.

“Saturday will be day 10 since Thursday’s diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the President’s safe return to public engagements at that time,” Conley wrote.

Trump, 74, received experimental “polyclonal antibodies” and oxygen at the White House last Friday after being diagnosed with the virus a day earlier.

The president was hospitalized three nights at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he received doses of the antiviral drug remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.

He was discharged from the hospital Monday.

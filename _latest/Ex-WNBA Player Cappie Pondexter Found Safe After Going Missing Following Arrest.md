Former WNBA All-Star Cappie Pondexter has been found after reportedly going missing following an arrest earlier this week on a battery charge.

Per Madeline Kenney of the Chicago Sun-Times, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson said Pondexter was released from custody Thursday after being arrested Tuesday.

Chuck Walton, a representative for Pondexter, initially told TMZ Sports she went missing after being released from custody but said she was found in Los Angeles in an update.

Lyndsey D'Arcangelo of The Athletic provided an update:

D'Arcangelo previously reported Pondexter "has been declared a missing person and there is an active investigation going on into her disappearance."

The WNBA Players Association tweeted a message urging anyone to provide information they might have about Pondexter:

Pondexter played for five different teams during her 13-year WNBA career from 2006-18. She was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2006 draft after a successful four-year college career at Rutgers.

Starting her career with the Phoenix Mercury, Pondexter won two championships with the team in 2007 and 2009. She was named MVP of the 2007 WNBA Finals after averaging 22 points and 5.6 assists in the five-game series against the Detroit Shock.

Pondexter also played for the New York Liberty, Chicago Sky and Indiana Fever. She was a seven-time All-Star, three-time All-WNBA First Team selection and was named one of the top 20 players in WNBA history as part of the league's 20th anniversary season in 2016.

In April 2019, Pondexter announced her retirement from the WNBA. She averaged 16.4 points, 3.8 assists and 3.7 rebounds in 416 career games.

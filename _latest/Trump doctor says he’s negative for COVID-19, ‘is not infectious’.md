President Trump survived COVID-19 and is no longer infectious, physician to the president Dr. Sean Conley said Monday in a public memo.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany released the memo 11 days after Trump’s diagnosis as he traveled to Florida for his first post-recovery campaign trip.

Trump “has tested NEGATIVE, on consecutive days, using the Abbott BinaxNOW antigen card,” Conley wrote.

The memo was released after Trump climbed the steps of Air Force One without a mask as he headed to Sanford, Fla., for a 7 pm rally.

Trump, who gave an 18 minute speech Saturday to a distant crowd from the White House balcony, is scheduled to host additional rallies Tuesday night in Pennsylvania and Wednesday night in Iowa as part of an intense campaign scramble ahead of the Nov. 3 election.

“It is important to note that this test was not used in isolation for the determination of the President’s current negative status,” Conley wrote in the memo.

“Repeatedly negative antigen tests, taken in context with additional clinical and laboratory data, including viral load, subgenomic RNC, and PCR cycle threshold measurements, as well as ongoing assessment of viral culture data, all indicate a lack of detectable viral replication,” Conley wrote.

“This comprehensive data, in concert with the CDC’s guidelines for the removal of transmission-based precautions, have informed our medical team’s assessment that the President is not infectious to others.”

The clean bill of health allows Trump to resume a busy public schedule. As in 2016, polls indicate he’s the underdog, trailing Democratic candidate Joe Biden in most swing-state and national surveys.

Trump, 74, received experimental “polyclonal antibodies” and oxygen at the White House before spending three nights at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Trump was discharged last Monday after receiving doses of the antiviral drug remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.

The White House and Conley have not released some details about Trump’s illness, including the last day he tested negative for the virus and the results of lung scans.

It came just before Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s spokesman <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Drew_Hammill/status/1318659655304941568?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gave an upbeat assessment</a> of talks on Tuesday between her and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, saying they had found &#8220;common ground as they move closer to an agreement.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi had said earlier on Tuesday that she was &#8220;optimistic&#8221; a deal could be reached with the Trump administration in the coming days. But Mr. McConnell&#8217;s remarks underscored the divisions among Republicans that have long hampered a compromise, and which have broken out into an extraordinarily open intraparty feud just two weeks before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Republicans are growing increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump and his team are too eager to reach a multitrillion-dollar agreement and are conceding far too much to the Democrats. They fear that a vote on any large bipartisan stimulus would force colleagues who are up for re-election into a difficult choice of defying the president or alienating their fiscally conservative base by embracing the big-spending bill he has demanded.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senate Republicans were also concerned that any vote on such a package could interfere with the Senate&#8217;s hasty timetable for confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court by early next week. Mr. McConnell said he told the White House he was particularly concerned a deal before then could inject unwanted unpredictability into the schedule, according to the Republicans, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a closed party luncheon.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell made it clear that he knew his counsel was likely to leak, making reference to the possibility that his remarks could appear in the news media, two of the Republicans said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A short time later, outside the hearing room where Republicans met privately, Mr. McConnell told reporters the Senate would consider a broad bipartisan stimulus deal if the White House and Democrats struck one. But he would not say if it would hold a vote before Election Day, and members of his leadership team have warned that Republican votes could be hard to come by in the chamber.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If a presidentially supported bill clears the House, at some point we&#8217;ll bring it to the floor,&#8221; he said, without elaborating on the timetable.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He made his comments around the same time that Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin were speaking by phone, in what Drew Hamill, Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s spokesman, described as a productive discussion that would continue on Wednesday. He said her target of reaching a deal by the end of the day had yielded progress.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Today&#8217;s deadline enabled the speaker and secretary to see that decisions could be reached and language could be exchanged, demonstrating that both sides are serious about finding a compromise,&#8221; Mr. Hammil <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Drew_Hammill/status/1318659655304941568" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Yet Mr. McConnell was pursuing a different track. He forced a test vote Tuesday afternoon on a narrow measure that would revive the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular small-business loan program. While Democrats support the program, most of them opposed the narrow bill, contending that a far broader package was needed. It received support from a majority of senators, 57-40, but fell short of the 60 votes that most major legislation needs to advance.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Nicholas Fandos</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="stocks-climb-in-turbulent-day-as-stimulus-talks-continue"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#stocks-climb-in-turbulent-day-as-stimulus-talks-continue">Stocks climb in turbulent day as stimulus talks continue.</a></h2><p class="css-17dprlf"></p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Stocks on Wall Street rose on Tuesday, though trading was turbulent as investors reacted to developments between Democrats and Republicans over a new economic stimulus package.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">After rising nearly 1.5 percent the S&amp;P 500 gave back much of those gains late in the afternoon to end about half a percent higher. Speaker Nancy Pelosi had set Tuesday as a deadline for reaching an agreement on a package, but earlier in the day she suggested that she might be willing to extend that timeline.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Investors have watched the on-again, off-again talks closely in recent weeks, holding out hope for government spending that would support jobless Americans, small businesses, industries that have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, and state and local governments.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Stocks had received an early afternoon lift, following Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s appearance on Bloomberg Television, during which she sounded optimistic notes on the possibility of striking a deal on additional stimulus before the election.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">But it was later reported that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, advised the White House not to strike a deal before Election Day.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">The odds remained long that Democrats and the Trump administration could enact a plan before the Nov. 3 election. If differences over funding levels and policy issues could be resolved, there are still Senate Republicans to contend with, who are unlikely to approve a spending package as large as the one under discussion.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">Shares of the big tech companies rose even as the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/business/us-economy-coronavirus/the-justice-department-filed-its-long-awaited-lawsuit-against-google" title="">Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit</a> against Google, accusing the company of maintaining an illegal monopoly over search and search advertising.

By using contracts to maintain its monopoly, the suit says, competition and innovation has suffered.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Google responded by describing the lawsuit as &#8220;deeply flawed.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This lawsuit would do nothing to help consumers,&#8221; the company <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement on its website. </a>&#8220;To the contrary, it would artificially prop up lower-quality search alternatives, raise phone prices, and make it harder for people to get the search services they want to use.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Attorney General William P. Barr, who was appointed by President Trump, has played an unusually active role in the investigation. He pushed career Justice Department attorneys to bring the case by the end of September, prompting pushback from lawyers who wanted more time and complained of political influence. Mr. Barr has spoken publicly about the inquiry for months and set tight deadlines for the prosecutors leading the effort.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The lawsuit may stretch on for years and could <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html" title="">set off a cascade of other antitrust lawsuits</a> from state attorneys general. About four dozen states and jurisdictions have conducted parallel investigations and are expected to bring separate complaints against the company&#8217;s grip on technology for online advertising.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A victory for the government could remake one of America&#8217;s most recognizable companies and the internet economy that it has helped define since it was founded by two Stanford University graduate students in 1998.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Google has long denied accusations of antitrust violations and is expected to fight the government&#8217;s efforts by using a global network of lawyers, economists and lobbyists. Alphabet, valued at $1.04 trillion and with cash reserves of $120 billion, has fought similar antitrust lawsuits in Europe.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-mccabe" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">David McCabe</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cecilia-kang" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Cecilia Kang</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/daisuke-wakabayashi" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="an-apple-google-deal-is-at-the-center-of-the-governments-suit"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#an-apple-google-deal-is-at-the-center-of-the-governments-suit">An Apple-Google deal is at the center of the government&#8217;s suit.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/19/business/19markets-brf-googleapple/merlin_176454930_68795b17-0a8a-48a1-8fa8-ffd72438e16a-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Patrick Semansky/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">One of the fronts in the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">Justice Department&#8217;s case against Google</a> is a 13-year-old agreement between Apple and Google that has evolved into a multibillion-dollar deal with enormous consequences for both companies and many of their rivals.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, Google was the device&#8217;s default search engine. In return, Google paid Apple a chunk of the ad revenue it collected from the millions of Google searches conducted on iPhones.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Today that arrangement covers all Apple devices, which now account for nearly half of all Google search traffic, according to the Justice Department&#8217;s lawsuit. As a result, Google pays Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion a year, according to the suit. That has made Apple and Google hugely reliant on one another, while edging out other search engines and, according to the U.S. government, protecting Google&#8217;s monopoly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;By paying Apple a portion of the monopoly rents extracted from advertisers, Google has aligned Apple&#8217;s financial incentives with its own and set the price of bidding for distribution extraordinarily high &#8212; in the billions,&#8221; the Justice Department said in its lawsuit.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With billions of dollars on the line, the partnership is critical to both companies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Google officials said they weren&#8217;t aware of the Justice Department&#8217;s &#8220;Code Red&#8221; allegation and that the company&#8217;s deal with Apple is no different than Coca-Cola paying a supermarket for prominent shelf space.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="heres-what-the-justice-department-had-to-say-about-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#heres-what-the-justice-department-had-to-say-about-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google">Here&#8217;s what the Justice Department had to say about its antitrust lawsuit against Google.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Deputy U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey A.

Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several left the case this summer.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Barr, a former telecom executive at Verizon who once argued an antitrust case before the Supreme Court, signaled that he would put the tech giants under new scrutiny at his confirmation hearing in early 2019.

Mr. Barr&#8217;s grip over the case tightened when the head of the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, recused himself from the investigation because he represented Google in its acquisition of the ad service DoubleClick in 2007.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a blog post, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/business/us-economy-coronavirus/google-responds-this-lawsuit-would-do-nothing-to-help-consumers" title="">Google called the lawsuit &#8220;deeply flawed&#8221;</a> and said that it would not help consumers.

Netflix attracted 2.2 million<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>new subscribers for the third quarter, about one million lower than what investors were expecting and short of the 2.5 million Netflix itself had forecast, the company reported Tuesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Netflix also said it expected a slowdown for the fourth quarter, with about six million new customers, again lower than the 6.6 million analysts were anticipating.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Chalk it up to the pandemic. Consumer interest in Netflix accelerated earlier in the year as households in lockdown streamed films and shows more than usual, giving the company a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/business/media/netflix-q1-2020-earnings-nflx.html" title="">record number of new subscribers</a>. Another way to think about it: The coronavirus spike ate into the third quarter&#8217;s results.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Netflix expects to close 2020 with a record number of new customers, about 34 million, giving it about 201 million subscribers around the world. The company doesn&#8217;t offer any guidance for U.S. subscribers but based on historical data, it could end up with 68 million by the end of the year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Here are the other highlights:</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Business is good.</strong> It&#8217;s just not as good as investors thought. The company reported that it made $790 million on $6.4 billion in revenue. Investors were looking for $967 million in earnings on $6.3 billion in sales. But the more telling figure is the number of customers Netflix expects in the fourth quarter (see above), which is below what investors were estimating. Shares fell about 6 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">&#8220;Free cash flow.&#8221;</strong> That&#8217;s the measure of how much money is going in (or out) the door.

But this year, the company has seen positive results, about $2.2 billion so far, partly because of the pandemic. As productions shuttered, Netflix held on to more of its cash. That is likely to change next year, when studio work is expected to ramp up. Netflix expects to burn through as much as $1 billion in 2021.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">What&#8217;s popular on Netflix?</strong> The company reported that &#8220;The Old Guard,&#8221; a film starring Charlize Theron and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, was the most watched title in the third quarter, with 78 million households watching. Another movie, &#8220;Enola Holmes,&#8221; starring Millie Bobby Brown, a star of &#8220;Stranger Things,&#8221; drew approximately 76 million households.

These and other acquisitions signal that oil and gas companies are looking for ways to cut costs because they do not anticipate a quick recovery in demand for their products, which tumbled this spring when the pandemic took hold.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Pioneer Natural Resources and Parsley have some of the most productive shale assets in the Permian, and have long been considered natural partners. Scott Sheffield, Pioneer&#8217;s chief executive, is the father of Bryan Sheffield, Parsley&#8217;s chairman. Parsley&#8217;s current chief executive, Matt Gallagher, is a former Pioneer executive.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The two companies control fields that are near each other, which should make it easier for them to cut costs.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Scott Sheffield said the combination would &#8220;transform the investing landscape by creating a company of unique scale and quality.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The total value of the deal is roughly $7.6 billion when Parsley&#8217;s debt is included.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Parsley&#8217;s share price closed up by more than 5 percent on Tuesday, while Pioneer&#8217;s shares closed down 4 percent.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Other recent deals in the oil industry include Chevron&#8217;s takeover of Noble Energy and Devon Energy&#8217;s proposed acquisition of WPX Energy.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Many of the deals involve companies that operate in and around the Permian, which became the world&#8217;s most productive oil field before the pandemic and has helped turn the United States into a major oil exporter. But many shale companies had problems turning a profit even before the spread of the coronavirus helped drive down oil prices to around $40 a barrel. By combining companies, executives are hoping to reduce drilling, transportation and labor costs.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/clifford-krauss" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="german-carmakers-report-unexpectedly-strong-profit-but-the-pandemic-still-threatens"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#german-carmakers-report-unexpectedly-strong-profit-but-the-pandemic-still-threatens">German carmakers report unexpectedly strong profit, but the pandemic still threatens.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Employees work at the Daimler production plant in Sindelfingen near Stuttgart, Germany." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/03/business/03MERCEDESprint2/merlin_176483466_2e565ce1-e20b-49f0-9f7b-e7d407d6d300-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Employees work at the Daimler production plant in Sindelfingen near Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Ralph Orlowski/Reuters</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The German auto industry is bouncing back strongly from the pandemic as customers make purchases they postponed earlier in the year, earnings reports by BMW and Daimler indicate.

Fliers leaving Heathrow Airport in London can get a rapid test for 80 pounds ($104). Starting Tuesday, people going to Hong Kong can take a pre-departure test to meet entry requirements there, the airport said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The service will initially be offered for four weeks and passengers must book it ahead of time. The tests will be done by private-sector nurses, with results expected within an hour.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Heathrow, Britain&#8217;s largest airport, has been urging the government to allow it to offer more testing, particularly to arrivals, in an effort to boost travel. Heathrow argues that on-site testing would limit the need for two-week quarantines for people arriving in Britain. Government ministers have disagreed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As an international hub, Heathrow Airport typically sees more than 80 million passengers a year. But during the pandemic, governments have introduced a range of travel restrictions, and passengers have been wary of venturing too far from home, causing overseas travel to plummet. The airport said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.heathrow.com/latest-news/testing-deadline-to-safeguard-jobs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1.2 million passengers</a> traveled through it in September, down 82 percent compared with 2019.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Heathrow hopes its new program could be the start of a more expansive testing regime in the airport. For now, the airport will offer a test known as LAMP, which is not as sensitive as PCR testing, used by the country&#8217;s national health service. PCR tests can detect active infections even before symptoms appear, though with a daylong turnaround. Heathrow plans to add antigen tests, another type of rapid testing, later.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The airport also said that travelers to Italy would be able to use the test, but Collinson, one of the companies administering the plan, said it was still in talks with the Italian government, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54604100" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the BBC reported</a>.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eshe-nelson" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Eshe Nelson</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabella-kwai" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="berkshire-hathaway-will-pay-4-1-million-to-settle-allegations-of-iran-sanctions-violations"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#berkshire-hathaway-will-pay-4-1-million-to-settle-allegations-of-iran-sanctions-violations">Berkshire Hathaway will pay $4.1 million to settle allegations of Iran sanctions violations.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">WASHINGTON &#8212; Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate owned by Warren Buffett, will pay $4.1 million to the Treasury Department to settle allegations that the company and one of its Turkish subsidiaries violated American sanctions against Iran, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20201020" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">department officials said Tuesday in a statement</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Treasury officials said that Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s Turkish subsidiary Iscar Kesici Takim Ticareti ve Imalati Limited Sirket, known as Iscar Turkey, allegedly sold 144 shipments of goods &#8212; including cutting tools and disposable inserts &#8212; from December 2012 to January 2016 to two intermediary companies knowing they would be resold in Iran.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The transactions, valued at $383,443, violated U.S. sanctions that prohibit American companies from doing business with Tehran. Treasury officials said that Iscar Turkey violated Berkshire&#8217;s compliance policies and also &#8220;took steps to obfuscate its dealings with Iran, including concealing these activities from Berkshire.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Iscar Turkey is a unit of IMC International Metalworking Cos., which is based in Israel. In 2006, Berkshire Hathaway bought 80 percent of IMC for $4 billion. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324766604578456593085294754" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In 2013</a>, it bought the remaining 20 percent for $2 billion.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Representatives from Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The settlement comes as part of the Trump administration&#8217;s effort to exert pressure on Iran, including reimposing sanctions and enforcing penalties on companies that do business with Tehran.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Earlier this month, the Treasury Department imposed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/iran-sanctions-banks-united-states.html" title="">sanctions on 18 Iranian banks</a>, effectively locking Iran out of the global financial system and further cratering its already collapsing economy.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Trump administration last month also unilaterally restored international economic penalties on Tehran that much of the rest of the world has refused to enforce.

Problems even spilled into the Treasury market, which is at the core of the United States and global financial systems, prompting the Fed to step in with large-scale bond purchases and a number of other market rescues to avert an even broader collapse.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;While central bank action succeeded in restoring market functioning, this support does not address the underlying vulnerabilities spotlighted by the Covid event,&#8221; Randal K. Quarles, the Fed&#8217;s vice chair for supervision, said in a speech on Tuesday. He noted that the crisis &#8220;revealed a banking system that withstood this shock quite well with limited official sector support, and a nonbank system that was significantly more fragile.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Nonbanks, often called shadow banks because they operate outside of the traditional regulatory system, are a catchall group of lenders, funds and intermediaries that play a critical role in global markets. They required extensive help from the Fed earlier this year to avert catastrophe as credit markets seized up and investors rushed to cash out, leaving companies struggling to roll over short-term debt and funds scrambling to meet redemptions.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Quarles said that the Financial Stability Board, a global group of regulators that he leads, will publish a report in November that will both diagnose what went wrong and highlight areas for potential reform.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We know already that work needs to be done to improve the resiliency of money market funds before the vulnerabilities in these funds amplify another shock,&#8221; Mr. Quarles said. Money market funds, where investors can park their savings to earn a slightly higher return, saw major outflows in spite of reforms following the 2008 financial crisis that were meant to prevent such runs.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Quarles said early analysis of the coronavirus-tied financial shock has already &#8220;revealed a number of issues that may have caused liquidity imbalances or propagated stress,&#8221; though questions about the funding that supports key government debt markets remain, including &#8220;the role of leveraged investors and dealer capacity to intermediate in these markets.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/business/economy/hedge-fund-bailout-dodd-frank.html" title="">unwinding of a highly leveraged and widely used hedge fund trade</a> centered on Treasury securities seems to have contributed to problems in March, based on some early analyses.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While the Fed generally approaches financial stability questions from the perspective of bank safety and soundness, Mr. Quarles made it clear in his speech that global overseers need to look further afield in the months ahead.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The interconnectedness of our financial system means that it is not enough to understand the vulnerabilities arising from the banking sector,&#8221; Mr. Quarles said Tuesday. &#8220;We must also understand vulnerabilities in the nonbank sector and how shocks are transmitted to or from the nonbank sector.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeanna-smialek" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p></div>

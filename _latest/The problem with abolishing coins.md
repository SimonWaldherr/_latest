  The problem with abolishing coins 
description: > 
  But coins could soon become a thing of the past – at least if various governments have their way.Campaigns to draw down production of new coins regularly crop up in countries across the globe.The latest is in the UK, whose Royal Mint said earlier this year that a surfeit of coins meant they wouldn’t be making any more £2 or 2p coins for the next decade.Canada stopped making one-cent coins in 2012, while Australia stopped producing new one- and two-cent coins way back in 1992.The Bahamas is the most recent country to stop production of its lowest denomination of coins, halting production on its one cent piece at the end of January 2020.

<div><p>Jack Stirling groans when he sees customers at his supermarket rooting around in their purses for spare change. &#8220;I totally enjoy it when people decide to &#8216;lighten&#8217; their wallets by dumping a whole load of coins on the counter,&#8221; jests the 21-year-old, who works in a supermarket in Australia.</p>
<p>Stirling generally works in his store&#8217;s express checkout lane, where customers buy 12 items or fewer. &#8220;Speed is really essential to make sure the line doesn&#8217;t build up beyond two or three people,&#8221; he says. And customers who meticulously count out change can slow down the process significantly. The supermarket worker prefers shoppers who use contactless credit or debit cards, simply tapping and going without much fuss.</p>
<p>A study by the National Association of Convenience Stores, an American trade body, estimates that counting out pennies can add <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/24/AR2006092400946.html">up to 2.5 seconds</a> to every cash transaction. That isn&#8217;t a significant amount in and of itself, but multiplied millions of times a day, it can have an impact on productivity.</p>
<p>But coins could soon become a thing of the past &#8211; at least if various governments have their way. Campaigns to draw down production of new coins regularly crop up in countries across the globe. The latest is in the UK, whose Royal Mint said earlier this year that a surfeit of coins meant they wouldn&#8217;t be making <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54196300">any more &#163;2 or 2p coins</a> for the next decade.</p>
<p>Canada <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/business/global/in-canada-the-pennys-time-to-shine-is-over.html">stopped making one-cent coins in 2012</a>, while Australia stopped producing new one- and two-cent coins way back in 1992. The Bahamas is the most recent country to stop production of its lowest denomination of coins, halting production on its one cent piece at the end of January 2020. From the end of the year, shoppers can&#8217;t use one cent coins there.</p></div>

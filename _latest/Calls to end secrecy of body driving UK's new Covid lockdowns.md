The Government must lift the secrecy surrounding the "opaque" body guiding the local lockdowns enforced on millions of people across the country, senior MPs and scientists have said.

Ministers have been urged to make public the advice given by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, a Â£9 billion body set up in May to lead the response to Covid-19.

Led by a senior spy, the JBC has never published details of its deliberations or any list of its key personnel.

Greg Clark, the chairman of the science and technology committee, said the public "deserve answers" on the JBC if the Government is to maintain trust in its decision-making.

"The transparency of the JBC is simply not good enough at the moment. Its role in the response to the pandemic is far too opaque, and that needs to change," he told The Telegraph. "These are important questions to which the public deserve answers."

Earlier this year, the Government was forced to publish the full membership of the Sage scientific committee and regular details of its advice to ministers after a row over transparency. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, later agreed it had been "an error" not to be more open with the public.

The JBC was formed to handle the surveillance of Covid-19 at a local level and consolidate the advice given to ministers.

It reports to Baroness Dido Harding, the chief of NHS Test and Trace, and holds responsibility for setting the national alert level as well as recommending action to contain outbreaks, including the closure of workplaces, pubs and restaurants.

Government sources insisted the body was largely staffed by civil servants, meaning it was "not appropriate" to release their identities.

John Drury, a professor of social psychology at the University of Sussex and a Sage sub-committee member, said the secrecy around the membership and decision making of the JBC was "baffling".

"I know academics and scientists are involved, much like Sage, and yet we don't know who they are or how they are coming up with their advice. It's not acceptable," Prof Drury said.

A Department of Health spokesman said: "The Joint Biosecurity Centre supports decision-making. It does not make the decisions on specific measures or restrictions. We have always sought to be as clear and transparent as possible, publishing a wide range of data and evidence about how the virus is spreading across the UK."

How concerns about secrecy surrounding JBC have grown

At the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in April, Boris Johnson pledged "maximum possible transparency" over the evidence behind Britain's lockdown.

Six months later, with the country facing a second wave of Covid-19, senior MPs and scientists believe that promise may have been broken.

Concerns have been raised over the secrecy surrounding the Joint Biosecurity Centre, whose advice to ministers is understood to have guided recent decisions on where to enforce controversial local lockdowns.

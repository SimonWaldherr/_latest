<p>Every now and again, an investor cracks opens a book that completely transforms their understanding of financial markets. Although not all texts may resonate, sometimes, buried deep within those pages lies a strategy, perspective, quip, or anecdote that spurs an epiphany &#8212; hopefully one that translates into dollar gains.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous example of this phenomenon in action can be pinned to Warren Buffett. Without Benjamin Graham's "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+intelligent+investor&amp;qid=1603133267&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3">The Intelligent Investor</a>" serving as his guide, it's hard to say if he'd have become the transformational investor we know today. You know, the one with an $80 billion-plus net worth.</p><p>But Buffett took Graham's ideas and ran with them. And today, he's doing the teaching.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/steven_kiel?lang=en">Steven Kiel</a>, the founder and portfolio manager of&#160;<a href="https://www.arquitos.com/">Arquitos Capital</a>, tells a similar tale. Once a markets novice, Kiel taught himself the in's and out's of investing by consuming books like "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Buffett-American-Capitalist-Roger-Lowenstein-ebook/dp/B00DPTL2F0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=R0FL80S3U9TM&amp;keywords=buffett+the+making+of+an+american+capitalist&amp;qid=1570122202&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=the+making+of+the+american+capita,digital-text,163&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=bisafetynet2-20"><strong>Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist</strong></a>" by Roger Lowenstein, "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Margin-Safety-Risk-Averse-Strategies-Thoughtful/dp/0887305105?tag=bisafetynet2-20"><strong>Margin of Safety</strong></a>" by Seth Klarman, and "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Can-Stock-Market-Genius/dp/0684840073/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2ZUKUYKH27K83&amp;keywords=you+can+be+a+stock+market+genius&amp;qid=1581448329&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=you+can+be+a+%2Cstripbooks%2C150&amp;sr=1-2&amp;tag=bisafetynet2-20"><strong>You Can Be a Stock Market Genius</strong></a>" by&#160;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/joel-greenblatt">Joel Greenblatt</a>.&#160;</p><p>Since his firm's inception in 2012, he's achieved 16.9% net annualized returns.

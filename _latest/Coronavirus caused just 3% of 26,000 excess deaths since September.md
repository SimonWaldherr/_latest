This is the equivalent of around 100 extra deaths each day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number, which is a surge of 43.6 per cent on the average for that time of year, includes fatalities of any cause, with Covid-19 only mentioned on 3.3 per cent of all the death certificates.&#160;Six out of 10 of those who died at home were aged over 70.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Deaths in private homes were nearly double the five-year average for between April 3 and May 7, when Britain was overwhelmed by the virus and have remained 'well above average' since March.&#160;Yet in hospitals and care homes the number of deaths slipped below average in June, once the first wave of Covid-19 had blown over. It has now risen slightly back up in care homes, but remains low in hospitals.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Statisticians said the change represented a 'redistribution' in where people die, arguing many ill patients would have been reluctant to go to hospital out of fear of catching Covid-19 or suffered disruptions to their usual NHS treatment because of the draconian lockdown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Heart disease was the biggest cause of the deaths, followed by cancers and dementia &#8211; it is normal for these to be the main killers. For comparison, the Government's official Covid-19 death toll stands at around 45,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts are not sure whether the statistics are necessarily bad &#8211; many people choose to die at home rather than in hospital &#8211; but warn people might have missed out on proper end-of-life care, which includes painkillers, and that some of the people may actually have been saved if they were in a hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tories today said the figures lay bare the 'other coronavirus death toll' and called for Number 10 to provide a cost-benefit analysis of lockdown measures. They must work out, the Conservative MPs said, how to balance rules so they protect people from Covid but don&#8217;t put patients off getting NHS care meaning they die from other illnesses.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fiona Carragher, the director of research and influencing at the Alzheimer's Society, said that the death toll from dementia alone &#8212; which rose by 75 per cent in women &#8212; revealed the impact of isolation, fear of coronavirus and suspension of health and social care services.&#160;</p><img id="i-595fd672bf11072e" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="906" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-595fd672bf11072e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/11/34566620-8854715-image-a-14_1603103879332.jpg" height="906" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-53ef941ccf354d21" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="762" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-53ef941ccf354d21" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/11/34566646-8854715-image-a-30_1603103944526.jpg" height="762" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-8dc197aa284bad66" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="771" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-8dc197aa284bad66" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/11/34566636-8854715-image-a-32_1603103950283.jpg" height="771" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-5d97d41f2ab4939d" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="525" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-5d97d41f2ab4939d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/11/34566642-8854715-image-a-17_1603103890674.jpg" height="525" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WHAT DID PEOPLE DIE OF AT HOME?&#160;</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">MALE DEATHS BETWEEN MARCH 14 AND SEP 11:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cause of death</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Deaths 2020&#160;</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Deaths average&#160;</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Heart disease</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lung cancer</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prostate cancer</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lung disease</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bowel cancer&#160;</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">8,300 (+26%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3,204 (+29%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2,299 (+53%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2,222 (+29%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,906 (+46%)</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">6,595</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2,484</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,498</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,728</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,303&#160;</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">FEMALE DEATHS BETWEEN MARCH 14 AND SEP 11:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cause of death</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Deaths 2020&#160;</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Deaths average</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Heart disease</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dementia</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lung cancer</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Breast cancer</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lung disease</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other&#160;</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">3,729 (21%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3,116 (75%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2,821 (40%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,903 (47%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,699 (23%)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,699&#160;(63%)</p> <p class="mol-para-with-font">3,091</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,781</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2,017</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,293</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,379</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1,042&#160;</p> <p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_1"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">'Usually around 300 people die each day in their homes in England and Wales,' said Cambridge University statistician Professor David Spiegelhalter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The latest ONS analysis confirms that even after the peak of the epidemic this has stayed at around 400 a day and shows no sign of declining &#8211; that's one-third extra, very few of which are from Covid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Non-Covid deaths in hospital have correspondingly declined, suggesting most of these deaths would normally have occurred in hospital, and people have either been reluctant to go, discouraged from attending, or the services have been disrupted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It is unclear how many of these lives could have been extended had they gone to hospital, for example among the 450 extra deaths from cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Crucially, the ONS data cannot tell us about the quality of these deaths, particularly in terms of the end-of-life care provided to the patients and the support for their families.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Steve Baker told MailOnline:&#160;&#8216;We have seen now clearly the other coronavirus death toll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;Dealing with this disease is a complex optimisation problem.

death at home for both sexes in England, the Office for National Statistics report showed.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In normal times in all settings, dementia is the biggest cause of death in the UK, but many people with the brain condition end up in care homes, while those with heart disease may still be able to live independently and are therefore more likely to die at

<div><p>One of the three Louisville cops involved in the botched raid that ended in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor said in a new interview that one of the things he would have done differently was to burst inside her apartment without giving her time to answer several knocks on the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expected that Breonna was going to be there by herself. That&#8217;s why we gave her so much time. And in my opinion that was a mistake,&#8221; Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, 47, who was wounded in the raid, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/breonna-taylor-now-attached-rest-life-sgt-jon/story?id=73713345&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221;</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would I have done differently, the answer to that is simple now that I&#8217;ve been thinking about it,&#8221; the 20-year veteran said. &#8220;Number one, we would have either served the no-knock warrant or we would have done the normal thing we do, which is five to 10 seconds.</p>
<p>&#8221;To not give people time to formulate a plan, not give people time to get their senses so they have an idea of what they&#8217;re doing. Because if that had happened &#8230; Breonna Taylor would be alive, 100 percent,&#8221; he added about the 26-year-old black EMT.</p>
<p>Mattingly, Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove stormed Taylor&#8217;s apartment while executing a no-knock warrant March 13 and opened fire, killing the woman while she slept.</p>
<p>Hankinson was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/23/breonna-taylor-ex-cop-indicted-by-kentucky-grand-jury-in-shooting-death/">charged with wanton endangerment</a> for shooting into her neighbor&#8217;s apartment and later fired. The others were cleared by a Kentucky grand jury of any criminal liability in Taylor&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, returned fire at the plainclothes cops, saying he did not know they were police officers. Charges against Walker were later dropped.</p>
<p>Police said officers believed Taylor&#8217;s ex-boyfriend Jamarcus Glover had been using her apartment to stash drugs and cash, but nothing was found.</p>
 
<p>Speaking publicly for the first time about the incident, Mattingly expressed empathy for Taylor&#8217;s family, saying deadly encounter is something all good cops dread.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel for her. I hurt for her mother and for her sisters,&#8221; Mattingly, a father of four and grandfather, said in the joint ABC News and Courier Journal interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just a passing &#8216;Oh, this is part of the job, we did it and move on.&#8217; It&#8217;s not like that. I mean Breonna Taylor is now attached to me for the rest of my life. And that&#8217;s not again, &#8216;Woe is me.&#8217; That&#8217;s me feeling for them,&#8221; Mattingly said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me having a heart and a soul, going as a parent, &#8216;How do you move on?&#8217; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t want to experience it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Mattingly said that on the fateful day he worked a full shift before volunteering to help other narcotics officers who had been investigating Glover for alleged drug trafficking.</p>
<p>He recounted that he and several of his fellow officers were told during a briefing that Glover would be at another location on the list of warrants being served across the city at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wanted to do the right thing and they said, &#8216;Give her time to come to the door,'&#8221; Mattingly said, adding that he and the other officers had no clue that Walker would be inside and armed with a licensed pistol.</p>
<p>Walker and 11 other witnesses have claimed they didn&#8217;t hear the officers announce themselves before they burst inside. He said he fired the gun because he thought the cops were intruders.</p>
<p>Mattingly said that as his team arrived, a neighbor emerged from his apartment, began arguing with them and engaged in an expletive-laden verbal dispute with Hankison.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember him saying at one point, &#8216;She&#8217;s a good girl, leave her alone&#8217; or something to that effect,&#8221; Mattingly said. &#8220;Finally, I looked at Brett and said, &#8216;Leave that alone and pay attention to what we&#8217;re doing.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattingly recalled banging on Taylor&#8217;s door, but not announcing immediately that they were police.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we get up, I remember banging on the door, it&#8217;s open hand, hard smack, bam, bam, bam, bam. First time, didn&#8217;t announce. Just hoping she would come to the door,&#8221; he said, adding that second time they banged on the door, they repeatedly shouted, &#8216;Police, search warrant!&#8221;</p>
 
<p>When no one answered, he continued, they rammed the door open and he saw two figures at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I turned the corner, my eyes went straight to the barrel of this gun. I could see the tip of it. And my eyes just focused in on it as soon as I saw it,&#8221; Mattingly said.</p>
<p>Describing the encounter, which &#8220;happened in milliseconds,&#8221; Mattingly said he heard a shot and felt a burning sensation in his leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I felt the smack on my leg and the heat, I &#8212; boom, boom &#8212; returned four shots, four shots,&#8221; Mattingly said, adding that he fired two more rounds as the gunman ran into a bedroom.</p>
<p>Ballistics tests have determined that Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Taylor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reached down and felt my leg. I could feel a handful of blood and the heat &#8212; I thought my femoral artery. I said I can&#8217;t stand up because I&#8217;m going to pump the blood out if I keep pushing forward,&#8221; Mattingly said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember I scooted back and sat on my bottom and I scooted my gun out for some reason. I let go of it. Then I thought real quick, &#8216;What am I doing? I can&#8217;t let go of my gun.&#8217; I grabbed my gun and I pulled it back in and I yelled, I said, &#8216;Man, I got shot in my femoral.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer said he managed to hobble out of the apartment and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Asked how he felt when he heard Taylor was dead, Mattingly said, &#8220;It was tragic. It&#8217;s horrible. Again, that&#8217;s a situation that you dread, that you pray never happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor&#8217;s family filed a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/15/louisville-settles-breonna-taylors-wrongful-death-lawsuit/">wrongful death lawsuit</a> against the city that was ultimately settled for $12 million. The city has admitted no wrongdoing in the incident, but agreed to institute police reforms.</p>
<p>Mattingly, who is white, insisted Taylor&#8217;s death had nothing to do with her race.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not relatable to George Floyd. This is nothing like that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not Ahmaud Arbery. It&#8217;s nothing like it. These are two totally different types of incidences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattingly said his family has received multiple death threats, including one in which someone threatened to kidnap his son and torture him.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they started personally getting the death threats, as a father you can imagine how that would feel. When your daughters are getting threatened &#8212; I mean, it just makes you feel helpless, number one, and angry at the same time because here you feel like you were trying to help the city,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent 20 years giving my time, blood, my energy trying to help the city that I grew up in, that I love,&#8221; Mattingly said. &#8220;And now when something tragic like this happens, now your family is the one that everybody wants to come after.&#8221;</p>

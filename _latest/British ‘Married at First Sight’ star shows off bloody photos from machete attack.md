He starred in “Married at First Sight” but this British reality TV star looked a fright after he was attacked in a home invasion robbery, newly released images show.

David Pugh, 56, was shirtless and covered in blood from his forehead to his waist after the bizarre attack left him looking like a victim in a horror movie.

The salesman, who appeared in the show about instant marriages this month, used his knowledge of Krav Maga martial arts to fight back against the five machete-wielding thugs who broke into his Catherine-de-Barnes, England, home in Feb. 2018, the Sun reported.

“I got woken up at three in the morning with the sound of broken glass and doors being kicked in,” he said. “It became an out-and-out battle in my house for about 10 minutes.”

Pugh said his “martial arts training just kicked in.”

“I wasn’t being brave. I was very lucky – there were golf clubs, machetes, table legs flying.”

Warning: Graphic photos

The burglars, who also injured Pugh’s puppy Zeus, finally left his home empty-handed, Pugh said.

Pugh apparently released the photos after gaining fame on “Married at First Sight” recently.

He married a woman named Shareen on the show but had split from her by the time the show aired.

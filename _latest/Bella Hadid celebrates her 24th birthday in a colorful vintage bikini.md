Bella Hadid still managed to party it up on her birthday despite the pandemic.

To celebrate turning 24 on Friday, the mega-model soaked up some sun with her friend Devon Carlson, clad in a cool and colorful vintage bikini from Eclectic Heartz accessorized with armfuls of Jennifer Fisher bangles, along with layered gold necklaces and pink sunglasses.

Her halter-neck swimsuit features a tie front, a psychedelic pink, blue and yellow print and hipster-style brown bottoms.

Wildflower Cases co-founder Carlson, 26, coordinated in similar aughts-inspired fashion, wearing a floral Frankies Bikinis top ($70) and bottom ($80) with orange-tinted shades, giant gold hoop earrings and a pink bedazzled claw clip.

‚ÄúA few Bday elixirs,‚Äù Hadid captioned her shots of the pair drinking on a dock.

Ahead of her big day, the catwalker and a few friends jetted off on a balloon-filled private plane for a girls‚Äô getaway.

‚ÄúOh gosh I feel just really lucky. I usually cancel any kind of big birthday celebration so this year I just wanted to take my beautiful friends on an adventure that was absolutely non refundable,‚Äù Hadid wrote.

A British woman was arrested at a London airport with millions in cash rolled up in her suitcases — the largest single money seizure this year, authorities said.

The cash — nearly $2.5 million in neat rolls of British pounds — was scattered over five suitcases as Tara Hanlon, 30, checked in for a flight to Dubai at Heathrow Airport, according to a report in the Sun newspaper.

Hanlon was charged with money laundering.

“This is the largest individual cash seizure at the border so far in 2020 and I am delighted with the efforts of Border Force officers,” said Chris Philip, minister for immigration compliance and the courts. “Preventing the export of undeclared cash from the UK is a vital step in clamping down on organized criminal gangs.”

A 28-year-old woman was arrested at the same time and released under investigation, the newspaper reported.

<p>This year, the holiday shopping season has started earlier and business owners face new challenges as consumer habits will be drastically different. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-prepare-your-retail-business-for-holiday-shopping-season-2020-10">Customers anticipate shopping online more</a>, avoiding crowds, and making fewer in-store trips.</p><p>The pandemic triggered a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-coo-harley-finkelstein-entrepreneurship-ecommerce-start-business-2020-9">surge in ecommerce</a> and email marketing will be an important tool for messaging and promotions through the holiday season. But it's a highly competitive arena &#8212; getting customers top open your email is half the battle.</p><p>A low open rate is one of the main threats business owners face when trying to boost sales through email, said e-commerce founder Adii Pienaar. "If someone doesn't open an email, they're not going to take any further action," he told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>Pienaar is the vice president of commerce product strategy at email marketing company <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/products/cm-commerce/">CM Commerce</a> and he founded two companies. His first company, WooThemes, founded in 2007, sold website design and themes for e-commerce brands. His second company, Conversio, founded in 2014, was a marketing dashboard for e-commerce brands. Conversio was acquired by Campaign Monitor and rebranded as CM Commerce.&#160;</p><p>Successful email campaigns should follow a "one action rule," he said. This establishes brand identity the minute a customer opens an email and prompts them to engage. Small businesses can do this by announcing a new product or sharing a link with customers via email, he said. These emails start with company branding at the top, have a striking image to peak interest, contain descriptive copy, and end with a call to action.</p><p>Pienaar suggested segmenting customers based on level of engagement. Customers who have visited the website but never purchased should receive different emails than customers who have purchased before. For example, customers shouldn't receive emails promoting a product they've already purchased, he said.</p><p>Businesses should engage customers with both automated emails, like abandoned-cart messages, or scheduled one-off emails, like newsletters. Pienaar shared six email templates small businesses can use to stay top of mind for customers during the holiday season.&#160;</p>

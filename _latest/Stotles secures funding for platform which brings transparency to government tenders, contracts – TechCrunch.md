<div><p id="speakable-summary">The public sector usually publishes its business opportunities in the form of &#8216;tenders,&#8217; to increase transparency to the public. However, this data is scattered, and larger businesses have access to more information, giving them opportunities to grab contracts before official tenders are released. We have seen the controversy around UK government contracts going to a number of private consultants who have <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/government-legal-case-coronavirus-private-contracts-711916">questionable</a> prior experience in the issues they are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/16/uk-government-spending-on-covid-consultancy-contracts-rises-to-pounds-175m-investigation">winning contracts on</a>.</p>
<p>And public-to-private sector business makes up 14% of global GDP, and even a 1% improvement could save &#8364;20B for taxpayers per year, according to the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-commission" target="_blank">European Commission </a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stotles">Stotles</a> is a new UK startup technology that turns fragmented public sector data &#8212; such as spending, tenders, contracts, meeting minutes, or news releases &#8212; into a clearer view of the market, and extracts relevant early signals about potential opportunities.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>

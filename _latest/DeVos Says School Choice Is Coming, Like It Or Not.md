  DeVos Says School Choice Is Coming, Like It Or Not 
description: > 
  With President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence heightening their calls for school choice on the campaign trail, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos delivered the fullest picture of what that might entail and predicted more choice is inevitable whether or not Trump wins his reelection bid."Many in Washington think that because of their power there, they can make decisions for parents everywhere," DeVos said Monday at Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school in Michigan."School choice is not a matter of if, it's a matter of when."School choice is an ambiguous, one-size-fits-all term used to characterize everything from charter schools to programs like tax credit scholarships and education savings accounts that help families afford private school tuition.But the secretary's speech stretched well beyond school choice, mirroring much of the contentious rhetoric the president uses during campaign rallies.

<div><p>With President <a href="https://www.usnews.com/elections/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> and Vice President <a href="https://www.usnews.com/elections/mike-pence">Mike Pence</a> heightening their calls for school choice on the campaign trail, Education Secretary <a href="//www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-01-17/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-betsy-devos">Betsy DeVos</a> delivered the fullest picture of what that might entail and predicted more choice is inevitable whether or not Trump wins his reelection bid.</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>"Many in Washington think that because of their power there, they can make decisions for parents everywhere," DeVos said Monday at Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school in Michigan. "In that troubling scenario, the school building replaces the home, the child becomes a pawn, and the state replaces the family."</p><p>In what was one of the most political speeches of her tenure, DeVos focused on the philosophy and life of Abraham Kuyper, a Dutch pastor and politician who is largely responsible for allowing public dollars to fund parochial schools in Holland, where the secretary traces her ancestry.</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on the 2020 Election</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/e122dd2/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fdb%2F15%2F841be3fb4587a8ad9b19842d1e3c%2F20201016edptc-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>"Let me suggest we could fix education for so many children in America if we 'go Dutch,'" DeVos said. "School choice is not a matter of if, it's a matter of when."</p><p>School choice is an ambiguous, one-size-fits-all term used to characterize everything from charter schools to programs like tax credit scholarships and education savings accounts that help families afford private school tuition. The Associated Press recommends journalists not use the term because of how nondescript it is, which is one of the reasons why using it might be working to the Trump administration's advantage.</p><p>The idea of school choice has long been heralded by Republicans as a way to give children trapped in failing school systems different education opportunities and criticized in equal measure by Democrats for starving traditional public schools of funding &#8211; though support exists among some Democrats for options that allow families to tap into various public school options.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Some polling, however, indicates that the White House message on school choice is resonating with a broader swath of voters than ever because of the toll the pandemic has taken on schools and could play a key role in convincing conservative voters to stick with the president.</p><p>Nearly 40% of parents reported disenrolling their children from the K-12 school they were originally set to attend this year in response to school reopening plans, according to an online survey of more than 8,000 parents taken Aug. 20-23 by the data and analytics firm Civis. </p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>"At the end of the day, we want parents to have the freedom, the choices, and the funds to make the best decisions for their children," DeVos said. "The 'Washington knows best' crowd really loses their minds over that."</p><p>But the secretary's speech stretched well beyond school choice, mirroring much of the contentious rhetoric the president uses during campaign rallies.</p><p>[ <b>MORE</b>: <a href="https://usafacts.org/voter-center?utm_source=usnews&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=2020&amp;utm_content=bracket" rel="nofollow">Compare candidates and issues in the 2020 Voter Center</a> ]</p><p>"Too many today &#8211; especially among our rising generation &#8211; don't seem to understand the dangers of such a view," DeVos said about the idea that the government plays an important and necessary role in things like education. "They somehow have come to believe that socialism is the cure, not the deadly disease it really is."</p><p>She continued: "Tragically, it's because no one has taught them differently. And worse, some have been indoctrinated to believe not in themselves, but in government."</p><p>The sweeping, alarmist warnings come just two weeks ahead of a contentious election in which polls show the president trailing his challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden. Much of Trump's last-ditch efforts have focused on portraying Biden and his vice presidential running mate Kamala Harris as socialist and communist politicians who will wreak havoc on the economy and the sanctity of the American family. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"The unholy mob thinks our economies need redistributing. It thinks our Constitution needs rewriting. It thinks our families need restructuring," she continued. "That's taken right from the old Marxist playbook."</p><p>DeVos also lamented over the state of politics in the U.S., painting a picture of an electorate in despair and overwhelmed by a liberal agenda that has silenced competing narratives. </p><p>And she slammed Facebook and Twitter as "modern town squares" where "one can't publicly express a conservative view without inviting scathing rebuke, or worse, censorship."</p><p>As the president has been doing on the campaign trail, DeVos also spoke directly to mothers, pointing to attacks on Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett's "big" family &#8211; "as if raising seven children is something to be embarrassed by, or worse, ashamed of," DeVos said.</p><p>"Ultimately, Kuyper said that 'arrows do not exist simply to be kept in the quiver; at some point they need to be placed on the bowstring,' DeVos said. "I know some might shrink from that metaphor, but moms know what I mean. We know what to do with an arrow when our family is under attack."<br></p></div>

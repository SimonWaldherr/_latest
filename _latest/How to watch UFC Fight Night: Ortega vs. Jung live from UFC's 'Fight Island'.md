In the interim, Ortega was accused of attacking Jung's friend and translator Jay Park while they were spectating at UFC 248 in March. Jung said Ortega hit Park while he was in the bathroom; Ortega was kicked out of the event and later apologized for the incident with a challenge for Jung.</p><p>Ortega vs. Jung will have major ramifications for UFC's featherweight division. Jung called featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski "shameful' after Volkanovski narrowly defended his title with a split-decision victory over former champ Max Holloway in July. In response, Volkanovski said that Jung could earn a title fight with a decisive victory over Ortega. Ortega's last match was a loss against Holloway, so his path to the title may be a bit longer, even with a win over Jung.</p><p><a href="https://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/196318/531511/9070?u=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.espn.com%2Fufc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored">UFC Fight Night: Ortega vs. Jung</a> is the fourth match in a series of five UFC events scheduled in Abu Dhabi through October 24.

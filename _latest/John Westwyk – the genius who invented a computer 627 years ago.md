This is the story of a man who 627 years ago designed a machine (a computer), six feet across, of polished wood and brass, that could find the position of the planets or predict it for any year. Explaining his life’s work makes a bigger point: that Edward Gibbon’s phrase the “darkness of the Middle Ages” was misconceived, even with regard to experimental science.

It seems to me that Gibbon’s attitude still prevails and most people think the medieval world-view foolishly muddled. Before diving in to Seb Falk’s counter-narrative, focusing on astronomy, it might be worth trying out this brief thought experiment. We speak of the Sun rising and setting, but we say that it just looks as though the Sun goes around the Earth. Really, we say, the Earth goes around the Sun. Yet the explanation of the Sun’s apparent rising and setting is not, as many unthinkingly say, that the Earth goes around the Sun. That takes a year. The explanation is that the Earth spins on its axis.

I suggest that we need to jettison a snobbish assumption of present-day superiority of intellect if we are to understand the scientific theories of the Middle Ages. I was a little disappointed that Seb Falk took the High Middle Ages, the 14th century, as his period, rather than earlier centuries, around the life of Charlemagne (AD 800) or Alfred the Great (900), with darker reputations but just as much light in reality.

But astronomy, a science in which medieval thinkers excelled, is a good vehicle (if we can keep up with the geometry) to explain the arithmetic, map-making or medicine that went with it. If anyone can make it clear, it is Seb Falk, a Cambridge historian, with his carefully constructed narrative and prose as plain as a well-forged “label”, or rotating pointer on an astrolabe.

His hero John Westwyk took his name from a manor near the Roman ruins of Verulamium and became a monk at St Albans Abbey, a place of learning with established relations with the monarch. Later he transferred to the monastery at Tynemouth and, more surprisingly, in 1383 went on crusade, getting no further than Ypres. A decade later, in his own hand in a manuscript that was for a time attributed to Chaucer, John Westwyk left the construction plans and user manual for the equatorium, his wheel-upon-wheel machine. In 1955 a nice edition in green cloth was published by Cambridge University Press under the title The Equatorie of the Planetis. A little-thumbed copy sits on a shelf at home.

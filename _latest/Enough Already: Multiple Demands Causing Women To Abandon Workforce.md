<p>Here's a stunning stat: Women are leaving the workforce <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/02/919152104/jobs-growth-continues-to-slow-in-last-employment-report-before-election">at four times the rate</a> as men. </p>   <p>The burden of parenting and running a household while also working a job during the pandemic has created a pressure cooker environment in many households, and women are bearing the brunt of it.</p>   <p>It has come to a head as a new school year starts with many children staying home instead of returning to their classrooms in person because of the pandemic. And its forcing many women to make a difficult choice and drop out of the workforce altogether.</p>   <p>Just in September, 865,000 women over 20 dropped out of the American workforce compared with 216,000 men in the same age group, the Labor Department reported Friday.</p>   <p>"It was a really startling difference," said University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson. "The child care crisis is wreaking havoc on women's employment."</p>   <p>Youli Lee is one of those women who hit <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/29/918127776/this-is-too-much-working-moms-are-reaching-the-breaking-point-during-the-pandemi">the breaking point</a> of working from home while caring for her children. She took a leave of absence from her federal job after finding it impossible to do her normal work from home while her three children &#8212; ages 8, 11, and 13 &#8212; were also at home doing virtual school.</p>

   <p>When news came that the kids' schools in Fairfax County, Va., would only partially reopen at best, she decided: "I can't keep this up. This is too much." </p>   <p>Stevenson says the burden of home schooling, cooking and cleaning "is taking its toll on a lot of families. Even when men are doing more than they've perhaps done in any other generation, it's still not half."</p>   <p>Indeed, the Labor Department finds that married mothers do <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4242525/">almost double</a> the amount of household chores and parenting as married fathers.</p>   <p>At the end of 2019, women held <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/10/795293539/women-now-outnumber-men-on-u-s-payrolls">just over half</a> of all payroll jobs, for only the second time in history. Now, women now account for <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t21.htm">49.7% of the workforce</a>. </p>   <p>"Women got hit hardest, earliest," <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/08/829141182/women-are-losing-more-jobs-in-coronavirus-shutdowns">by layoffs</a> in restaurants, retail, and health care &#8212; industries that were hard hit by the pandemic and which employ a lot of women, Stevenson notes.</p>

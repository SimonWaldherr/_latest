When Tim Cook appears on camera for Apple’s reveal of its latest series of iPhones on Tuesday, the Alabama-born CEO will host an iPhone launch like no other.

The company typically holds its glitzy product showcases in packed auditoriums in Cupertino where fans, journalists and employees often burst into spontaneous applause and cheering.

Tuesday’s launch will be different for many reasons. Aside from the pandemic forcing the event online, Apple is expected to break from tradition and unveil a phone significantly under £1,000.

That was the benchmark set by the iPhone X, which launched in 2017. At the time, Apple’s key product risked becoming a luxury good rather than an essential device to be upgraded every few years.

In the years since, Apple has backed away from the precipice of committing to an era of £1,000 phones. All signs point to Apple continuing this strategy on Tuesday.

“They're never going to go back,” says Ben Wood, the chief of research at CCS Insight. “I think they are very comfortable with not having to rely on only selling £1,000 phones that are packed with margins.”

Analysts expect the release of the iPhone 12 to kick off an all-important upgrade “supercycle” which Cook will hope causes millions of customers to ditch their older smartphones in order to switch to the latest models.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says the iPhone 12 launch will be the “most important product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014.”

“The hearts and lungs of the Apple growth story are built around iPhone installed base upgrades,” he says.

Apple is likely to launch four different iPhones, catering to everyone from regular smartphone shoppers looking for an improved camera and battery life, all the way through to loyal Apple fans wanting the most expensive model available.

Cristiano Ronaldo has tested positive for coronavirus, the Portuguese Football Federation has confirmed.

The Juventus star is said to be "doing well, without symptoms, and in isolation", with no further positive tests reported in the squad ahead of Wednesday's Nations League match against Sweden.

The PFF confirmed in a statement: "Following the positive case, the remaining players underwent new tests this Tuesday morning, all with a negative result, and are available to Fernando Santos for training this afternoon, in Cidade do Futebol.

"The game (against Sweden), counting for the qualification phase of the Nations League, is scheduled for Wednesday, at 19:45, in Alvalade."

On Monday, the Juventus forward posted a photo on Twitter showing him and the rest of the Portugal squad having a meal together. The players were all close to each other at a table, with Ronaldo apparently taking the photo himself at the front end.

Along with the tweet, Ronaldo wrote, in Portuguese, "United on and off the field!"

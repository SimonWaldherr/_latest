President Obama&#8217;s campaigning for Sleepy Joe Biden.&#8217; I said, 'That&#8217;s good news or bad news? Tell me, are you saying it&#8217;s good or it&#8217;s bad?' &#8216;Well, I guess it&#8217;s bad.&#8217; No, it&#8217;s good,&#8221; Trump said at the rally. &#8220;There is nobody that campaigned harder for 'Crooked'&#160;Hillary Clinton than Obama. He was all over the place.&#8221;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Obama delivered his first in-person speech on behalf of Biden at an event in Philadelphia, shortly before Trump took the stage in North Carolina.

Then he said, &#8216;he will not get the nomination.&#8217; Then I got the nomination. Then he said, &#8216;he will not be our president.&#8217; Then I won,&#8221; Trump added. &#8220;The only one more unhappy than Crooked Hillary that night was Barack Hussein Obama.&#8221;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>In his Philadelphia speech, Obama ripped the Trump administration&#8217;s response to the coronavirus pandemic. He argued that Trump inherited the &#8220;longest streak of job growth in American history&#8221; and &#8220;messed it up.&#8221;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends,&#8221; Obama said at the event. &#8220;This is not a reality show. This is reality, and the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously.&#8221;</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Trump also took aim at Biden during the Gastonia rally, repeating his frequent allegation that the former vice president is a &#8220;corrupt&#8221; politician. </p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cash-advantage-over-trump-presidential-election">BIDEN ENTERS FINAL STRETCH WITH LARGE CASH ADVANTAGE OVER TRUMP</a></strong></p><p>The president accused prominent media outlets and technology firms of attempting to suppress a New York Post report on a laptop that purportedly contained emails exchanged between Hunter Biden and business associates in China and Ukraine. </p><p>&#8220;If Biden wins, China will own the United States. The media and the big tech are desperately trying to cover up this massive scandal,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not just running against Joe Biden. I&#8217;m running against the corrupt media. They&#8217;re corrupt.

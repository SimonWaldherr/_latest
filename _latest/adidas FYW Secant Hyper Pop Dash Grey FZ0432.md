Following the reveal of their recent project with INVINCIBLE, the Three Stripes is once again looking to further increase their range of trail-appropriate footwear with the introduction of the adidas FYW Secant. If it’s bulbous/multidirectional grip outsole looks familiar to you, that’s because it owns the very same bottom unit as the adidas FYW XTA, another adidas hiker that made its way to the market earlier this year.

It’s upper design elements are what help it stand on its own as it is manufactured with a combination of nylon tongues, lateral/medial synthetic walls dressed up with exposed stitched three stipe logos, and suede overlays that latch onto the toe tips and heels. Branding is present in two areas including a tiny hit on the outer toe box as well as on the tongues. Two outdoor-ready colorways including a “Hyper Pop” and a “Semi Frozen Yellow” are set to arrive soon, the former of which is scheduled for a release in Europe come October 16th for $140 USD. Peep a closer look at each pair here, and stay tuned for more information regarding their stateside drop on adidas.com.

Amazon Prime Day 2020 will deliver thousands of deals to Amazon Prime members on October 13 and 14, and it might be the best way to get your hands on this year's hottest video game console, the Nintendo Switch.

The Switch has been the bestselling gaming console during a record-setting year for video game sales, drawing in millions of new players with its unique portable design. The more advanced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will be released later this fall, but exclusive Nintendo franchises, like "Super Mario," "Pokemon," and "The Legend of Zelda," will continue to make the Switch a hit for years to come.

Increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic has made the $300 Switch hard to find, but don't be surprised if Amazon has set some aside for Prime Day. The $200 Switch Lite has been somewhat easier to find, with bundles offered in your choice of grey, yellow, turquoise, and coral. Keep in mind that the Switch Lite cannot connect to another display, so if you want to play on your living room TV, don't settle for a Switch Lite.

We'll be keeping an eye on Nintendo Switch deals during the weekend, and on October 13 and 14 when Prime Day officially launches. This post will be updated as new sales start, so check back regularly. For more Prime Day coverage, you can follow all the best Prime Day tech deals here.

Early Amazon Prime Day Nintendo Switch deals

Amazon Prime Day doesn't officially start until October 13, but you can already find Amazon discounts on Nintendo Switch games, like "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" and "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild." Current sales on Switch cases and accessories include a wireless Switch Pro Controller for $24 and a $25 carrying case on sale for $14.

Standard Switch consoles are currently out of stock, but a Switch Lite bundle with a 128GB SD card is available for $225. The deal only saves about $10, but the Switch Lite has been difficult to find outside of these sorts of bundles.

When is Prime Day?

Amazon Prime Day 2020 will officially take place on October 13 and 14, but some sales are already underway. You'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to claim these Nintendo Switch deals; a prime subscription costs $13 per month or $120 per year, and includes benefits like free two-day shipping, free books on Kindle, and on-demand Prime Video streaming.

If you've never used Amazon Prime before, you can sign up for a 30-day trial to take advantage of the deals before paying for Prime.

Nintendo Switch deals to expect on Prime Day

Amazon has confirmed that several Nintendo Switch titles will be on sale for up to 33% off during Prime Day, though we're not sure which yet.

Annual subscriptions to Nintendo Switch Online with a 128 GB SanDisk MicroSD card will also be 36% off during Prime Day. Nintendo Switch Online usually costs $20 per year and provides access to dozens of classic Nintendo games, many of which were included with the $80 Super Nintendo Classic in 2017.

Demand for Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite consoles has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic so don't expect many to be in stock on Prime Day. The Switch is rarely discounted below $300 but we could see console bundles that offer multiple games or Switch accessories at a lower price.

Nintendo Switch deals we saw on Prime Day last year

Last year's Prime Day deals included a Switch bundle with a $35 Nintendo eshop card for $300. Amazon's competitors frequently bundle the Switch with a $60 game during Black Friday and other major sales, so the Prime Day deal might not necessarily provide the best value for a Switch bundle if you can wait a few weeks.

We also saw slight discounts on popular Nintendo Switch games, like "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" and "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe," and can expect more of Nintendo's hit titles to show up on sale this year.

How to shop for a Nintendo Switch

Nintendo offers two versions of the Switch — the $300 standard console and the $200 Switch Lite. Both consoles run the same games, but there are some key differences with the hardware.

The standard Switch has two removeable "Joy-cons" that can be used as controllers, and can be connected to a television. The Switch Lite's controls cannot be removed from the screen and it cannot use the Switch dock to connect to a larger TV or monitor. This also means that games that require the Joy-cons for motion control, like "Super Mario Party," will require a separate controller with the Switch Lite.

The difference in size has some other impacts, too. The Switch Lite has a 5.5-inch screen while the standard Switch has a 6.2-inch screen. The standard Switch's battery can last for up to nine hours, while the Switch Lite tops out at seven hours.

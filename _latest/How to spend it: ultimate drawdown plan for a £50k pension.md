<p>There are countless ways to spend a pension and sudden access to a large pot of money can be a big temptation for even the most sensible of us. But careful retirement planning means that even modest savings can go a long way.&#160;</p>
<p>Those on final salary-style pensions do not have to worry about turning them into an income. Millions of others, however, with "defined contribution" plans&#160;have to work out how to turn a pot of money into an income to last for decades into the future.</p>
<p>Since the 2015 "pension freedom" reforms, DC pensions have become incredibly flexible. But with that flexibility comes complexity &#8211; you have to navigate the tax system, potentially&#160;make investment decisions and decide how much to take and when.</p>
<p>Pension savers between the age of 55 and 64, who had not yet started drawing from their pot, had median DC pension wealth of &#163;28,500, according to figures compiled by the&#160;Office for National Statistics for 2016 to 2018.&#160;</p>
<p>But those reaching pension age with &#163;50,000 in their pension pot will need to set up a careful plan if they do not want to risk running out of money early into their retirement. Luckily, there are several different options open to them.&#160;</p>
<p>First of all, you must work out exactly what you want to put this money towards. Some will need it as a low but reliable source of income for as long as possible, while others may want to use it for passion projects or to pay off the final part of a mortgage.&#160;</p>
<p>How fast you draw down your pension depends on how much you will need to cover your living costs and when you will need it most. It will also depend on whether your pension will be your only source of income or if you have a second property, an Isa or dividends from stock market investments.&#160;</p>
<p>There is no one-size fits all to managing a pension and with a &#163;50,000 pot there are fewer options than those open to wealthier savers. Below we explore some strategies for making the best use of your money.</p>
<h4>Top up your state pension</h4>
<p>The new<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/state-pension-boost-guaranteed-government-despite-plunging-wages/"> state pension pays</a> &#163;9,110 per year to those who receive it in full and currently the state pension age is 66. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, an industry body, conducted research that estimated that you need a minimum income of &#163;10,200 per year, or &#163;15,700 if you are a couple, to live on.&#160;This does not include&#160;other costs &#8211; most&#160;notably housing &#8211; but also&#160;social care and any tax on pension income.</p>
<p>So if you received the full state pension you would need to use at least &#163;1,090 a year of your private pension to meet this minimum requirement.</p>
<p>A comfortable standard of living would require &#163;33,000 a year, according to the PLSA, meaning&#160;you would have to top up the state pension with &#163;23,890 a year, running the pot dry within a couple of years.&#160;</p>

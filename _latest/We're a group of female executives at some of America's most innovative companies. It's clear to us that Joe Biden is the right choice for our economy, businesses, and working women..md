Women CEOs, Managing Partners, company founders, and other senior leaders across corporate America say the nation will be safer, stronger, and readier for economic growth if Joe Biden wins in November.

President Trump's policies and behavior undermine the contributions of over half the nation. Without the backbone of women workers and leaders, America will not thrive.

Joe Biden has a plan to get a handle on the nation's public health and economic crisis, to build back better and stronger, and to stand up for women in the workplace.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

We are women who work at some of the nation's most innovative and successful companies. We compete fiercely, sometimes with one another. But we all agree that America will be safer, stronger, and ready for economic growth if Joe Biden is elected in November.

Donald Trump came to office promising that his business "know-how" would help America. With all due respect, Mr. President, we know business. We are engineers, marketers, CEOs, and strategists for some of the most beloved products and services in America. What companies and countries actually need to thrive is an environment where facts govern, laws and norms are respected, and people of every stripe have a chance to contribute and compete.

In all of those areas, we've lost ground during Donald Trump's presidency. And women, particularly women of color, feel it every day. Things have gotten worse for working women and their families because Trump hasn't followed the facts. That's why we are standing up to support Joe Biden.

We feel particular urgency because as women, we have worked hard to be seen, to be heard, and to succeed — and we won't go back. Trump has rolled back protections against discrimination and harassment in the workplace, called pregnancy an "inconvenience" for employers, openly mocked professional women, and denigrated his own female staff. This kind of behavior from a president undermines the contributions of over half of our nation. Without the backbone of women workers and leaders, America will not thrive.

We are grateful for the opportunities America has given us. We want more Americans to have the chance to contribute, compete, and excel. But doors for American women will be harder to open so long as we have a president who mismanages Americans' health and safety, destabilizes the economy, and denigrates women. It's time for change. It's time for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

Getting a handle on this public health and economic crisis

Trump lied to the American people about America's public health crisis from the start. Even now, eight months later, he still doesn't have a plan to get it under control, and we've lost over 200,000 American lives as a result.

Working women are bearing the brunt of Trump's mismanagement. Biden has detailed how the federal government can help states reopen safely and sustainably, including calling on every American to wear a mask, providing free testing and treatment, fighting for the development of a safe and effective vaccine, producing the necessary protective equipment and supplies, and boosting funding for childcare so working parents can go back to work with peace of mind. Biden's plan will give us a shot at getting businesses and families back to normal.

Building back better and stronger

Tens of millions of hard-working Americans have lost jobs, hours, pay, health care, and/or businesses thanks to Trump's mismanagement. But as we recover, we need to build back better than before. Even before COVID, millions were locked out of an economy that rewards wealth over work and helps too few to make ends meet. Working women need Joe Biden's plan to revitalize American manufacturing and innovation, support small businesses, expand educational opportunities while getting a handle on student debt, and create vocational training programs that expand pipelines into good-paying jobs.

And, having been a single parent for five years, Biden understands the challenges of finding affordable, reliable childcare. He has a plan to help parents balance work and caregiving duties, which so often fall on working mothers.

Standing up for women in the workplace

Joe Biden treats women with the dignity and respect we deserve. He championed the Violence Against Women Act. He will continue to fight for equal pay for equal work, by enacting the Paycheck Fairness Act. He will end discrimination against pregnant and nursing workers, by enacting Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. He will also make systemic changes to address sexual harassment and other discrimination in the workplace, by signing into law the Be HEARD Act.

Recently, we lost one of America's most fearless champions, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her fight for gender equality made it possible for more of us to work and succeed, and we carry her fight forward. As she said, "Women will have achieved true equality when men share with them the responsibility of bringing up the next generation." Joe Biden understands and shares that responsibility. He respects women's contributions to society and has made it his life's work to create opportunity for generations to come.

Please join the fight — without panic, without despair, and with Justice Ginsburg guiding us — to elect Vice President Biden and Senator Harris in November.

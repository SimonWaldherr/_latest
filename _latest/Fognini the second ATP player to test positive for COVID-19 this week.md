Fognini the second ATP player to test positive for COVID-19 this week

From a "bad time" to Slam No. 20: Nadal undecided about rest of season

Nadal brings down curtain on unique Roland Garros in the right spirit

Following the completion of Roland Garros, a second ATP player has tested positive for COVID-19 this week.

Two days after Sam Querrey pulled out of St. Petersburg, Fabio Fognini was forced to withdraw from Sardinia on Wednesday. The top seed shared the news in an Instagram story, written in his native language.

The tournament put out a statement to confirm Fognini's abrupt exit.

“Following the return of a positive COVID-19 test result on October 14, Fabio Fognini has been withdrawn from the Forte Village Sardegna Open,” the statement read. “Mr. Fognini has been moved into isolation. The tournament physician and ATP medical team will continue to monitor his condition. A contact tracing is currently underway to identify and notify any individuals who have come into contact with him.”

Partnered with compatriot Lorenzo Musetti, the world No. 16 had already lost in the first round of the doubles and was set to play his opening singles match on Wednesday. Lucky loser Danilo Petrovic, who replaced Fognini, defeated Roberto Carballes Baena, 6-1, 6-4.

On Monday, Querrey withdrew from the St. Petersburg Open after the event confirmed that an unnamed player had tested positive.

“Following the return of a positive COVID-19 test result on Sunday, October 11 at the ATP 500 tournament in St. Petersburg, Russia, a player has been withdrawn from the tournament,” the event statement read.

Viktor Troicki moved into Querrey's spot in the draw, falling to No. 2 seed Denis Shapovalov, 6-2, 6-3, in Wednesday's opening match.

  Apple pulls plug on charger and headphones with iPhones in bid to cut carbon emissions 
description: > 
  A compatible adapter bought directly from Apple will cost £29.95, and the EarPods and additional £29.The company will also stop bundling the accessories with previous models of the iPhone.It estimated that there were already 700m sets of EarPods and 2bn Apple power adapters in the world, in addition to the many third party alternatives.Removing the wall adapter and headphones will avoid the unnecessary mining and use of precious materials, it said.It will also allow for smaller and lighter iPhone boxes, which means it can increase the boxes on each shipping pallet by 70pc and ultimately reduce carbon emissions in its global logistics chain.

<div><p>Apple customers will have to pay extra for a&#160;charging adapter&#160;and headphones when <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/14/iphone-12-release-uk-price-specs-size-battery-pre-order-apple/">buying the new iPhone</a>&#160;as the company will no longer provide them in the box, it confirmed during a virtual event showing off its latest line of devices.&#160;</p>
<p>The new phones, beginning&#160;at&#160;&#163;699, will come with a Lightning-to-USB C-cable. A compatible&#160;adapter bought directly from Apple will cost&#160;&#163;29.95, and the EarPods and additional&#160;&#163;29.</p>
<p>Apple claimed&#160;it was removing the accessories because it believed most customers either have an old pair of EarPods or use their own wireless buds and&#160;charging device when they buy a new phone.&#160; The company will also stop bundling the accessories with previous models of the iPhone.</p>

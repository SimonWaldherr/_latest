<div><p>October wouldn&#8217;t be October without pumpkins and squash. Although the two are often confused, pumpkins are in fact a type of squash and both come in a range of sizes, shapes and colours &#8211; from small, scalloped-edge patty-pan squash to giant pumpkins weighing more than a ton.</p>
<p>They tend to have a sprawling habit and it&#8217;s always a thrill to find the fruits hidden beneath the maze of leaves, particularly when you find a whopping one. Winter squash are the most flavoursome and store well; summer squash are best harvested young; while orange pumpkins are best for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/31/halloween-2018-trick-or-treating-really-celtic-tradition/">Halloween</a> carving.</p>
<p>Pumpkins and squash are easy to grow and once plants have established they develop at an impressive speed. I once met a gardener who believed that if he looked directly at his pumpkins they&#8217;d stop growing, so he would avert his gaze while walking past them.</p>
<h3>Growing advice</h3>
<p>You can either start plants off indoor from April to May, or sow in situ from May to June. At <a href="https://www.greatdixter.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Great Dixter</a>, East Sussex, kitchen gardener Aaron Bertelsen starts them off in a greenhouse in early spring in 5in (12.5cm) pots, then plants them out in late spring when all chances of frost have passed.</p>

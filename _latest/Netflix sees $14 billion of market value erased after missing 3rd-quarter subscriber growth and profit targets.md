<p>Netflix emphasized the importance of a long-term view. Its miss on subscriber growth "is really just forecast noise more than anything else," Spencer Wang, vice president of finance at Netflix, said in a call with analysts, according to Sentieo transcripts.</p><p>"We just really don't overfocus on any 90-day period," he added. "If the quarter was 48 hours longer, we would have come in slightly above our guidance forecast."</p><p>Still, analysts balked at the quarterly figures. Economic reopening and growing competition from Disney Plus and Comcast's Peacock "are likely to pressure the stock in the short term," Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said.</p><p>Stifel analysts led by Scott Devitt praised Netflix's retention and engagement, but showed concern toward the "sluggish" subscriber-growth trend. The streaming company's shares "may wrestle with several upside and downside factors" as investors shift focus from encouraging fourth-quarter seasonality to the slowed pace of user growth, the team wrote Wednesday.</p><p>Netflix closed at $525.42 per share on Tuesday, up roughly 63% year-to-date. &#13;

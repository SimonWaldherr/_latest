  World could get a Covid-19 vaccine in the next few months but the virus will exist 'forever' 
description: > 
  Epidemiologist Professor John Edmunds, who is part of the Government's scientific advisory group, says a Covid-19 vaccine could be available worldwide in the next few months.WHEN WILL A COVID-19 VACCINE BE READY There are high hopes a Covid-19 vaccine will be doled out, at least for the most vulnerable people, by the end of winter or early 2021.When asked what the chances were of a vaccine being available this winter, he added: 'Towards the end of winter - it's certainly possible.Professor Edmunds said that with a vaccine potentially on the horizon, it was important to try to keep Covid-19 cases low.Professor Edmunds also confirmed to the committees that in September, SAGE had suggested a circuit-breaker lockdown to reduce cases.

The immune system then learns how to fight it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. Valneva: 60million&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Government has given Valneva &#8212; whose vaccine is understood to be in the preclinical stages of development &#8212; an undisclosed amount of money to expand its factory in Livingston, Scotland.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the Government revealed a 60million dose deal on July 20, the company said it had&#160;reached agreement in principle with the UK government to provide up to 100million doses.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Valneva's jab is an inactivated whole virus vaccine, meaning it injects a damaged version of the coronavirus itself into the body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The virus has been destroyed in a way that makes it unable to cause infection, but the body still recognises it as a dangerous intruder and therefore mounts an immune response which it can remember in case of a real Covid-19 infection.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson): 30million</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Government has agreed to buy 30million doses of a vaccine made by Janssen if it works.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Officials have agreed to help the company in its development of the jab by part-funding a global clinical trial. The first in-human trials of Janssen's jab began in mid-July and are being done on adults over the age of 18 in the US and Belgium.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The jab is named Ad26.COV2-S, recombinant, and is a type of jab called a viral vector recombinant vaccine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Proteins that appear on the outside of the coronavirus are reproduced in a lab and then injected into the body to stimulate an immune reaction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 'Ad' part of the vaccine's name means it works using an adenovirus - a virus best known for causing the common cold - as a vehicle to transport the coronavirus genetics into the body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. Novavax: 60million</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain has ordered 60million doses of a vaccine being developed by the US-based company Novavax.

Imperial College London: Unknown quantity</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Imperial College London scientists are working on Britain's second home-grown hope for a jab. The candidate is slightly behind Oxford's vaccine in terms of its progress through clinical trials, but is still a major player.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The UK Government is understood to have agreed to buy the vaccine if it works but details of a deal have not yet been publicised.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Imperial's jab is currently in second-phase human trials after early tests showed it appeared to be safe.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Imperial College London will try to deliver genetic material (RNA) from the coronavirus which programs cells inside the patient's body to recreate the spike proteins. It will transport the RNA inside liquid droplets injected into the bloodstream.&#160;</p><p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_2"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

								<p>Telegraph Media Group (TMG) remains focused on a subscriber-first strategy underpinned by long term investment in The Telegraph&#8217;s digital transformation: the numbers that reflect the success of our business are our subscriber numbers.</p>
<p>TMG&#8217;s transformation will continue into the following years and the 10-1-23 strategy remains central to our vision &#8211; namely the aim to reach 10 million registrants and 1 million subscribers to sign up to the Telegraph by 2023.</p>
<p>We are transparent with our core monthly subscriber numbers which are omni-channel.&#160; We also share both volumes and average revenue per subscription, as below:</p>
<p>In September 2020, The Telegraph had:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>524,412 subscriptions across print and digital, with 12,914 of net new subscriptions this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Digital = 323,917, Print =&#160; 200,495</p></li>
<li><p>ARPS (blended average revenue per subscription) of </p><i><p>&#163;196.11</p></i></li>
<li><p>We have 6,759,908 registrants.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Weekly average number of active subscriptions across the prior financial month. This is for the 5 weeks of September covering 24th August to 27th September.</p>
<p>The Subscriptions and ARPS (annual net revenue per subscription) totals are independently assured by PwC.&#160; The last audit took place for the period ending September 2020. The next audit will take place for the period ending December 2020.&#160;</p>
<p>Key highlights included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Coronavirus and Brexit were the topics dominating subscriber engagement in September. &#160; Live coverage of the second shutdown and the Chancellor&#8217;s speech, along with the comment and analysis pieces surrounding these key stories all drove significant subscriber numbers this month. </p></li>
<li><p>There were agenda setting op-eds from the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer and the Archbishop of Canterbury, along with lots of reader engagement with the views of our columnists.</p></li>
<li><p>Telegraph Travel launched its</p><a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h60da09c2,3963edd4,36b96c53"><p> Test4Travel campaign</p></a> <p>&#160;in September, which called on the Government to roll out affordable Covid-19 tests on arrivals at all UK airports and ports, by Christmas.</p></li>

Europe's COVID-19 outbreak is cascading out of control, prompting national authorities to impose harsh restrictions again in the hope of bringing the virus back under control.

This week, the number of new cases recorded in the European Union and the UK each day exceeded those in the US, starkly reversing an earlier trend.

According to EU data, the total number of daily new cases exceeded an average of 80,000 across the 27-nation bloc plus the UK, which left the EU at the beginning of the year.

The return of mass restrictions in Europe brought to an end a summer in which — unlike in the US — the spread of the virus had significantly slowed.

A graph tweeted by the Washington Post's Glenn Kessler showed the stark reversal:

Here is a rundown of the picture across the continent:

France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands all recorded record high cases on October 14 or 15.

In response, governments have imposed extra restrictions, which many hoped would be limited to the nationwide lockdowns of spring:

Despite the rising number of infections recorded, the number of people dying from the virus remains far smaller than earlier in the year.

Possible reasons include better public health measures, the increased ability of healthcare systems to treat people, and the fact that many of the most vulnerable have already died.

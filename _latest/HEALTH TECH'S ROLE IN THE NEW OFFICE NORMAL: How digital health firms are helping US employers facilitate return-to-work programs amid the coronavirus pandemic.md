    The coronavirus pandemic has thrown the US economy into a state of flux, forcing businesses into uncharted territory as they decide when and how to reopen. Before the pandemic, 39% of US office employees worked remotely&#8212;which nearly doubled to 77% during the pandemic, <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/us-remote-work-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per</a> a June PwC survey.&#160; Now, company leaders across the US are strategizing how to resume operations and restore normalcy by bringing their employees back into the office. In order to reopen brick-and-mortar offices, warehouses, and stores, it'll be of paramount importance for employers to navigate how to do so safely and instate routines that curb the spread of the coronavirus. Otherwise, employers risk creating sites of new outbreaks and being forced to shut their doors yet again.</p><p>

</p><p>The pandemic could hike up employer medical spending&#8212;creating an even greater sense of urgency for products that help ensure workers are in good health. The pandemic could increase self-insured employers' medical spending by as much as 10% in 2021, per PwC's <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/behind-the-numbers.html">estimates</a>. For context, this estimate was calculated under the assumption the wave of coronavirus cases erupting in the spring of 2020 would lead patients to defer care to 2021. So, investing in programs that will maintain the health and safety of workplaces will be top-of-mind for businesses looking to preemptively rein in medical spending now, considering it could tick up over the course of the year.&#160;</p><p>Tech companies and digital health startups are rolling out software to facilitate the return-to-work transition for employees.

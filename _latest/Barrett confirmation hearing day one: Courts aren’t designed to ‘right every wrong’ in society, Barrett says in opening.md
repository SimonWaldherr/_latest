Barrett made her formal introduction before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, pledging to be a justice who will apply the law “as written” and paying tribute to justices across the ideological spectrum who came before her: Justices Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O’Connor and Ginsburg.

Barrett hewed close to her prepared remarks, which were made public on Sunday, in which she stressed her philosophy that courts were not a place where every right or wrong in society should be corrected.

“The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people,” Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try.”

She noted that Scalia — for whom she clerked — believed that a judge must apply the law as written and not as he or she wished it were.

“It was the content of Justice Scalia’s reasoning that shaped me,” Barrett said.

As for her female predecessors, Barrett praised O’Connor — the first woman to sit on the Supreme Court — as a “model of grace and dignity” and paid tribute to Ginsburg’s storied career.

“I have been nominated to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat, but no one will ever take her place,” Barrett said. “I will be forever grateful for the path she marked and the life she led.”

She told the committee that a Supreme Court seat was “not a position I had sought out” and that she “thought carefully” before accepting the nomination. Senate documents show she accepted it Sept. 21, three days after Ginsburg’s death.

Barrett also nodded to her family, sitting behind her except for her youngest child, Benjamin, who is staying with friends. Earlier Monday, Benjamin was calling out the names of his siblings as he saw them on television, Barrett said.

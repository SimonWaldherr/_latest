University students may have a case for demanding refunds if “learning outcomes” cannot be delivered, the Russell group chair has said.

With some practical courses such as engineering impossible to teach without face to face classes, some students could be entitled to their money back, according to Dame Nancy Rothwell, who is also President and Vice Chancellor of the University of Manchester.

“At the moment what we're saying is that you're paying for getting what's called learning outcomes,” she said.

“And at the end of the year, if you have not met those learning outcomes if we've not been able to deliver them to you, then you will have a case.

“Until then we'll do our very very best to ensure that we can deliver those learning outcomes in the best way possible.”

  The Crown Prosecution Service has published a list of 39 rape myths - let's hope they read it themselves 
description: > 
  This is the very same CPS which has been telling detectives to demand that women who’ve been raped hand over their mobile phones, jeopardising the sensitive relationship between victims and police.“How are my officers expected to know how girls from that country text each other?” he asked.Prosecutions and convictions more than halved over three years, from 5,190 prosecutions in 2016-17 to only 2,102 in the last year.The assumption that a discontinued case equates to a false allegation was allowed to run riot.It’s one of the myths challenged in the new guidance, which correctly says that “a decision to stop a case on evidential grounds does not mean that an allegation is false”.

<div><p>But we must ask where that implication has come from. This is the very same CPS which has been telling detectives to demand that women who&#8217;ve been raped hand over their mobile phones, jeopardising the sensitive relationship between victims and police.</p>
<p>A senior officer once told me that his team had been advised by the CPS to get translations of 800 texts on a foreign rape victim&#8217;s phone, without any evidence that they were relevant to the crime. &#8220;How are my officers expected to know how girls from that country text each other?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The practice was criticised by the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office earlier this year, but a new notice that was supposed to end the so-called<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/much-ending-digital-strip-search-rape-victims-back/"> &#8220;digital strip search&#8221;</a> has been so heavily criticised that some forces aren&#8217;t using it.</p>
<p>There is no mystery about how this situation came about. Prosecutions and convictions more than halved over three years, from 5,190 prosecutions in 2016-17&#160; to only 2,102 in the last year. The fall coincided with a period of lurid headlines about men whose prosecutions had been dropped, some at the last minute, and a panicked response by government ministers.</p>
<p>The assumption that a discontinued case equates to a false allegation was allowed to run riot. It&#8217;s one of the myths challenged in the new guidance, which correctly says that &#8220;a decision to stop a case on evidential grounds does not mean that an allegation is false&#8221;. Better late than never, I suppose.</p>

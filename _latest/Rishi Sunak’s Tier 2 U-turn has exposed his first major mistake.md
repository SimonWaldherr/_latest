<div><p>Support for the self-employed was doubled. the Government will increase the amount of profits covered by the two forthcoming self-employed grants from 20 per cent to 40 per cent, meaning the maximum grant will increase from &#163;1,875 to &#163;3,750.</p>
<p>This was a significant package, but by getting it wrong in the first place the Chancellor has left himself open to easy criticism from the Labour Opposition. Anneliese Dodds went on the attack, claiming the government is catching up with what Labour called for months ago.</p>
<p>His delay in acting has had &#8220;real consequences [&#8230;] parts of our country have spent months under Tier 2 restrictions, without adequate support.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many jobs have been lost? Over a million have already gone... the Chancellor could have done much more if he had acted sooner [&#8230;] &#8220;For months we have urged the Chancellor to get ahead of the looming unemployment crisis and act to save jobs&#8230; Instead, we&#8217;ve had a patchwork of poor ideas rushed out at the last minute.&#8221; the Labour frontbencher said.</p>
<p>The speech was an acknowledgement of the grim situation we are in. Large parts of the economy are back in survival mode due to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/22/uk-cases-covid-19-deaths-coronavirus-numbers-today/">rising infections,</a> and until they get through the winter crisis they cannot possible enter restructure mode, which was the central purpose of the original Winter Economic Plan. The government must be ahead of the game, because with every mistake the economy suffers.&#160;</p>

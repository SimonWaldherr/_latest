<div><p id="speakable-summary">Adobe today launched the first public version of its <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator vector graphics app</a> on the iPad. That&#8217;s no surprise, given that it was already available for pre-order and as a private beta, but a lot of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/illustrator" target="_blank">Illustrator </a> users were looking forward to this day.</p>
<p>In addition, the company also today announced that its <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/fresco.html">Fresco drawing and painting app</a> is now available on Apple&#8217;s iPhone, too. Previously, you needed either a Windows machine or an iPad to use it.</p>
<p>Illustrator on the iPad supports Apple Pencil &#8212; no surprise there either &#8212; and should offer a pretty intuitive user experience for existing users. Like with Photoshop, the team adapted the user interface for a smaller screen and promises a more streamlined experience.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p></p><p>&#8220;While on the surface it may seem simple, more capabilities reveal themselves as you work. After a while you develop a natural rhythm where the app fades into the background, freeing you to express your creativity,&#8221; the company says.</p>
<p>Over time, the company plans to bring more effects, brushes and AI-powered features to Illustrator in general &#8212; including on the iPad.</p>
<p></p><p>As for Fresco, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what that user experience will look like on a small screen. Since it uses Adobe&#8217;s Creative Cloud libraries, you can always start sketching on an iPhone and then move to another platform to finish your work. It&#8217;s worth noting that the iPhone version will feature the same interface, brushes and capabilities you&#8217;d expect on the other platforms.</p>
<p>The company also today <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/2020/10/20/adobe-fresco-all-in-at-max-2020.html">launched version 2.0</a> of Fresco, with new smudge brushes, support for personalized brushes from Adobe Capture and more.</p>

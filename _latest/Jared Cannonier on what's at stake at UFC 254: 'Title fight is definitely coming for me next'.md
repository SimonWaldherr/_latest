<div><p>ABU DHABI &#8211; <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/jared-cannonier">Jared Cannonier</a> can see UFC gold on the horizon.</p>
<p>The UFC middleweight contender thinks he&#8217;s on the verge of challenging middleweight champion Israel Adesanya if victorious Saturday. Cannonier (13-4 MMA, 6-4 UFC) takes on former champion Robert Whittaker in the co-main event of UFC 254.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the biggest fight of my career. A title fight is definitely coming for me next,&#8221; Cannonier told reporters, including MMA Junkie, on Tuesday at UFC 254 media day.</p>
<p>UFC president <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/09/dana-white-jared-cannonier-next-for-israel-adesanya-with-ufc-254-win">Dana White has said Cannonier is next</a> for Adesanya if he&#8217;s able to get past Whittaker, making UFC 254 a significant moment for &#8220;The Killa Gorilla.&#8221; The champion himself, Adesanya, has targeted Cannonier as the next guy in line and has shown plenty of interest in facing him in the near future.</p>
<p>This makes Cannonier a happy man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Real recognize real,&#8221; Cannonier said. &#8220;He said in his interview he respects my energy, and that means something different to me than what it means to other people. When you start talking energy, I think we&#8217;re seeing each other right there [points to third eye] and that&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of people look at the physicality of the sport and don&#8217;t tap into the mentality of the sport, as well. There&#8217;s a spiritual aspect to this sport. Martial arts is a spiritual thing before it was a physical thing.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Although the future seems promising for Cannonier, he is entering the biggest fight of his UFC career off an injury and lengthy layoff. Cannonier&#8217;s last fight was in September 2019 as a torn pec kept him out of commission. Some might see it as a negative, but the 36-year-old sees it as a sign for better things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though I had the injury, some may see it as a bad thing, but in my experiences in my whole life, especially since leaving home, I&#8217;ve realized whenever something me or anyone perceives as negative, it&#8217;s always followed by something positive &#8211; like a pendulum swing,&#8221; Cannonier explained. &#8220;So with this injury, COVID-19 popping off and everything shutting down, the injury happened at a really good time because I was able to go to my physical therapist. Al Escobar is the man &#8230; not only was he rehabilitating the pec, but he was taking me through a strength and conditioning program that has definitely benefited me in a very major way. You guys will see.&#8221;</p>

  Can M&S's new 'sexy lingerie' label rival Victoria's Secret at Next? 
description: > 
  “We’ve loved creating this brand which is designed to add a contemporary, playful and fun aesthetic to our lingerie collections,” says Soozie Jenkinson, Head of Lingerie Design at M&S.“We blend ingredients such as best in class embroideries, laces and exclusive prints to dress modern silhouettes such as bralettes, camisoles and non-padded bras to create lingerie which is joyful in spirit.”Crucially, the imagery has been considered too - lingerie brands which photograph their collections on women who are not always blonde, lithe, supermodels are the ones having the most success in the designer lingerie market at the moment (see also, the fall of Agent Provocateur, for reference).The brand might turn off those who still want that traditionally-sexy underwear look - but in terms of appealing to a mass market, right now it’s imagery and styles that are sexy, but still wearable, that are selling.

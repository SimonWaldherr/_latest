description: > 
  Isaac Brekken/Associated PressThe NFL and the Players Association announced 19 positive COVID-19 test results, eight from players and 11 from team personnel, during the seven-day testing period that ended Saturday.Here's the full joint statement from Tuesday along with the updated coronavirus testing numbers:The NFL was able to move forward with all 14 games on the Week 6 schedule between Sunday and Monday despite last week's positive tests.The recent uptick in positive tests and game postponements came after the NFL completed the first three weeks of the regular season without issue.It may eventually lead the league to add an 18th week to the regular season, but so far, that hasn't been necessary.For now, the regular season is on track to finish Jan. 3 followed by the playoffs leading up to Super Bowl LV on Feb. 7 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.

<p>Manny Maceda, the CEO of consulting firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-expect-first-year-at-bain-consulting-firm-recruitment-head">Bain &amp; Company,</a> thinks there's three key problems every company needs to solve right now. These problems are digital transformation, defining a corporate purpose, and preserving social capital among employees.&#160;</p><p>Speaking at <a href="https://trendsfestival.com/en/schedule.html?utm_source=tf_usa&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ticket">Business Insider's Global Trends Festival,</a> Maceda said most companies need to shift their strategy to be successful during the pandemic &#8212; and the first thing they need to do is to embrace new technology.&#160;</p><p>"Almost every company, every worker, and every employee in the company had to figure out how to deal with technology on a more remote basis," Maceda said at the event. "Companies are seeing great examples within their walls of how digital transformation can advance. We just believe now that everyone is just going to have to do this and embrace this."&#160;</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic also has chief executives thinking more deeply about their corporate purpose.&#160;</p><p>The CEO explained that there's a responsibility for business leaders to communicate exactly who they are, what they stand for, and how they're leading through turbulent times because it helps retain customers, clients, and employees.&#160;</p><p>Maceda's argument is backed by research. Rebecca Henderson, a Harvard Business School professor who spent years analyzing companies, found that the top 10% of the most productive corporations are high-performing because they are purpose-driven, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hbs-professor-explains-how-corporate-purpose-is-often-misunderstood-2020-2">Business Insider previously reported</a>. Even after the financial crisis, these companies grew substantially and came out stronger, Henderson said.&#160;</p><p>While executives focus on refining their corporate purpose and digital transformation, it's easy to forget one of the most important parts of your company: Employees. Maceda said one of the hardest problems is figuring out how to maintain a positive work environment for employees.&#160;</p><p>"We'll need to make different and new investments, and I've also asked all companies around the world to do that in order to build the bond and loyalty with your team and your company," he said.&#160;</p>

<p>Building a bond with an entirely remote workforce can be a challenge. This is especially hard for consulting firms, which tend to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kpmg-pwc-bcg-future-management-consulting-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-10">hire big classes of college or MBA graduates</a> who are now deprived of the in-person bonding experience due to the coronavirus pandemic.&#160;</p><p>But, the need for in-person meetings isn't going away anytime soon, he said. Employees just need to be more intentional about when they decide to meet going forward.&#160;</p><p>"This is one of the hardest topics that we will all need to solve," he said. "Social capital matters."&#160;</p><p>If you have a tip about a consulting firm that you'd like to share with Business Insider, please email Weng Cheong at wcheong@businessinsider.com.&#160;</p>

<div><p>Tactically, Fabinho's ball-playing skills from deep could prove invaluable in launching quick attacks from defence to attack to send Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah behind opposition defences. There's no need to panic.</p>
<h3>Youth players</h3>
<p>Klopp is a big advocate of coaching rather than buying and said during the summer that this season represents a big opportunity&#160;for academy graduates to break into the first team and save the club money on new signings, a lot like how youth academies are supposed to work. There are three centre-backs on the fringes of the first team, with all given minutes in Liverpool's pre-season friendlies.</p>
<p><strong>Billy Koumetio</strong></p>
<p>A 17-year-old French centre-back, Koumetio joined Liverpool's academy&#160;in January 2019, impressing in training and&#160;friendlies against Salzburg and Blackpool so much&#160;that he was named in the first team squad for the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal. He is around 6'2 or 6'3 tall with a powerful build&#160;and always seems to&#160;have time on the ball... at Under-18 level. Clearly has a lot to learn at such a young age but if given the chance could establish himself as a squad player. That he usually plays on the left side of a central defensive pair is another advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Sepp Van Den Berg</strong></p>
<p>A 6'3,&#160;Dutch,&#160;ball-playing centre-back, the 18-year-old Van Den Berg has already played for the Liverpool first team in FA Cup and Carabao Cup matches last season, though looked a little off the pace as&#160;part of a defence which conceded&#160;five against Aston Villa and five against Arsenal. Then again, Van Dijk played in a team which let in seven against Aston Villa less than three weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Nathaniel Phillips</strong></p>
<p>At 23-years-old, Phillips isn't really a prospect anymore but made 19 appearances at right centre-back during a loan spell at Stuttgart (in the German second division) last season and might be considered experienced enough to provide cover from the bench should something happen to one of Fabinho, Matip or Gomez. Phillips played in the 1-0 FA Cup win over Everton in January, starting alongside Gomez.</p>
<h3>Short-term transfer fixes</h3>
<p>The registration window for free agents closed on October 16, just days before Van Dijk's unfortunate injury, but Liverpool could look to offer&#160;a short-term contract to a couple of realistic options in January.</p>
<p><strong>Adrian Mariappa</strong></p>
<p>The 34-year-old Jamaica international has plenty of Premier League experience and is available after being released by Watford. Wasn't brilliant last season but the same could be said for any of his various teammates who were also relegated.&#160;</p>

Earlier this week, Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon accidentally shared an explicit photo of girlfriend Izabela Guedes on Instagram, in which her breast was exposed, via Awesemo.com. Although the 25-year-old athlete tried to cover it up with an emoji, it was misplaced.

Guedes, a model and swimwear designer, frequently shares bikini-clad shots with her legions of Instagram followers.

As for Gordon, he seems to be doing “alright” since the Magic were bumped from the Orlando bubble earlier this year. On Wednesday, the 6-foot-8 forward posted a highlight reel to social media.

“You could say I’m doing alright,” he captioned the clip, to which Guedes replied with two fire emojis.

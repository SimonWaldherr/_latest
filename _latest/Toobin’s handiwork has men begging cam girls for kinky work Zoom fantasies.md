<div><p>The rest of the world may have been shocked and appalled when New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin was suspended after reportedly getting <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/jeffrey-toobin-was-masturbating-in-front-of-new-yorker-bigs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caught masturbating during a work meeting</a>.</p>
<p>But phone sex operator and cam model Jessie Sage was unfazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I work during the day,&#8221; the Pittsburgher told The Post. &#8220;My clientele is people who are all working.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost every day a client tells me they are jerking off while [in] a meeting,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/sapiotextual/status/1318282824563216386?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>Some have even developed a kink for doing it during what is now a banal staple of the work-from-home life &#8212; video meetings, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/02/sex-workers-reveal-their-struggle-to-survive-the-coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sex workers told The Post.</a> Sage&#8217;s clients on sites, such as OnlyFans, have lately started ordering bespoke videos that relish their unique fantasies for a price.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last week, a client had me make a custom clip pretending I was in a Zoom meeting,&#8221; Sage said. &#8220;All I did was set up a desk, sit in front of Zoom, hit record and talk to the camera as if I was talking to somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of dirty talk, she started the video &#8220;in business mode&#8221; talking about customers. The man paid $100 for the 10-minute clip. What he did with the clip is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>
 
<p>Sage, who has been working in the sex industry for five years, didn&#8217;t find the request strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of times people eroticize circumstances they have to deal with all the time in life,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all fetishes. Most of her clients keep cam sites up in the background at work &#8220;to have something interesting to look at,&#8221; especially now that most people are working from home, said Sage, who is in her 40s. Often, while she&#8217;s broadcasting, her viewers will let Sage know that they&#8217;re stepping away to take a work call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people can manage that without getting in trouble for it,&#8221; she said, alluding to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/jeffrey-toobins-career-in-jeopardy-after-zoom-masturbation-incident/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toobin&#8217;s career-jeopardizing incident</a>. &#8220;They keep their camera where their camera&#8217;s supposed to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s a regular experience for Sage, she&#8217;s &#8220;not at all making excuses for [Toobin&#8217;s] behavior,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a consent violation to have your co-workers watch you do that when they didn&#8217;t sign up for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/21/rose-mcgowan-slams-jeffrey-toobin-defenders-amid-scandal/?_ga=2.128467404.1763245301.1603198642-1582832244.1592328626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the hashtag #MeToobin</a> began trending Tuesday as social media users called Toobin&#8217;s actions a form of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Webcam model Avery Madison said she wouldn&#8217;t knowingly partake in a circumstance like the one Toobin was accused of doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are other people there that are not consenting to this, that&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m willing to do,&#8221; said Madison, who&#8217;s worked in the industry for eight years and lives in Florida. At least once a week, her clients tell her that they&#8217;re using her services during work. If they&#8217;re alone, &#8220;they&#8217;re adults, that&#8217;s their decision,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they get off on the secrecy of it, it kind gives them a rush that they might get caught,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/22/beware-of-the-latest-sex-trend-spite-porn-being-sent-to-naughty-exes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Non-nude fetish-worker and content creator Allie Knox</a>&#8216;s clients also put her show on during the day while at work, she said.</p>
 
<p>Last week, one of Knox&#8217;s clients had her up while in an online lecture for school and forgot to mute her show. When someone tipped her, the notification made a noise on his end of the video chat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody said anything, it was no big deal,&#8221; she said. But, &#8220;he was too scared to do it this week and actually went to class and didn&#8217;t have me on in the background.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because she&#8217;s been doing this kind of work since 2014, Knox wasn&#8217;t surprised at Toobin&#8217;s behavior. &#8220;None of this was a shock. A man being busted jerking, wow,&#8221; she said sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men are f &#8211; &#8211; king pigs, and some of them can&#8217;t control their urges at work time.&#8221;</p>

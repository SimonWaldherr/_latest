I believe it does a disservice to Judge Barrett who deserves a vote, up or down."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Graham said he wasn't worried about the precedent it could set by going around the committee's rules on a quorum, telling reporters, "I worry about the game they're playing, and we&#8217;re not gonna.

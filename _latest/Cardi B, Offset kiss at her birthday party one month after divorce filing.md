Cardi B and Offset are sparking reconciliation rumors after they passionately kissed at her 28th birthday bash in Las Vegas.

The Migos rapper, 28, surprised his estranged wife with a brand-new Rolls Royce truck and in return, she planted a huge smooch on him. The luxe vehicle reportedly has their daughter Kulture’s name embroidered on the seats.

The PDA didn’t stop with their kiss. Offset later shared video on his Instagram Story of Cardi giving him a lap dance while he lay on the floor.

Offset also seems to be the guy behind her birthday billboard.

“Happy Birthday Mommy Love, Kulture,” the LA-based billboard reads.

“Thank you sir 😏😏😏I love it,” Cardi captioned a video of the billboard, seemingly referring to Offset.

The “WAP” rapper filed for divorce from Offset last month after nearly three years of marriage.

Despite looking to end their union, Cardi has defended him throughout their separation, saying he’s “not a bad man” and shooting down rumors he got another woman pregnant.

Stars including Megan Thee Stallion and Kylie Jenner also attended Cardi’s birthday party.

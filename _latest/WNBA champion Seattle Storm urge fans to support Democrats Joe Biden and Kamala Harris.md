  WNBA champion Seattle Storm urge fans to support Democrats Joe Biden and Kamala Harris 
description: > 
  But on Wednesday, the reigning WNBA champions took it one step further.In an exceedingly rare move for a sports organization, the Seattle Storm urged fans to support Democrats Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the upcoming election, posting an endorsement of the Democratic ticket on its team-branded Twitter account.Gilder told The Seattle Times that she believes the team's tweet in support of Biden and Harris is in line with its values as an organization."Thereâ€™s a certain value set that the Storm organization represents that we try to deliver on whenever the owners take a stand on anything," she told the newspaper.Under President Trump, none of the past three WNBA champions have been invited to visit the White House, which has long been a tradition for championship sports teams.

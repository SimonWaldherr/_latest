Larry David still has the enthusiasm for getting married.

The 73-year-old comedian tied the knot with his girlfriend Ashley Underwood in Southern California on Wednesday, People reported.

The couple met in 2017 at the birthday party of mutual friend Sacha Baron Cohen, The New York Times reported in April.

“We were seated next to each other,” David told the Times of their meeting. “Much to her surprise I left before dessert. I was doing so well, banter-wise, I didn’t want to risk staying too long and blowing the good impression.”

Underwood was a producer for Cohen’s Showtime series, “This is America?.”

Cohen’s wife, meanwhile, appeared in the latest season of David’s hit HBO comedy series “Curb Your Enthusiasm.”

David was previously married to environmental activist Laurie David. They have two daughters.

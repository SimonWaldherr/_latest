A Texas woman known as “Jag Booty” was arrested for murder last week for allegedly giving a woman fatal silicone butt injection, according to a report.

Pamela Burnley, 55, was arrested last Thursday after giving the black-market injection to 35-year-old Latora King at her Dallas home, according to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth.

King had traveled to Dallas with a friend and met Burnley at a parking lot before driving to her house with her, the news station reported, citing an arrest warrant.

After Burnley allegedly gave her the injection, King went back to her home and sent her a message to say that she made it.

“Yes baby lay down,” Burnley wrote back.

Days later, King sent Burnley a number of photos of her “grotesquely misshapen buttocks,” which she padded with gauze. She went to the hospital, where she later died, according to the report.

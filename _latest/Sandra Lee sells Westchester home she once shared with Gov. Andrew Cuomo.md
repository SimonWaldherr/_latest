Sandra Lee has sold the beloved Westchester home she shared with ex-love Andrew Cuomo for $1.85 million, The Post can reveal.

Lee, 54, moved to Los Angeles following her split from the New York governor in September 2019 — and has spent this weekend moving into a new home in Malibu.

Lee bought her Westchester home, called Lily Pond, in 2009 for $1.3 million, and it was sold by Greg Schriefer of Sotheby’s.

Despite sharing the home, neither Lee nor Cuomo ever revealed how much of the expenses and taxes Cuomo actually contributed to the property, a source familiar with the couple’s relationship said.

Lee’s new home features an 80-foot waterfront deck over the ocean and sprawling views. Her neighbors include Kate Hudson, movie director Chris Weitz and singer Janet Jackson.

A friend said: “It’s like the South of France meets Malibu!”

“Sandy is doing all sorts of things that she couldn’t do when she was associated with New York State politics,” the pal said. “She joined the board of the World Food Program USA.”

She’s also been spending her days in Los Angeles hosting a new cooking series for “The Today Show” called “Sandra Lee Top Shelf,” and is in negotiations for a new book deal with Meredith publishers.

Cuomo, 64, meanwhile, next week publishes his new book “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic” a memoir that details, day by day, how the crisis unfolded.

Lee was the de facto first lady of New York when she and Cuomo dated from 2005 until their split.

But in April, at the height of the pandemic, she told The New York Times she had been in communication with Cuomo almost every day and was in regular contact with his daughters.

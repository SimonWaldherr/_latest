These Jets are hard to watch — just ask Joe Douglas.

The second-year general manager was spotted by the CBS broadcast burying his face in his hands Sunday after quarterback Joe Flacco was sacked by the Dolphins in the third quarter of a 24-0 loss, which pushed the Jets to 0-6 for the second time in franchise history.

Unlike the 1996 Jets, who lost eight straight before picking up their only victory of the season, it is difficult to imagine these Jets beating anyone, especially with the Bills, Chiefs and Patriots on deck.

The Jets remained the only winless team after six weeks, as the Giants and Falcons both won their games on Sunday.

Only two other teams in NFL history have gone 0-16: the 2008 Lions and 2017 Browns.

If the Jets were to join them, they likely would have the chance to draft highly coveted quarterback Trevor Lawrence out of Clemson with the No. 1 pick.

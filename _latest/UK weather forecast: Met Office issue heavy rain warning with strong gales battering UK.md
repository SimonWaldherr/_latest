 <p>     </p> <p>"It's turning increasingly windy and there's going to be spells of heavy rain around at times."</p> <p> She explained how low pressure is moving in from across the Atlantic bringing "wet and windy" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a>. </p> <p>Monday is set to start with something of a northwest, southeast divide, with the heaviest rain through Northern Ireland and western Scotland.</p>

 <p>"We could see a couple of inches of rainfall," said Ms Lear.</p> <p>Outbreaks of rain will gradually push into northwest England and North Wales, with winds picking up considerably.</p> <p>Central and southeastern areas should stay reasonably dry and bright as weather charts show highs of 15C around London.</p>

 <p>"More of the same to come as we move out of Monday into Tuesday, in fact some of that rain really quite intense," warned Ms Lear.</p> <p>The Environment Agency has put three flood warnings in place and 26 alerts across England for Monday.</p> <p>While the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has eight flood alerts and Natural Resources Wales has 10 and four warnings.</p> <p>The Met Office's long range forecast states the UK can expect unsettled conditions to "dominate the period, with outbreaks of rain and blustery showers in many parts of the UK".</p> <p>"The focus for the heaviest and most frequent rain is across western areas, whilst rather windy conditions particularly in the northwest at times may pose a risk of gales or even severe gales mainly around coastal areas," it adds.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

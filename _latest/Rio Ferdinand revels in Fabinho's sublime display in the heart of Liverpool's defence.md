  Rio Ferdinand revels in Fabinho's sublime display in the heart of Liverpool's defence 
description: > 
  Rio Ferdinand has heaped praise on Fabinho after the Brazilian flawlessly filled in at centre back for Liverpool in their 1-0 Champions League win at Ajax.It's about him starting to establish a relationship with Joe Gomez.Fabinho's team-mate James Milner was also complimentary of the Brazilian's versatility and paid tribute to his spectacular clearance off the line.Liverpool did win the game thanks to a Tagliafico own goal, with the left back diverting Sadio Mane's shot into his own net.Huge win for @LFC in Amsterdam, back 4 excellent especially Fabinho & the 3 attacking subs very good also!

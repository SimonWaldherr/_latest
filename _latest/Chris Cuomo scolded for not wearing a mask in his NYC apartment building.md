<div><p>Chris Cuomo has apparently been marching around his apartment building without a mask on &#8212; despite what he preaches on his primetime cable news show.</p>
<p>Management at Cuomo&#8217;s Manhattan apartment building sent the CNN anchor a letter, obtained by FOX News&#8217; &#8220;Tucker Carlson Tonight,&#8221; that warned him for repeatedly violating the order, and threatened him with a $500 fine.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been observed entering and exiting the building and riding the elevator without the required face coverings,&#8221; reads part of the August 6 letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though staff members have asked you to comply with this requirement, you have refused to do so. This is a violation of the Executive Order, building policy, and places other residents and our staff at risk. There are no exceptions to this rule, and you are required to comply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cuomo was one of the coronavirus&#8217; early <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/31/cnn-anchor-chris-cuomo-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/">highly visible victims</a>, broadcasting from his Hamptons basement after testing positive for COVID-19 in March.</p>
<p>Shortly after the diagnosis, his older brother New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order that masks must be worn in public places throughout the state.</p>
<p>But it seems as if the CNN anchor hasn&#8217;t learned his lesson and isn&#8217;t following the rules.</p>

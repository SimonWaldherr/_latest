However,&#160;Robertson didn&#8217;t exactly give them a great incentive for choosing Trump considering what supposedly happens during his second term.&#160;</p><p>Robertson said the inauguration would be followed by global strife, widespread &#8220;civic disobedience that will be mind-boggling&#8221; in the U.S. and at least two assassination attempts.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;The country will be torn apart,&#8221;&#160;Robertson said, then he went off on some biblical prophecy stuff, claiming there would be a period of war involving Israel, followed by at least five years of &#8220;extraordinary peace.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>After that, better book the next flight off the planet because that&#8217;s when it all goes kaboom.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be a great tribulation,&#8221; Robertson said, predicting an asteroid strike right down to the size of the space rock:</p><p class="video-flip youtube" id="youtube-flip-LAUbsx5iUFk"></p><p>God has an iffy history with presidential predictions, at least in terms of the ones He reportedly shared with Robertson.

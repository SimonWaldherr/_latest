  Donald Trump interrupted classified briefing on Afghanistan to order milkshakes, report says 
description: > 
  Donald Trump interrupted a classified briefing on Afghanistan to order milkshakes, according to reports, in an episode which has become legendary among the intelligence agencies.The president was meeting intelligence chiefs at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey in early 2017, a few months after his inauguration, according to a report in Politico.Among those present was the head of the CIA’s Special Activities Center, which is responsible for covert operations and paramilitary operations.The officials told Politico it was seen as “an early harbinger of Trump’s disinterest in intelligence” - later exemplified by his reported scorn for his classified daily briefing, known as the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB), and his impatience with the briefers.Standing beside Vladimir Putin, he said he had no reason to take his own intelligence community’s assessments more seriously than what Mr Putin himself told him.

<div><p>The river wasn&#8217;t far away. Chaz Powell could see the Zambezi churning over boulders in the gorge a few hundred metres below him. It was tantalisingly close, but out of his reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can't describe how thirsty I was,&#8221; says Powell. Teetering on the edge of a cliff at the top of a gorge, he had run out of water and had no way of getting down to the river. Recalling the precarious position he found himself in, Powell describes an overwhelming feeling of panic as he worried about how to find something to drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;By this point I was starting to feel really ill,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I started to overheat, and my body temperature was just insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell, an expedition guide from Shropshire in the UK, was about to experience what it is like to be stranded without the commodity most of us take for granted.</p>
<p>In most developed countries, accessing clean water is as simple as turning on a tap. People in these places pour gallons of it down the drain every day without a thought, as they brush their teeth, shower and flush the toilet. But around <a href="https://www.worldwatercouncil.org/en/water-supply-sanitation">1.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water</a> around the world, and a total of <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?203746/Water-scarcity-affects-27-billion-finds-new-detailed-report">2.7 billion find water difficult</a> to access for at least one month of the year.</p>
<p>Water is one of the fundamental ingredients for life on Earth and our bodies are mainly composed of it. When we are forced to go without water, things can turn nasty very fast indeed.</p></div>

  Jets trade Steve McLendon to Buccaneers for future draft pick: source 
description: > 
  McLendon signed a one-year extension last October.It would have behooved Douglas to get back 2021 draft compensation (and he obviously tried), but it was the right move to trade him.It will also give Douglas & Co. time to evaluate younger players along the line for the rest of this lost season.

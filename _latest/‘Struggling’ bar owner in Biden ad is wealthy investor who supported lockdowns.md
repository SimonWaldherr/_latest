<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more</p><p>A Michigan music venue owner featured in a Joe Biden ad campaign lamenting his struggles to survive during coronavirus restrictions is actually a wealthy tech investor &#8212; who supported local lockdowns, according to reports.</p>
<p>Joe Malcoun was featured in the heart-tugging Biden ad that aired during NFL games Sunday complaining about the chances of his Ann Arbor bar and music venue, the Blind Pig, surviving the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how much longer we can survive not having any revenue,&#8221; he complained in the ad. &#8220;This is the reality of Trump&#8217;s COVID response &#8230; This is Donald Trump&#8217;s economy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My only hope for my family and this business and my community is that Joe Biden wins this election,&#8221; he claimed, saying it &#8220;makes me so angry.</p>
<p>The ad suggested Malcoun&#8217;s future and his family were at risk, but made no mention of the bar owner&#8217;s numerous other businesses as a wealthy &#8220;angel investor&#8221; in tech companies.</p>
<p>Malcoun admitted in a <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/all-about-ann-arbor/2018/04/14/getting-to-know-ann-arbor-tech-entrepreneur-joe-malcoun/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2018 interview with Click On Detroit</a> that he made his start thanks to a huge inheritance from his wife&#8217;s grandfather, a real estate investor, that he admitted was &#8220;almost like winning the lottery.&#8221;</p>
<p>It soon made him the &#8221; the go-to guy when it came to seeking investments,&#8221; the local news outlet said, helping companies raise millions.</p>
<p>He was also called the &#8220;driving force of entrepreneurship in Ann Arbor&#8221; when he was featured in <a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/awards/joe-malcoun-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crain&#8217;s Detroit Business &#8220;40 under 40&#8221; profile</a>.</p>
 

<p>Malcoun blamed Trump for the lockdowns, but had actually willingly closed the Blind Pig in June despite being allowed to open.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/06/after-testing-the-waters-the-blind-pig-to-hold-off-on-more-live-shows-in-ann-arbor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told MLive at the time</a> that the venue tried &#8220;dipping our toe in the water&#8221; by opening up, but claimed he was more concerned about coronavirus safety than letting in customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what precautions we take or whether or not were doing the legal thing, if we can&#8217;t communicate to the community the main intention of being safe, it&#8217;s not worth it,&#8221; he said in June.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we tried it and saw it&#8217;s really hard to communicate what it means to have a really socially distanced and live music show, we decided it&#8217;s not really worth trying. The very last thing we want is to be the epicenter of a new outbreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said his management would only open &#8220;based on what&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My sense is that it&#8217;s going to be a while,&#8221; said Malcoun, who has donated thousands of dollars to support Biden&#8217;s campaign, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-campaign-ad-michigan-tech-ceo-struggling-bar-owner" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News said</a>, citing local records.</p>
<p>Neither the Biden campaign nor Malcoun responded to Fox&#8217;s requests for comment.</p>

The survey found that voters trust Biden more to handle economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic, 46-44%. The two candidates, however, are tied on who voters trust more when it comes to jobs, each at 44%.</p><p>While the figures are within the margin of error, it's one of the rare surveys that shows Biden outperforming Trump on one of his strongest issues. The shift in polling on economic issues comes as <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-10-20/coronavirus-cases-hospitalizations-are-increasing-in-majority-of-states">COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations surge</a> around the country, signaling that another wave is in sight as flu season ramps up. The pandemic has prompted tens of millions of Americans to lose their jobs, with major industries furloughing and laying off thousands of employees. The current unemployment rate sits at 7.9%.</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on the 2020 Election</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/31c62b1/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fdf%2F6d%2F21f364ca4cd183065abbc59893ea%2F20201019edsuc-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>Wednesday's poll found Biden leading in nearly every category regarding which candidate voters trust more to handle key issues, including on immigration and national security. But voters easily rank economic issues as their top concern when deciding how to vote for other federal offices in Congress. Democrats are in good shape to keep &#8211; or even expand &#8211; their House majority and have a path to retaking the Senate as the party seeks unified government.</p><p>Trump is making the economy the centerpiece of his reelection pitch less than two weeks out from the election, even as that support appears to be eroding. At rallies, he has promised a quick economic recovery despite continuing to downplay a pandemic that is rebounding across the U.S. He has also claimed that Biden will raise taxes if elected. The former vice president has vowed that there will not be any new taxes for individuals making under $400,000 a year.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Even with the economy at the top of voters' minds, the survey found that voters are more concerned about dealing with the public health crisis sparked by the coronavirus, rather than the economic fallout from the pandemic. More than half of voters believe it's more important for the federal government to address the spread of the virus than the economy. Half of voters trust Biden to handle containment of the virus, compared to 35% who prefer the president.</p><p>The president's underwater approval rating appears to be stable and fairly consistent with other public polls: 55% disapprove of the job Trump is doing, while 43% approve.</p><p>The Morning Consult/Politico poll was conducted from Oct. 16-18 and surveyed 1,994 registered voters. The margin of error was 2 percentage points.<br></p></div>

  Adobe brings its misinformation-fighting content attribution tool to the Photoshop beta – TechCrunch

<div><p id="speakable-summary">Adobe&#8217;s work on a chain of custody that could link online images back to their origins is inching closer to becoming a reality. The prototype, part of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/adobe-cai-whitepaper/">Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)</a>, will soon appear in the beta of Photoshop, Adobe&#8217;s ubiquitous image editing software.</p>
<p>Adobe says the preview of the new tool will be available to users in the beta release of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/photoshop" target="_blank">Photoshop </a> and Behance over the next few weeks. The company calls the CAI implementation &#8220;an early version&#8221; of the open standard that it will continue to hone.</p>
<p>The project has a few different applications. It aims to make a more robust means of keeping creators&#8217; names attached to the content they create. But its most compelling use case for CAI would see the tool become a &#8220;tamper-proof&#8221; industry standard aimed at images used to spread misinformation.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>Adobe describes the project&#8217;s mission as an effort to &#8220;increase trust and transparency online with an industry-wide attribution framework that empowers creatives and consumers alike.&#8221; The result is a technical solution that could (eventually) limit the spread of deepfakes and other kinds of misleading online content.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Eventually you might imagine a social feed or a news site that would allow you to filter out things that are likely to be inauthentic,&#8221; Adobe&#8217;s director of CAI, Andy Parson said earlier this year. &#8220;But the CAI steers well clear of making judgment calls &#8212; we&#8217;re just about providing that layer of transparency and verifiable data.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The idea sounds like a spin on EXIF data, the embedded opt-in metadata that attaches information like lens type and location to an image. But Adobe says the new attribution standard will be less &#8220;brittle&#8221; and much more difficult to manipulate. The end result would have more in common with digital fingerprinting systems like the ones that identify child exploitation online than it would with EXIF.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe attribution will create a virtuous cycle,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;The more creators distribute content with proper attribution, the more consumers will expect and use that information to make judgement calls, thus minimizing the influence of bad actors and deceptive content.&#8221;</p>

Ross Houston plans on arriving in Bellator with a bang by claiming the scalp of one of the promotion’s most spectacular talents.

Undefeated former Cage Warriors welterweight champion Houston (8-0 MMA, 0-0 BMMA) signed for Bellator and has made no secret of his desire to dive straight in with the big fish of Bellator’s 170-pound division, and he’s been given his wish in the form of Michael Page (17-1 MMA, 13-1 BMMA), whose penchant for spectacular finishes has made him one of the most recognizable fighters on the roster.

Houston said he’s ready for the test, and ready to prove that he’s the better mixed martial artist when they face off in the 175-pound catchweight main event of Bellator 248, which takes place Saturday at Accor Arena in Paris, France. The event streams live on CBS Sports Network and DAZN.

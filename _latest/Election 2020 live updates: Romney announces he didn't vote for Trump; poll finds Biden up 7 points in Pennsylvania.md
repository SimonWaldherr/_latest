He has had a contentious relationship with the president, calling Trump a &#8220;phony&#8221; and a &#8220;fraud&#8221; ahead of the 2016 election and continuing to rail against the president&#8217;s rhetoric and actions on a host of issues while serving in the U.S. Senate, including on foreign policy, mail-in voting, race and the administration&#8217;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Romney was the sole Republican to vote to convict Trump on one article of impeachment earlier this year. The criticisms have drawn Trump&#8217;s ire, calling Romney a host of names on Twitter, including a &#8220;loser&#8221; and a &#8220;grandstander.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Most recently, Romney was critical of both the president and Democrats for the &#8220;hate-filled&#8221; rhetoric during this election cycle.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I have stayed quiet with the approach of the election," Romney said in a statement. "But I'm troubled by our politics, as it has moved away from spirited debate to a vile, vituperative, hate-filled morass that is unbecoming of any free nation &#8211; let alone the birthplace of modern democracy."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8212;Christal Hayes</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"><a id="gpd-1603303703297"></a>COVID stimulus update: Senate fails to pass Republicans' $500B relief plan</h2><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-elections-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Senate on Wednesday<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/21/covid-19-senate-take-up-500-billion-coronavirus-stimulus-bill/3713066001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> failed to pass a $500 billion COVID-19 stimulus package</a> as relief negotiations drag on less than two weeks before Election Day.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The bill&#160;would have given a federal boost to weekly unemployment benefits, sent $100 billion to schools, and allocated&#160;funding for testing and vaccine development.

C-SPAN indefinitely suspended its political editor, Steve Scully, on Thursday, after he admitted to lying about a hacker being behind his eyebrow-raising Twitter exchange with former President Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci.

When Trump criticized Scully last week as a “never Trumper,” the journalist asked Scaramucci on Twitter, “should I respond to Trump.”

Particularly as Scully was set to moderate the since-scrapped second presidential debate, the tweet raised questions about his impartiality.

Scully responded by claiming that his account had been hacked, as Trump likened him to disgraced former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, who used a similar false defense in his sexting selfie scandal.

Scully ultimately admitted that the hacking claim was a lie and issued a mea culpa.

“These were both errors in judgement for which I am totally responsible for,” he said. “I apologize.”

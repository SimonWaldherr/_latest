<div><p>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</p><p>Every time Brooke Shields <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/07/24/bikini-clad-brooke-shields-54-flaunts-figure-on-instagram/">shows off her fit figure</a> <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/12/30/brooke-shields-54-shows-off-ripped-body-in-tiny-bikini/">in a bikini on Instagram</a>, her fans go wild.</p>
<p>But to hear the 55-year-old actress and model tell it, mustering up the confidence to show skin on social media took some convincing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wearing those big bathing suits that had as much fabric as possible,&#8221; Shields <a href="https://people.com/style/brooke-shields-on-body-and-bikini-confidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told People</a>. &#8220;My daughters were like, &#8216;Mom, it&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8217; It was sort of seeing myself through their eyes and just celebrating things like my butt. Things I just would never want to focus on in my life. Being 55 and saying &#8216;Wait a minute, women over 50 are not done.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Continued the sexy star, &#8220;If you&#8217;re that age, especially if you are an actress, it&#8217;s like &#8216;you&#8217;ve had your career, relax,&#8217; but I think I&#8217;m just starting.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Growing up, Shields admitted she &#8220;wasn&#8217;t in touch with [her body]&#8221; and &#8220;almost didn&#8217;t want to know it existed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a model, mostly covers, so it was sort of neck up. All about the face and eyebrows. My way of approaching the subject was just not to think about it,&#8221; she recalled.</p>
<p>But with the support of her children and a body-positive personal trainer, the &#8220;Suddenly Susan&#8221; star has learned to love her shape and show it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was never skinny. I was always athletic which means you don&#8217;t fit in the sample sizes,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;My daughters say I&#8217;m curvy &#8230; I watch them celebrate it. I&#8217;m learning from them and they always say you&#8217;re better off with something that shows your body rather than a muumuu.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Of course, those awesome abs and arms don&#8217;t come easy. &#8220;Listen, I work hard at it. Every day, this summer I worked out,&#8221; Shields told People.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kind of earned my confidence. I&#8217;m still going to get the right angle, mind you. And lighting.&#8221;</p>

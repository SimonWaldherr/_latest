Apple's next major event is right around the corner on October 13, but you may not have to wait until then to find out key details about the iPhone 12 lineup.

A leaker who goes by the name "Kang" recently posted a slew of details claiming to be about Apple's next iPhones, from their pricing to their launch dates, camera specifications, and much more.

Kang is said to have a strong track record when it comes to Apple leaks. The website AppleTrack, which tracks Apple rumors and rates leakers and analysts on their accuracy, issued Kang a 97.8% accuracy rate. The leaker correctly posted that the iPhone SE would launch on April 15 for $399 earlier this year, and also accurately leaked the colors of Apple's new iPad Air before the company's September 15 event.

Kang's new leaks regarding the iPhone 12 lineup echo many of the details we've heard in the past from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and others. The leak suggests the iPhone 12 will come in four variants, including a 5.4-inch model, two 6.1-inch variants, and a 6.7-inch version, all of which are said to support 5G connectivity.

Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Pricing and colors

The 5.4-inch iPhone 12 will start at $699, according to Kang, and will reportedly be available in black, white, red, blue, and green. That would make it the same price as the iPhone 11. The 6.1-inch iPhone 12 is said to come with a $799 starting price and may be available in the same color options.

The iPhone 12 Pro could start at $999 and come in gold, silver, graphite, and blue, Kang says, also indicating that Apple may keep the pricing the same as the iPhone 11 Pro. The larger 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max will reportedly cost $1,099, like the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and is said to come in the same colors as the regular Pro.

Release dates

In terms of when the phones will launch, Kang predicts that the two 6.1-inch phones will be the first to debut. These two devices will reportedly go up for pre-order on October 16 or 17 and then become available for sale on October 23 or 24.

The so-called iPhone 12 mini is next with a reported pre-sale date of November 6 or 7 and a launch date of November 13 or 14. Last is the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max, which is said to go up for pre-order on November 13 or 14 and officially launch on November 20 or 21.

Other details

Kang also reports that the iPhone 12 mini and 6.1-inch iPhone 12 will both come with dual camera setups, while the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max will have triple cameras. Both Pro models will reportedly come with a LiDAR sensor for better performance in augmented reality apps as well.

Apple is also reportedly making its iPhone 12 lineup more durable with a ceramic front cover that should make the devices more drop resistant. Like Kuo has indicated in the past, Kang also says that the iPhone 12 family won't come with Apple's wired headphones in the box.

Apple may also launch new wireless charging accessories for the new iPhones under the MagSafe name, the magnetic power adapter it previously used for Mac computers. Apple previously filed a patent application for a new and improved version of its MagSafe charging system.

In addition to launching four new iPhones, Kang also predicts that a $99 miniature HomePod speaker will debut at the event and launch on November 16 or 17.

The iPhone 12 is expected to be a major launch for Apple, representing a redesign to the iPhone and its first smartphones to include 5G support. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives has described the launch as a "once in a decade" moment for Apple, estimating that 350 million active iPhones around the world are likely due for an upgrade.

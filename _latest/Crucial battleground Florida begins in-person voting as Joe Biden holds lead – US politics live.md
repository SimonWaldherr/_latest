</p><p>On 6 October <strong>Chad Wolf</strong>, the acting secretary of homeland security, released his department&#8217;s annual assessment of violent threats to the nation. Analysts didn&#8217;t have to dig deep into <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020_10_06_homeland-threat-assessment.pdf" class="u-underline">the assessment</a> to discover its alarming content.</p>
<p>In a foreword, Wolf wrote that he was &#8220;particularly concerned about white supremacist violent extremists who have been exceptionally lethal in their abhorrent, targeted attacks in recent years. [They] seek to force ideological change in the United States through violence, death, and destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two days later, the FBI swooped. It <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/08/six-people-charged-plot-kidnap-michigan-governor-gretchen-whitmer" class="u-underline">arrested 13 rightwing extremists</a> who had allegedly been plotting to carry out a range of attacks in Michigan, including the kidnapping of Democratic governor <strong>Gretchen Whitmer</strong>.</p>
<p>Later revelations revealed that a group of anti-government paramilitaries that included some of those arrested had also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/13/virginia-governor-ralph-northam-kidnap-plot-fbi" class="u-underline">discussed</a> kidnapping the governor of Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>The double strike, just days apart, of the threat assessment and the Michigan plot arrests marked an important moment in America&#8217;s tortured history of racist terrorism</strong>. US authorities appeared not only to have woken up finally to the extent of the white supremacist threat but were actually doing something about it.</p>
<p>As the FBI director <strong>Christopher Wray</strong> told Congress in February, &#8220;racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists&#8221; have become the &#8220;primary source of ideologically-motivated lethal incidents&#8221; in the US. The danger overshadowed the jihadist threat that has dominated the security debate since 9/11.</p>

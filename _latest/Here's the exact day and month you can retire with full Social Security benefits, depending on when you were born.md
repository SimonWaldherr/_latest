If you wait until age 70, your benefit will increase by as much as 32%.</li><li>Claiming Social Security too early could hurt your chances of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/building-wealth">building wealth</a> later in life, according to new research from <a href="https://unitedincome.com/documents/papers/RetirementSolutionHidinginPlainSight.pdf">United Income</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p>The Social Security retirement age is between 66 and 67 for nearly all of today's working Americans.</p><p>Otherwise known as full or <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/1960.html">normal retirement age</a>, it's the age a person who has worked at least 10 years can begin claiming 100% of their <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/is-social-security-taxed">Social Security</a> benefit, which is equal to an average of monthly wages for their 35 highest-earning years, adjusted for inflation. The <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/2019%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">average benefit</a> for Social Security recipients is $1,420 a month, according to the Social Security Administration.</p><p>Americans born in 1960 or later &#8212; age 59 or younger in 2019 &#8212; can retire with full Social Security benefits at age 67. For Americans born before 1960, the full retirement age is between 66 and 67 years, as follows:</p><ul><li>Born between 1943 and 1954: age 66</li><li>Born in 1955: age 66 and two months</li><li>Born in 1956: age 66 and four months</li><li>Born in 1957: age 66 and six months</li><li>Born in 1958: age 66 and eight months</li><li>Born in 1959: age 66 and 10 months.</li></ul><p class="insider-raw-embed"></p><p>Anyone who qualifies for a Social Security benefit can opt to claim it as early as age 62, regardless of whether they've left work or not. However, claiming that early reduces the payout to 75% of the full benefit if born before 1960 and 70% of the full benefit if born in 1960 or later.</p><p>Age 70 is the latest it makes sense to claim Social Security benefits. With each 12-month period that benefits are delayed beyond a person's full retirement age (up to age 70), their benefit increases by up to 8% for a maximum of either 24% for those born in 1960 or later or 32% for those born before 1960.</p><p>Let's say John, who was born in 1955, is in good health and enjoys his job. John's full retirement age is&#160;<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/1955-delay.html">exactly 66 and two months</a>, at which point he can claim 100% of his monthly Social Security benefit of $1,420 (<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/2019%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">the 2019 average benefit</a>). John decides to continue working for a few more years, until his 69th birthday, and delays his benefit.</p><p>By the time John claims his Social Security benefit at 69, his monthly payout will be $1,742,&#160;<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/1955-delay.html">122.7%</a>&#160;of his full retirement-age benefit. By delaying, John increased his monthly Social Security income by about $320.

For those in good health or with a greater chance of longevity, it may be worth it to hold out.</p><p>New <a href="https://unitedincome.com/documents/papers/RetirementSolutionHidinginPlainSight.pdf">research from United Income</a> found that elderly poverty could be cut in half if every retiree claimed Social Security at the "financially optimal time." The report said retirees stood to lose a collective $2.1 trillion in wealth, or about $68,000 per household, because they chose to claim Social Security benefits at the wrong time, which, for many, is before their full retirement age.&#160;</p><p>But new reports show the Social Security trust will be <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/Downloads/TR2019.pdf">underfunded as soon as next year</a>, leading <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/article/retirement/T051-C032-S014-as-a-30-something-can-you-count-on-social-security.html">some experts to suggest</a> workers shouldn't rely on Social Security payments when planning for retirement.&#160;</p>

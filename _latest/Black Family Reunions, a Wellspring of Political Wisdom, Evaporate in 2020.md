  Black Family Reunions, a Wellspring of Political Wisdom, Evaporate in 2020 
description: > 
  At a time when family reunions would have been a timely way to honor diaspora-wide histories of surviving racialized violence, the coronavirus, a disease that disproportionately affects Black Americans, has prevented many of them from happening.This could have subtle but meaningful political implications, as Black Americans’ voting rights are increasingly under attack.Informed by the sacrifices that previous generations of the family made to be able to exercise the right to vote, Ms. Griggs uses the family’s newsletter to record family history and mark progress in real time.This includes published interviews conducted between members of the family history team and relatives of all ages, who share their voting experiences and political views.Darrell Sheppard, an 18-year-old member of the family — which calls itself the Gillyard-Johnson-Mahoney family — credited his grandmother with helping him prepare to vote in his first presidential election this November.

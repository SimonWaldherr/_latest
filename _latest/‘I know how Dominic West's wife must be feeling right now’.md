Marriages can be messy, but you think you have one another’s backs. You think you know them. That’s why, when they act so out of character, your whole belief system is rocked. To suddenly see that person as a stranger, doing strange things in a strange place with a strange person, is upending to say the least.

For landscape gardener FitzGerald, 49, this is the man who has been in love with her since they were at Trinity College together, the man she married in 2010 and is the father of her four young children, aged between seven and 13. The man with whom she talks finances and family and future plans.

She must have found it hard to reconcile that person with the man pictured in Rome alongside his 31-year-old co-star in The Pursuit of Love, riding a scooter. His wedding ring and sense of propriety MIA.

Whatever the truth – even if there is a perfectly innocent explanation – the public speculation will feel humiliating. The images of them jumping out from her from her phone screen like a million lacerating shards.

After the pictures emerged, West, 50, swiftly returned home and a photocall saw the couple put on a public display of togetherness outside their Wiltshire home, handing a note to the press that read: “Our marriage is strong and we’re very much together.”

Eagle-eyed observers noted that FitzGerald clutched a screwed-up tissue in the palm of one hand. The family is reportedly now retreating to FitzGerald’s 18-bedroom family seat – Glin Castle, in Co Limerick – which she and West have taken on the monumental task of renovating, with the aim of turning it into a venue. The couple married on the 400-acre estate, following FitzGerald’s divorce from the 7th Earl of Durham.

The Anglo-Irish aristocrat was initially said, by one confidante, to have been “devastated” when the photographs of her husband alongside James appeared this week. That message has now shifted in tone, with friends describing her as “no nonsense,” “direct” and insisting that “Catherine will make her feelings on the episode perfectly clear in private”... she doesn’t “take any c---”.

For his part, West has previously described his wife as “beautiful, intelligent and spectacularly disdainful.”

Perhaps FitzGerald, aristocrat that she is, thinks monogamy is for the bourgeoisie with their worries about mortgage payments and such like. Maybe she and West have an agreement. Who knows?

In a 2016 interview – that is now being widely circulated online – West said: “I think women should be more indulgent of affairs. I really do… It’s daft to kick someone out over a fling, isn’t it? Everyone should turn a blind eye to men’s behaviour between the ages of 40 and 50. Let it all blow over.”

That, as young people say, “hasn’t aged well”.

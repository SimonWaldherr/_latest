A day after Cam Newton and Stephon Gilmore returned from the COVID-19 list to practice, the New England Patriots had to pause activities because of coronavirus concerns once again.

The Patriots canceled Friday’s practice and closed Gillette Stadium after another positive COVID-19 test. The team also had a second positive test that was yet to be confirmed.

The Patriots released a short statement that read, “Patriots practice and media availability today has been cancelled. No further information is available at this time.”

On Sunday, the Patriots are scheduled to play the Denver Broncos, who they were supposed to originally face Oct. 10. ESPN reported that the Broncos were told to prepare to fly into New England and play at Gillette Stadium on Sunday.

According to the NFL Network, the Patriots placed offensive lineman James Ferentz on the COVID-19/Reserve list. Ferentz was at practice on Thursday. On Wednesday, however, he was listed as “did not participate” with a non-injury on the team’s practice report the day before.

Ferentz, 31, started at center in Kansas City with David Andrews on the injured reserve. He becomes the fifth Patriots player to land on the NFL’s Covid-19/Reserve list. With Ferentz out, the Pats could move Joe Thuney to center, where he started in Week 3.

After Gilmore and practice squad defensive lineman Billy Murray also tested positive, the team’s game against the Broncos was moved to Monday night – a similar accommodation that followed Newton’s positive test on Oct. 3 that led to the Patriots’ contest against the Kansas City Chiefs moving back one day to a Monday evening matchup.

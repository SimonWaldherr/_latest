<div><p>Of all the things that humanity builds from concrete or stone, there are few structures that influence the surface of Earth quite as profoundly as a dam.&#160;</p>

<p>By blocking the flow of a river, we dare to defy gravity&#8217;s pull on water from mountain to estuary &#8211; and influence the trajectory of geology itself. A dam does so much more than submerge a valley to create a reservoir: it transforms a river&#8217;s natural course, accruing silt and sediment at an artificial barrier, and dampening water&#8217;s erosional force downstream.</p>

<p>Their vertiginous walls, striking shapes and deep foundations will also leave a unique archaeological imprint. Some of these engineered monoliths are so enormous that they may be preserved for millennia. &#160;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dams can also bring deep changes for the people who live nearby, and the generations that follow them. When a government in a distant capital decides to exploit its rivers, destruction of local homes, farmland and livelihoods often follows.&#160;For example, while the rest of the world focused on Covid-19 earlier this year, an entire ancient town in Turkey was lost to rising reservoir waters. Long after we are gone, future archaeologists will study such submerged settlements and may wonder why we let them go for the sake of short-term politics and energy demand.</p>

<p>The effects can be felt a long way from home, too. Damming rivers that wind through continents, like the Nile in Africa, can withhold valuable water and power from countries downstream, forever changing the trajectories of those nations.</p>

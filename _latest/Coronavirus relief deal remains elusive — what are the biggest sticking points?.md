"Go big or go home, I said it yesterday."</p><p>The Trump administration's latest $1.8 trillion proposal -- its largest yet --&#160;drew criticism from both Republicans and Democrats last week, dimming the odds of another round of emergency aid before the Nov. 3 election.&#160;It was expected to include a second round of direct payments of up to $1,200 for adults and $1,000 for children; expanded unemployment benefits at $400 per week and additional funding for state and local governments.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/biden-pledges-to-undo-trumps-tax-cuts-a-lot-of-you-may-not-like-that" target="_blank">BIDEN PLEDGES TO ROLL BACK TRUMP'S TAX CUTS: 'A LOT OF YOU MAY NOT LIKE THAT'</a></strong></p><p>Although Democrats and Republicans broadly agree that another bill is necessary to aid the economy's recovery, they sharply disagree over the size and scope of it.

  Coronavirus latest news: Structural racism 'not a reasonable explanation' for BAME Covid risk, says government adviser 
description: > 
  Structural racism is “not a reasonable explanation" for the greater risk of death BAME people face from Covid-19, a Government adviser has said.Dr Raghib Ali, of the University of Cambridge, is the newly appointed adviser to the Government on Covid-19 and ethnicity.“If structural racism was an important problem — I'm not saying it doesn't exist — but if it was an important problem in health outcomes, then you'd expect that to be reflected not just in Covid but in other outcomes as well,” Dr Ali said.He made the comments ahead of the release of the first quarterly report on coronavirus disparities, led by the government's Race Disparity Unit and Kemi Badenoch, the Minister for Equalities.“Once you take into account those risk factors, that takes into account most of the excess risk that we saw,” he said, but added there was still a “small amount” of unexplained excess risk which needs further investigation.

<p>Structural racism is &#8220;not a reasonable explanation" for the greater risk of death BAME people face from Covid-19, a Government adviser has said.</p>
<p>Dr Raghib Ali, of the University of Cambridge, is the newly appointed adviser to the Government on Covid-19 and ethnicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;If structural racism was an important problem &#8212; I'm not saying it doesn't exist &#8212; but if it was an important problem in health outcomes, then you'd expect that to be reflected not just in Covid but in other outcomes as well,&#8221; Dr Ali said.</p>
<p>He made the comments ahead of the release of the first quarterly report on coronavirus disparities, led by the government's Race Disparity Unit and Kemi Badenoch,&#160;the Minister for Equalities.</p>
<p>Speaking on the BBC Radio 4&#8217;s Today programme, Dr Ali said there were other risk factors which can explain the difference in the deaths rates, such as where you live, your job, the type of housing you live in and whether your household is multi-generational.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you take into account those risk factors, that takes into account most of the excess risk that we saw,&#8221; he said, but added there was still a &#8220;small amount&#8221; of unexplained excess risk which needs further investigation.</p>

Northern leaders have said they "cannot accept" the financial package offered by the Government that will pay two-thirds of the wages of workers at businesses forced to close by local lockdown measures.

Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said that the current financial package would "surrender our residents to hardship and our businesses to potential failure or collapse, and we are not prepared to do that".

Mr Burnham added that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had told local leaders that the package was "final and non-negotiable". But the mayor said the package suggested that hospitality workers were "second-class citizens", given that national furlough was much higher at 80 per cent.

Steve Rotheram, the mayor of Liverpool City region, echoed the comments and said that "imposing new restrictions without providing adequate Government support is simply not acceptable".

The leaders have written to MPs that represent areas in the north of England, asking them to back their message and "support their constituents".

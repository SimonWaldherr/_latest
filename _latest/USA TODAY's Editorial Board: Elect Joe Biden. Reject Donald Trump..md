He surely would not have become a superspreader of coronavirus misinformation. Back in January, in a column for USA TODAY, the former vice president warned that the novel virus emerging in China &#8220;will get worse before it gets better,&#8221; and that Trump is &#8220;the worst possible person to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/01/27/coronavirus-donald-trump-made-us-less-prepared-joe-biden-column/4581710002/" target="_blank">lead our country through a global health challenge</a>.&#8221; During the campaign, Biden has modeled mask wearing and other public health recommendations that Trump has flouted while downplaying the threat.

Policy differences, however, are not the reason behind our first-ever presidential endorsement. Diverse views, even ones we think are wrongheaded, are a staple of American politics and something to celebrate.</p><p>If this were a choice between two capable major party nominees who happened to have opposing ideas, we wouldn&#8217;t choose sides. Different voters have different concerns. But this is not a normal election, and these are not normal times. This year, character, competence and credibility are on the ballot. Given Trump&#8217;s refusal to guarantee a peaceful transfer of power if he loses, so, too, is the future of America's&#160;democracy.</p><p>For nearly four decades, the Editorial Board has stood for certain core values: truth, accountability, civility in public discourse, opposition to racism, common-ground solutions to the nation&#8217;s problems, and steadfast support for First Amendment rights. These aren&#8217;t partisan issues, or at least they shouldn&#8217;t be.</p><p>Donald Trump has trampled each of these principles, making&#160;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/13/president-trump-has-made-more-than-20000-false-or-misleading-claims/" target="_blank">more than 20,000 false or misleading statements</a>, ducking responsibility for his actions, spewing&#160;streams of invective&#160;at his critics, trafficking in racial fearmongering, governing more as the leader of the red states than of the United States, and relentlessly attacking the free press.</p><p>Everything about Biden&#8217;s nearly half-century political career suggests he would do a far better job of respecting these values. &#8220;We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country, the spirit of being able to work with one another,&#8221; the Democratic nominee said in a recent speech&#160;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-gettysburg-campaign-speech-transcript-october-6" target="_blank">in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a>.</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/indepth-static-assets/uploads/master/5919435002/a1b6aec1-883e-4105-8dd4-1b5949756fc8-electionstars4.jpg" alt="Working-class roots"><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">Working-class roots</h2><p>Biden is a worthy antidote to Trump&#8217;s unbounded narcissism and chronic chaos.

Ask yourself: Can you imagine Joe Biden denigrating servicemembers as losers? Cozying&#160;up to autocrats abroad? Shaking down a foreign leader for dirt on a political opponent?</p><p>All politicians, of course, have flaws, and Biden is no exception.&#160;He <a href="https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=b000444" target="_blank">turns 78 next month</a>&#160;and, like the November foliage in New England, is somewhat past peak.</p><p>For someone billed as a foreign policy expert, he managed to be wrong about both the Persian Gulf War&#160;(he <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/sep/01/lindsey-graham/only-as-a-last-resort/" target="_blank">opposed the 1991 effort to expel Saddam Hussein</a>&#8217;s forces from Kuwait) <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/09/14/joe-biden-iraq-record-critics-overlook-contributions-column/5786368002/" target="_blank">and the Iraq War</a> (he supported the 2003 U.S. invasion, which turned into a debacle). His&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/06/anita-hill-endorses-joe-biden/5735556002/" target="_blank">handling of Anita Hill&#8217;s sexual harassment claim</a> against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991,&#160;when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,&#160;has not aged well. He is capable of cringeworthy gaffes, and his sentences can wander off into uncharted territory.</p><p>Nevertheless, Biden is an experienced hand with working-class roots&#160;who understands the American dream. He knows the levers of power and how to wield them. He has a history of working across the aisle on such issues as health care, racial justice and the environment. He has the knowledge&#160;and the personality to begin repairing America&#8217;s tattered reputation around the world.</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/indepth-static-assets/uploads/master/5919435002/a1b6aec1-883e-4105-8dd4-1b5949756fc8-electionstars4.jpg" alt="An extraordinary moment"><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">An extraordinary moment</h2><p>Maybe you&#8217;ve heard Republican operatives and commentators trying to paint Biden as a puppet of far-left radicals. But if he was able to resist such unaffordable progressive ideas as "Medicare for All" and the "Green New Deal" during the heat of the Democratic primaries, it is hard to envision&#160;him embracing them once he is&#160;in the White House.</p><p>Biden is well positioned to repair the wreckage Trump has made of the federal government, from the foreign service to the science agencies Trump has tried to politicize. As vice president in the Obama administration, Biden played a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/04/08/biden-get-coronavirus-relief-to-families-small-business-column/2963385001/" target="_blank">central role in the last economic recovery</a> and is equipped to handle another one.</p><p>Even before the pandemic struck, Trump <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/08/25/republican-national-convention-speakers-sell-trump-economic-myth-column/5627796002/" target="_blank">did no better</a> than the Obama-Biden administration&#160;on job creation, the stock market and economic growth. (Remember his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-turmoil-or-triumph-donald-trump-stands-alone/2016/04/02/8c0619b6-f8d6-11e5-a3ce-f06b5ba21f33_story.html?utm_term=.d6b42cbf9b8c" target="_blank">promise</a> to pay off the national debt in eight years? It's <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny" target="_blank">now $27 trillion</a>, up more than $7 trillion from four years ago.)&#160;Biden knows that&#160;the recovery process will require, first and foremost, a comprehensive national response to the COVID-19 crisis that has upended Americans&#8217; lives and left large sectors of the economy reeling.&#160;</p><p>This extraordinary moment in the history of our nation requires an extraordinary response. With his plans, his personnel picks, his experience and his humanity, Joe Biden can help lead the United States out of this morass and into the future.&#160;Your vote can help make that happen.</p><p>Will this endorsement have any effect on what you read about the presidential campaign in USA TODAY&#8217;s news reports? No. Will it cause the Editorial Board to pull its punches if Biden were to become president? Also no.</p><p>We may&#160;never endorse a presidential nominee again.

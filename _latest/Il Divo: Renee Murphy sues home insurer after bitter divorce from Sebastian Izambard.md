'Forced' into a 'mobile home park': Renee Izambard (nee Murphy) with her estranged husband, the suave Il Divo opera singer Sebastien Izambard

An Il Divo opera singer's estranged Australian wife claims she was 'forced' to live in a caravan park after their $US12.95million Malibu mansion burned down in a wildfire days just after she filed for divorce.

Details of one-time Sydney Sony Music executive Renee Izambard's new life after her messy split with French tenor Sebastien Izambard were laid bare in a lawsuit filed with a Californian court this week.

Ms Izambard (nee Murphy) is suing insurer State Farm, her estranged husband, an insurance agent and up to 20 others, over an allegedly 'inadequate' policy which covered the couple's destroyed former Malibu home.

Their five bedroom residence - described as a 'no expense spared ... oasis' - and its two guest houses went up in flames on November 8, 2018 during California's devastating Woolsey wildfire, which claimed three lives and 1600 structures.

Only the Izambards' tennis court was left unscathed by the flames.

In Ms Izambard's complaint, filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday, lawyer Devin A. McRae describes the ex-publicist's home as a 'stunning French noveau farmhouse style compound' with views of the Pacific Ocean, modern fixtures and 'heightened privacy.'

But life after the blaze allegedly saw Ms Izambard 'forced' to shack up in 'sub-standard' lodgings with her three children - at a caravan park, the complaint said.

Ms Izambard alleged that a year after the home burned down, the insurer stopped paying her monthly rent.

At the same time, she claimed State Farm continued to pay her husband between $15,000 and $20,000 from December 2019 through to July 2020.

Ms Izambard claimed that under her policy an insurer must 'cover the necessary increase in cost to (the insured) to maintain (the insured's) standard of living'.

For Ms Izambard, that involved 'a residence of like kind and quality to the Property - a multi-acre, ocean view compound with over 8,000 square feet of residential living space.

'Comparable properties to Ms Izambard's Property rented for at least $150,000 per month in Malibu during November 2018 and forward time period,' the complaint said.

Supergroup singer Izambard used to dedicate songs to Ms Murphy, the mother of his three children. They met while the 'suave Frenchman' was touring Australia in 2004

The payments' alleged termination led Ms Izambard to be 'forced to live in sub-standard lodgings which she paid for out of her own pocket while caring for her three additional needs children,' the complaint said.

Ms Izambard claimed in the complaint that she had to move into a 'mobile home park' as it was 'the only property she could afford'.

State Farm later backtracked after she retained a lawyer and retroactively paid her a lump sum equivalent of $19,600 per month, the complaint claimed.

But the lawsuit said 'this was too little, too late, as Ms Izambard had already been forced to move into another, cheaper mobile home.'

Her lawsuit - which seek all policy benefits from the insurer as well as damages - was filed in court on Monday.

Ms Izambard also seeks damages from her ex-husband, their insurance agent and others named only as 'Does 1 to 20'. The complaint includes a demand for a jury trial.

Life with Il Divo lover

Ms Izambard found love with the opera supergroup singer in the mid-2000s, with their whirlwind romance sparking intense interest.

She had famously fallen for the charms of the touring tenor when he travelled to Sydney, while she was working as a senior publicist for Sony DMG.

Il Divo has sold more than 35 million albums worldwide since the group were formed by music producer Simon Cowell. Izambard, above, in Hollywood

Their relationship culminated in a French castle wedding, three children and a luxurious life split between homes in California, Paris and London.

Ms Murphy reared the kids while her tenor husband toured the world for Il Divo, the operatic supergroup the created by Simon Cowell, which has sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.

But Ms Izambard confirmed in a statement to Daily Mail Australia last year that their marriage had collapsed.

'I filed for divorce, just days before our home and contents were completely destroyed by the 2018 Californian wildfires,' she said.

'I've been diagnosed with a life changing illness, mostly caring alone for our three children.

'Being a very private person, speaking out publicly is hard but it's time however, I need to fight for freedom and peace for my children and I.'

Ms Izambard's court filing this week said the pair's divorce proceedings are still pending.

Sebastien Izambard has never publicly commented on his divorce.

Since his marriage collapse, the singer has since been linked to another glamorous Malibu woman, Courtney Seashols.

Her lawyer, Mr McRae, has previously represented the likes of Beverley Hills 90210 actress Shannen Doherty, who has previously filed a lawsuit against the State Farm.

State Farm spokesman Sevag Sarkissian said the insurer is yet to be served with the litigation 'so we are unaware of the particulars of what is alleged.

'We strive to handle all of our claims in a fair, prompt and courteous way.'

Mr Izambard was approached for comment and Ms Izambard declined to comment as the case is before a court.

 <p>Among them, there is speculation that Ri is suffering from some kind of health issue, the website reported.</p> <p>However, it is not the leading theory.</p> <p>There is also speculation that she is caring for Kim's aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, who was pictured with the couple at the Lunar New Year Event in January.</p> <p>The leader's aunt, who is the younger sister of Kim Jong-il, is said to be in poor health.</p> <p>Daily NK reported: "This rumour is the most prevalent in the society given that it has been spread by people with 'quick access to information'.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>It is said that Kim's "affection" for his aunt grew after he executed her husband, and he treats her as a "family elder" and is making sure she is "specially cared for".</p> <p>The third rumour is Ri is focusing on the education of the couple's daughter, who was reportedly born in 2013 and would now be of primary school age.</p> <p>"This would only be true, however, if Ju-ae started school normally like other children," Daily NK reported.</p> <p>"Some North Koreans reportedly believe that Ri, as Ju-ae&#8217;s mother, would naturally manage her daughter&#8217;s education-related activities, including those activities that focus on her role as the daughter of the country&#8217;s leader."</p>

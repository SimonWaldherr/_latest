But we hear his purported love interest is taken.</p>
<p>Ehrich has been posting pics of himself with former &#8220;American Idol&#8221; contestant Sonika Vaid, but sources told Page Six it&#8217;s smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to make it look like he&#8217;s moving on with another woman, but they&#8217;re not dating. She&#8217;s in a full relationship and lives with her boyfriend,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>Lovato <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/12/twitter-reacts-to-crying-max-ehrich-pics-after-demi-lovato-split/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called off her brief engagement to Ehrich</a> last month. His photos with Vaid included a screenshot of the duo on a FaceTime call. But &#8220;he&#8217;s trying to get back at Demi and make her jealous. It&#8217;s all phony,&#8221; the source said.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re told Vaid is dating a real estate agent who works for &#8220;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&#8221; presence Mauricio Umansky&#8217;s firm.</p>

News&#8221; of Ehrich:</a> &#8220;I met Max recently at dinner with mutual friends. It was a fun night and we all got to hang out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/20/demi-lovato-has-been-chatting-with-aliens-since-max-ehrich-breakup/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lovato has moved on &#8212; with aliens!</a> She recently hit the desert with UFO expert Dr. Steven Greer and his team, &#8220;initiating peaceful contact with ET civilizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>A rep for Ehrich did not comment.</p>

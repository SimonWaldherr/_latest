Gov. Andrew Cuomo dished out a playful dig at his daughter’s boyfriend at the dinner table Sunday night.

“Sunday dinner — Check,’’ the governor wrote in a tweet above a photo of him and his three daughters at the table.

“Meatballs — Check.

“The Boyfriend — ?”

The cutesy jab was just a joke, a Cuomo spokesman later told The Post.

“We like the boyfriend,’’ the rep said, quoting his boss.

The governor was apparently tweaking oldest daughter Mariah’s Norwegian beau, Tellef Lundevall.

<p>One of the top African American executives in Hollywood, Channing Dungey, was named chairman of the Warner Bros. Television Group on Monday. </p>   <p>She will replace <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/news/press-releases/wbtvg-chairman-tv-industry-legend-peter-roth-step-down-2021">Peter Roth</a> who is stepping down early next year after running the television group for more than two decades. </p>   <p>Dungey previously served in executive roles at ABC and most recently Netflix where she was the streaming giant's Vice President Original Content and Head of Drama. </p>   <p>She left her role at <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/channing-dungey-departs-netflix">Netflix on Oct. 9</a>.   </p>   <p>While at ABC, she was named President of ABC Entertainment, making her the first Black executive to run an entertainment programming division at a major network. </p>   <p>One of her more controversial decisions while at ABC was greenlighting the reboot of Roseanne even after some critics noted the star, Rosanne Barr, had several racist social media posts. </p>   <p>After a successful return to prime time in 2018, the network quickly ordered 13 more episodes just days after its March 27 premiere. </p>   <p>But two months later, ABC <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/29/615211939/abc-cancels-roseanne-after-abhorrent-twitter-rant-from-its-star">abruptly cancelled the show</a> after incendiary tweets from Barr about former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarret in which she said, if "muslim brotherhood &amp; planet of the apes had a baby=vj."  </p>   
    

    <p id="ad-backstage-Arts___Life_Television" class="ad-backstage"></p>

   <p>Dungey issued a one-sentence statement on the matter. </p>   <p>"Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show," she said. </p>   <p>The tweet was later deleted and Barr apologized "<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-television-roseanne/tv-show-roseanne-abruptly-canceled-after-stars-racist-tweet-sparks-furor-idUSKCN1IU2E0">for making a bad joke</a>." She also said the sedative Ambien <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/30/615421269/roseanne-barr-says-ambien-played-role-in-racist-tweet-that-spiked-her-shows-rebo">played a role in her tweet</a>. </p>   <p>Most of the cast returned without Barr and The Connors is still featured in ABC's prime time programming. </p>   <p>Dungey also oversaw the network's relaunch of American Idol (which had previously aired on Fox) and created new series that included A Million Little Things, The Rookie and The Good Doctor.</p>   <p class="contributors-text">NPR TV Critic Eric Deggans contributed to this report.</p>

Hope is believing in the face of difficulty that we can overcome and get a better world,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;And so, I&#8217;ve never lost hope over these last four years. I&#8217;ve been mad. I&#8217;ve been frustrated, but I haven&#8217;t lost hope, and the reason is because I never expected progress to move directly in a straight line.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The conversation with local Black leaders in an area of Philadelphia still facing deep racial injustices was the former president&#8217;s first in-person campaign event of the 2020 election. Obama spoke to the men about the importance of engaging young people in voting and government.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;If you don&#8217;t vote, then you are not at the table and then stuff is done to you,&#8221; Obama said.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">He urged them not to allow the setbacks of the past four years to discourage them but warned that the country can&#8217;t afford another four years like these.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;What we&#8217;ve seen over the last four years &#8212; with my election, we probably got over-optimistic about how much change had happened in the country,&#8221; Obama said, &#8220;but that change was real, and there was pushback &#8212; and that was real, too.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;The test of our strength as a people is to push through that onto the next stage. We are resilient and strong enough to push through what we&#8217;ve seen these past four years,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford another four years of this &#8230; you go so far backward that it becomes really hard to dig yourself out of that hole.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Obama did not mention Trump by name and took only one direct swing at his successor&#8217;s handling of the coronavirus.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;The pandemic would have been tough for any president,&#8221; Obama acknowledged. But he also stressed &#8220;the degree of incompetence and misinformation, the number of people who might not have died if we&#8217;d have done the basics.&#8221;</p></div>

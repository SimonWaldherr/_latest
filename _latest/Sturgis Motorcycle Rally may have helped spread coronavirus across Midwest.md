  Sturgis Motorcycle Rally may have helped spread coronavirus across Midwest 
description: > 
  The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota in mid-August may have directly led to a spike in cases of Covid-19 across five states.Within weeks of the Sturgis rally, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota, and Montana were leading the surge in new coronavirus cases.Unlike most other states, South Dakota imposed no restrictions on the number of people allowed to congregate, making the Sturgis rally the largest gathering of people in the US, possibly in the world, during the pandemic.South Dakota saw its seven-day rolling average number of cases rise from 84 on 6 August to 214 of 27 August.Governor Kristi Noem echoed Donald Trump by saying that the increase in cases was as a result of an increase in testing.

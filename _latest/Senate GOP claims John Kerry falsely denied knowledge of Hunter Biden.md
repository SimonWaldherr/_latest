John Kerry “falsely claimed” that he didn’t know Joe Biden’s son was serving on the board of a controversial Ukrainian energy company when Kerry was secretary of state, US Senate Republicans alleged in a report released Wednesday.

The report cites Kerry’s answers last year to a reporter’s questions about Hunter Biden and the Burisma natural gas company following a campaign appearance with Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden.

“I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No,” Kerry said, according to an account posted on Twitter at the time.

When pressed further, Kerry — who served with Joe Biden under former President Barack Obama — doubled down on his denial.

“What would I know about any no. Why would I know about any company or any individual? No. The answer is no. No communication. No nothing,” he said.

Kerry made the remarks in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Dec. 8, 2019, three days after endorsing Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary.

But in a section of the report titled “Secretary of State John Kerry falsely claimed he had no knowledge about Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board,” Senate Republican staffers wrote that various records “suggest that Kerry did, in fact, know about Hunter Biden and Burisma.”

The report says that on May 13, 2014 — one day after Hunter Biden joined the Burisma board — Kerry’s stepson, Chris Heinz, emailed Kerry’s chief of staff to inform him of the development.

Heinz, who was Hunter Biden’s business partner, also wanted to “distance himself” from the decision, according to the report.

“Moreover, in May 2014, Secretary Kerry’s chief of staff, David Wade, briefed him about press inquiries specifically relating to Heinz, Hunter Biden, and Burisma,” the report says.

“Separately, State Department officials wrote that they sent the secretary articles with the headlines ‘Biden’s son joins Ukrainian gas company’s board,’ ‘Biden’s son joins Ukrainian gas producer board,’ and ‘White House says no issue with Biden’s son, Ukraine gas company.'”

A Kerry spokesperson didn’t deny the report’s allegations but said Kerry “thinks this is a fraudulent issue aimed at distracting from the fact that Donald Trump is so afraid of Joe Biden that he went and got himself impeached.”

“When asked last year by NBC, six years after the initial story ran, Secretary Kerry accurately conveyed that he did not have any inside knowledge of the details of [Hunter] Biden’s role with Burisma before it became public or ever since, nor was he ever asked to do anything for Burisma,” the spokesperson said.

“In 2014, he was quickly given a heads up by his staff about initial media reports and all he’s ever heard about this issue ever since has been through media reports and right wing desperation to create an issue where one doesn’t exist.”

<div><p>House prices jumped by 2.5pc in the 12 months to the end of August&#160;as the post-lockdown property boom pushed&#160;up the cost of property, official figures showed.</p>
<p>The August figure was a large increase from the 2.1pc rise witnessed in July, the Office for National Statistics said, as deals that were held back during lockdown completed and bumped up property prices.</p>
<p>The average house price in Britain reached a new high in the summer month, hitting &#163;239,000. This was &#163;6,000 higher than August 2019.</p>
<p>Prices jumped by 0.5pc during the month, on a seasonally adjusted basis. This was&#160;a shift from July when monthly prices fell by 0.5pc.</p>
<p>The outlook for autumn prices is strong with the number of transactions for residential properties rising 21.3pc during August, according to HM Revenue &amp; Customs' provisional&#160;estimate.</p>
<p>As sales take several months to complete, the data does not yet show the&#160;impact of the stamp duty holiday&#160;that was announced in July. There were 98,010 completed transactions in September, according to HMRC. This was down 0.7pc compared with September 2019 but&#160;showed the sector had fully recovered from the spring market shutdown.</p>
<p>Lucian Cook, of Savills estate agents, said: &#8220;Concerns over the underlying economic backdrop have essentially been trumped by an increased desire to move among people who have reassessed their housing needs given the experience of lockdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stamp duty holiday has also fired up existing homeowners to move up the property ladder into bigger homes, said Mr Cook.</p>

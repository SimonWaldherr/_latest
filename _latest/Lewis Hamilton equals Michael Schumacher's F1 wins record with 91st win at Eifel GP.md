Lewis Hamilton has made history after matching Michael Schumacher's Formula One victory record by winning the Eifel Grand Prix.

The British driver started second at the Nurburgring but assumed control of the race on lap 13 when Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas slid off the road.

Despite a late safety car, Hamilton kept his cool to cross the line 4.4 seconds clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen and claim the 91st win of his remarkable career, 14 years and 10 days after Schumacher's final grand prix triumph in China.

Hamilton also moved 69 points clear of Bottas, who retired from the race with an engine failure, in his quest for a record-equalling seventh world championship. Daniel Ricciardo took the final podium position for Renault.

Hamilton, 35, was denied the landmark victory at his first attempt in Russia after he was penalised by the stewards. And when pole-sitter Bottas held his nerve to keep the six-time world champion at bay through the opening two bends it looked as though Hamilton's drive into the history books would be put on hold.

But, with just 13 of the 60 laps on the board, Bottas locked his front-right tyre under braking for the first corner, allowing Hamilton to sweep around the outside of the Finn at the following left-hander.

Five laps later, Bottas was forced to park his Mercedes with an engine failure and despite Verstappen again outperforming his Red Bull machinery to keep Hamilton on his toes, and a safety car deployed with only 15 laps to run, it proved to be a straightforward triumph for the Stevenage-born racer.

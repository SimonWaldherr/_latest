Kevin Rooney is headed across the river.

The former Devils’ fourth-liner signed a two-year deal Friday with the Rangers that carries a $750,000 cap hit. During his first three years in New Jersey, Rooney spent a majority of his time with the team’s AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Devils.

In 2019-20, Rooney collected four goals and five assists in 49 games with the Devils. The 27-year-old has appeared in 95 NHL games in the last four seasons, posting 10 goals and 9 assists.

Rooney adds some depth to the Rangers group of centers, bringing a gritty style of play. He could compete for a fourth-line role. The Rangers also need a forward who meet exposure requirements for the Seattle Kraken expansion draft.

The Rangers also signed center Colin Blackwell to a two-year deal Friday. The first year is a two-way contract at $700,000 and $350,000 while the second year is a one-way at $750,000, according to TSN. Blackwell, who appeared in 33 NHL games with the Nashville Predators the last two seasons, recorded three goals and seven assists in 27 games in 2019-20.

As Henrik Lundqvist signed in Washington, the Rangers added 31-year-old goalie Keith Kinkaid to a two-year deal at a cap hit of $875,000. Kinkaid spent the first six seasons of his NHL career with the Devils before he was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets in February 2019. He never made an appearance in net for Columbus and signed as a free agent with the Montreal Canadiens in July 2019. In 2019-20, Kinkaid made five starts and posted a 1-1 record with a .875 save percentage.

The Rangers also reached an agreement with restricted free agent Brandon Crawley on Friday. The 23-year-old defenseman split the 2019-20 season between the team’s AHL affiliate in Hartford and the ECHL’s Maine Mariners. Crawley posted two goals and 10 assists with 36 penalty minutes in 38 games with the Mariners, while he skated in nine AHL games with the Wolf Pack this past season.

The Post’s Larry Brooks reported Friday that the Rangers agreed to a one-year deal with defenseman Jack Johnson worth $1.15 million. The 33-year-old Johnson was placed on unconditional waivers by the Penguins earlier this week for purpose of buying out he remaining three years on his contract. Johnson cleared waivers, allowing him to become a free agent.

Johnson posted three goals and eight assists in 67 games with the Penguins in 2019-20. In two seasons in Pittsburgh, Johnson accumulated four goals and 20 assists. He previously was with the Columbus Blue Jackets for seven seasons, joining the club five years after current Rangers president John Davidson took over as team president in Columbus in 2006.

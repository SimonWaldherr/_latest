  Klopp praises Gomez and Fabinho but warns his players 'there is a lot to improve' after Ajax win 
description: > 
  Jurgen Klopp hailed Liverpool's battling qualities that enabled them to emerge from a 'pressure situation' in Amsterdam with a confidence restoring victory.The highlight of his display came just before half-time, when he acrobatically scooped Dusan Tadic's lob off the line.Ajax were a nuisance throughout and they came close to grabbing an equaliser when Davy Klaassen hit a post early in the second period.'The clean sheet is one information but we could have done better.I'm not surprised Fabinho plays in the position, otherwise I would have thought about a different solution.

Yes,' said Klopp. 'It (a clean sheet) is huge but we are not dumb enough to think we didn't need a bit of luck as Fabinho needed to make a proper stretch to get that ball from the line and they hit the post.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The clean sheet is one information but we could have done better. I don't care in the moment. We wanted to win the game and we have done that but now we don't hang the clean sheet too high because there were two situations where we were not far away from perfect.</p><img id="i-1e95e0f97bdf2706" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="518" width="634" alt="Liverpool registered a clean sheet and Klopp was complimentary of Joe Gomez's performance" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-1e95e0f97bdf2706" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34683822-8865917-image-m-68_1603319587065.jpg" height="518" width="634" alt="Liverpool registered a clean sheet and Klopp was complimentary of Joe Gomez's performance" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Liverpool registered a clean sheet and Klopp was complimentary of Joe Gomez's performance</p><img id="i-8a6c0d53ca081cf9" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="335" width="634" alt="Fabinho was also a standout performer and made a vital goal-line clearance in the first half" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-8a6c0d53ca081cf9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34679166-8865917-image-a-69_1603319631586.jpg" height="335" width="634" alt="Fabinho was also a standout performer and made a vital goal-line clearance in the first half" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Fabinho was also a standout performer and made a vital goal-line clearance in the first half</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But the result is absolutely OK. Now on Saturday night a completely different challenge. Sheffield United have had their legs on the sofa and we need to recover quickly. It was a good performance but there is a lot to improve - and that is good.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All eyes were on Fabinho and Joe Gomez, given the injuries to Van Dijk and Joel Matip, but Klopp did not have any doubts about whether the Brazilian would be able to cope with the different demands that were asked of him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'For the two at the back, it was their first game together,' said Klopp. 'They need to get used to each other, they need to get used to the verbal demands. Fabinho can play the position, he likes playing it actually. If I asked him to play right back I don't think he would enjoy it as much.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In our situation we have to keep those boys fit. I'm not surprised Fabinho plays in the position, otherwise I would have thought about a different solution. That would have been tricky but I'm really pleased.'</p></div>

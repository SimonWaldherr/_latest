Estimating the best time to buy a TV is a science at this point.

NerdWallet has tried to pin down the pattern: Black Friday, of course, sees some of the biggest TV discounts of the year. Other notable sales can be seen when consumers are preparing to watch a big event on TV (Super Bowl season) or when tech brands release their new TV line for the year.

But the 2020 shopping calendar isn't following the regular rules. Brands like Samsung announced the delay of some TV launches due to pandemic-related production issues. Sony and Disney pushed back countless movies slated to come out in theaters sometime in 2020, putting a spotlight on the consumer's reliance on streaming at home.

Fall sports and shows make this the best season to buy a TV, anyway — but a chilly season plagued with closed public spaces and canceled holiday events due to the coronavirus means that at-home entertainment could be a bigger deal this year than ever before. Retailers are likely expecting this heightened demand for TVs, and we don't think they'll wait until Black Friday to start the sales. With Amazon Prime Day's postponement from July to October, there's little reason for retailers to not simply use it as a kickoff for a month-and-a-half long Black Friday event. (We're already seeing bigger discounts now than what we saw over the weekend of Oct. 9.)

Here are our favorite Prime Day 2020 TV deals from Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and Dell, organized by brand, then size, then price:

Samsung

OUR TOP PICK: Samsung 85-inch Q70T Series 4K UHD Smart TV (QN85Q70TAFXZA) — $2,599.99

TVs over 80 inches are expensive as it is. But cutting corners by opting for the cheapest 85-inch TV you can find isn't always the move — especially if detail-oriented entertainment like sports or gaming is part of the daily schedule. This 85-inch beauty uses AI upscaling to scan each scene and make it as crisp as possible, plus adaptive technology that adjusts brightness and blacks based on the bright sunlight (or lack thereof) in the room. Going with this model specifically gets you 20 more inches of screen compared to the 65-inch Q800T 8K model, which is on sale for the same price.

LG

OUR TOP PICK: LG 75-inch 4K UHD LED Smart TV (75UN7070PU) — $799.99

A 75-inch TV on sale for less than $800? We're sold on that alone — but LG didn't skimp on the quality, either. This webOS TV simplifies streaming service organization (and makes searching easy, even if you don't know which platform carries the show or movie you're looking for). Content is displayed on a 4K IPS display, plus an extra oomph from active HDR.

Sony

OUR TOP PICK: Sony 77-inch OLED A9G Series 4K HDR Smart TV (XBR77A9G) — $3,499

Down an extra $1,000 from the already-stellar sale price we saw the first weekend of October, the 77-inch version of Sony's 2019 A9G line has officially hit the 50% off mark. That massive discount doesn't exactly make it the cheapest 77-inch out there, but cinephiles who are wasting away due to their lack of movie theatre trips deserve this type of viewing quality in their living room. This OLED masterpiece is armed with what Sony calls its best processor ever and uses Acoustic Surface Audio+ sound (dual actuators and subwoofers) to bring concert hall-like sound to each scene.

Linda Evangelista has publicly sided with the four models who have accused her ex-husband, former Elite Modelling agency head Gerald Marie, of sexual misconduct and rape.

Praising the “courage and strength” of the women, the supermodel, who was married to Marie between 1987 and 1993, told the Guardian that “based on her own experiences” with Marie, she believed the women.

“During my relationship with Gérald Marie, I knew nothing of these sexual allegations against him, so I was unable to help these women,” Evangelista told the paper.

“Hearing them now, and based on my own experiences, I believe that they are telling the truth. It breaks my heart because these are wounds that may never heal, and I admire their courage and strength for speaking up today.”

France has opened a rape investigation into Marie, for the abuse of up to nine models.

Former model and Mickey Rourke’s ex-wife Carré Otis has claimed Marie repeatedly raped her when she was just 17 and living in the spare room of his apartment in 1986.

Evangelista was dating Marie at the time and was not there when the alleged abuse happened. There is no suggestion from Otis or any of the models that Evangelista was aware of the allegations at the time.

Other models who have filed criminal complaints in France are Jill Dodd and Ebba Karlsson, and former undercover journalist Lisa Brinkworth, according to the Guardian.

Marie’s lawyers told the Guardian, the former model boss denies the accusations and was “extremely affected” by them adding: “He intends to actively participate in the manifestation of the truth within the scope of the opened criminal investigation.”

Marie isn’t the only modeling boss accused of sexual misconduct and rape. The modeling industry was rife with bad behavior for years. Pedo-perv Jeffrey Epstein’s former pal, model agent Jean-Luc Brunel, has been accused of rape as well as trafficking girls for his friend — while Elite founder John Casablancas had a thing for young girls— dating Stephanie Seymour when she was just 15 (he was 41) and marrying Aline Wermelinge when she was 17 and he was 50.

Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Value Fund (NUW)

This closed-end fund trades on a public exchange like a mutual or exchange-traded fund but is distinct in that it has a fixed number of shares that were sold through an initial public offering. Closed-end funds typically sell at a discount or premium to their net asset value. Steven Jon Kaplan, founder of True Contrarian Investments, recommends this value-oriented fund that offers monthly tax-free income. The fund invests at least 80% of its assets in investment-grade bonds and the remaining 20% or so may be of lower credit quality. The fund is currently selling at a -5.11% discount (as of Oct. 6, 2020), which means that an investor would buy the underlying issues for less than their true value. The distribution rate is currently 2.93%. Kaplan recommends waiting until after Thanksgiving to buy as the price could decline due to tax-loss selling.

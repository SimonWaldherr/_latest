Tighter lockdowns are looming for millions of people across England, as Matt Hancock was poised to announce new restrictions for parts of the North West and London.

The Health Secretary will give a statement in the Commons later where he is expected to escalate the coronavirus alert levels for Greater Manchester, Essex and London.

Local leaders in Greater Manchester are fiercely resisting attempts to shift the area to the highest level - 'Tier 3' - where pubs and bars must close and households are banned from mixing indoors.

Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester Mayor, has threatened legal action against the Government if the region was moved from Tier 2 to Tier 3 without a financial bailout.

Health minister Jo Churchill told local MPs on a phone call that "no decision has been taken" on whether to move Greater Manchester into highest Tier 3.

This comes after angry talks between GM leaders and No 10 this morning over financial package.

Mr Hancock was said to be "frustrated" at the chaos.

In London, the alert level is due to be raised from Tier 1 - the lowest level of lockdown - to Tier 2, which means a ban on indoors meet-ups with people outside your household.

London MPs were told by Health Minister Helen Whately that changes would come into effect at 00.01 on Saturday.

Essex will also go into Tier 2 at the same time, after calls from local leaders to move to a tougher lockdown.

Crunch talks were ongoing on Thursday morning, with local MPs in London, Lancashire and Greater Manchester summoned to phone briefings with ministers.

Local MPs in Lancashire were told the region would remain under Tier 2 rules for now, after speculation it might be forced into the strictest lockdown.

Pressed on the move on Sky News, he said: "Well, as I say, I'm not going to speculate.

"Matt Hancock is going to make a statement to parliament as to where we are at but you can clearly see the numbers."

He said ministers were also speaking to London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has been calling for a tougher lockdown in the capital

Mr Khan told London health bosses on Wednesday that a change in restrictions was looming, as he expected the coronavirus rate in the capital to imminently hit an average of 100 cases per 100,000 people.

Here are what the changes mean for you.

What are the rules for Tier 3?

Social contact: You cannot meet anyone outside your household or support bubble indoors. Strict rules also ban any meet-ups in private gardens, beer gardens, hospitality or ticketed venues. You will only be able to see people not in your household or bubble is in a public open space, such as a park, forest, beach - and in groups of no more than six.

Pubs and restaurants: All bars must close unless they serve food. You can only buy alcohol if you are also consuming a "substantial meal" - not a bar snack.

Schools, universities and childcare: These remain open in all circumstances, but universities can do more online learning.

Travel and transport: You should limit any journeys made outside your local area - except for work and school run journeys. This is guidance, rather than the law. People are advised against overnight stays outside the area or having visitors to stay from elsewhere.

Work: The advice is to work from home if you can.

Weddings and funerals: 15 guests can attend marriage ceremonies but receptions are banned. Funerals can have up to 30 mourners, with only 15 people allowed at the wake.

Shops: All retail - including non-essential shops - can stay open.

Gyms, hairdressers, public facilities: Local areas can negotiate whether to close facilities including casinos and gyms, such as they have in the Liverpool City Region.

Sports: Organised indoor sport and exercise classes can continue to take place, provided rule of six is observed

Length of time: Regulations will be reviewed every 28 days and expire after 6 months.

What are the rules for Tier 2?

Social contact: You cannot meet anyone outside your household or support bubble indoors. This applies at home or in a public setting. Rule of six limits apply outdoors.

Pubs and restaurants: Hospitality venues have a 10pm curfew and table service only.

Schools, universities and childcare: Remain open in all circumstances, but universities can do more online learning.

Travel and transport: There are no restrictions on travel but you are advised to minimise the number of journey you make.

Work: The advice is to work from home if you can.

Weddings and funerals: 15 guests can attend marriage ceremonies and receptions. Funerals can have up to 30 mourners, with only 15 people allowed at the wake.

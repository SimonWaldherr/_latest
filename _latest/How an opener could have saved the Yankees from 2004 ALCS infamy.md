<div><p>ARLINGTON, Texas &#8212; Between the constant debates this month over pitching strategies and the American League Championship Series nearly re-enacting the Yankees&#8217; <a href="https://nypost.com/2004/10/21/chokes-on-yanks-greatest-collapse-in-baseball-history-gives-flag-to-bosox/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">historic collapse to the Red Sox</a> 16 years earlier, a thought popped into my head. Sixteen years later, I realized how the Yankees should have gone after the Red Sox in 2004 ALCS Game 7 at Yankee Stadium.</p>
<p>They should have tabbed Felix Heredia as their opener.</p>
<p>Of course, at the time such a thought would have constituted blasphemy. Start the game with a reliever and then switch over to a starter?! Insanity! But it sure as heck would have given the Yankees a better chance of avoiding infamy than their actual plan.</p>
<p>Those Yankees, unlike these 2020 Yankees (who, you might remember, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/07/there-was-no-need-for-yankees-deivi-garcia-shenanigans/">actually used an opener and saw it backfire</a>), were the perfect candidates for an opener. They had only three starters they trusted: Mike Mussina (who pitched in Games 1 and 5), Jon Lieber (Games 2 and 6) and Orlando Hernandez (Game 4). Surly veteran Kevin Brown started Game 3 at Fenway Park and lasted only two innings, allowing four runs, and his fellow first-year Yankee Javier Vazquez relieved him and also gave up four runs, albeit in 4 &#8531; innings. While the Yankees actually won that contest, 19-8, neither man inspired any confidence whatsoever. As Joe Torre detailed in his book with Tom Verducci &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yankee-Years-Joe-Torre/dp/0767930428?tag=nypost-20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Yankee Years</a>,&#8221; is that the Yankees started the game knowing they were cooked. As Mussina said, &#8220;We&#8217;re finished. That was the feeling after Game 6. As soon as Game 6 ended.&#8221; The Yankees started Brown and trailed 2-0 after one inning, with Ortiz slamming a two-run homer, and 6-0 after two, with Damon clubbing&#8217;s Vazquez first pitch of the night for a grand slam.</p>
 
<p>Heredia, then 29, ranked as one of the least consequential players on the Yankees&#8217; postseason roster; he had put up a 6.28 ERA in 47 regular-season appearances. Yet the southpaw knew how to pitch to lefty batters, who slashed a not-awful .216/.326/.405 against him that year. David Ortiz, who would win Most Valuable Player honors for the series, was 1-for-8 lifetime against Heredia with two walks and three strikeouts and failed to reach base safely against him in Games 5 and 6. Johnny Damon was 0-for-3 with a sacrifice bunt and hit by pitch. Trot Nixon was 1-for-9 with two walks and two strikeouts. Shoot, Heredia even struck out the lethal righty hitter Manny Ramirez twice in four tries, a double and a walk coming out of the other two.</p>
<p>If the Yankees started Heredia and told him to get through Nixon at the sixth spot (assuming Terry Francona didn&#8217;t change his starting lineup), maybe Heredia puts up a couple of zeroes and gives the Yankees&#8217; lineup a chance to do something against Boston starter Derek Lowe. And maybe Brown or Vazquez feel better about entering the game with a lead, or perhaps even El Duque, on two days&#8217; rest like Lowe, could have been sold on contributing a few innings of relief work.</p>
<p>For sure, it would have constituted a better plan than throwing Brown out there and hoping for the best. For sure, too, it would&#8217;ve made for a more sensible usage of the opener than what the current Yankees did with Deivi Garcia and J.A. Happ in AL Division Series Game 2 against the Rays. Instead, the &#8216;04 Yankees remain a group of one thanks to the Rays&#8217; rebound after losing Games 4, 5 and 6. And the &#8216;20 Yankees join the Blue Jays and Astros as casualties of these remarkable Rays, who, the Dodgers will see, pounce on any advantage you give them.</p>

<div><p>Banksy's Show me the Monet painting sells for &#163;7.5m at auction</p><p>Banksy&#8217;s reimagining of Claude Monet&#8217;s impressionist water lilies has fetched more than &#163;7.5m at auction, easily surpassing expectations.</p>
<p>Show Me The Monet was created in 2005 and adds abandoned shopping trolleys and a traffic cone to the famous garden scene.</p>
<p>It was sold at a Sotheby&#8217;s event in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london" class="u-underline">London</a> on Wednesday following a near nine-minute battle between five collectors, the auction house said.</p>
<p>It fetched &#163;7,551,600 against an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/18/banksy-show-me-the-monet-tribute-on-sale-sothebys-auction" class="u-underline">expectation of between &#163;3.5m-5m</a>.</p>
<p>The painting is the second most expensive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/banksy" class="u-underline">Banksy</a> sold at auction, after the reclusive artist&#8217;s Devolved Parliament sold for &#163;9.9m last year.</p>

<p>Show Me The Monet forms part of a series titled Crude Oil, which &#8220;remixes&#8221; canonical works.</p>
<p>The series also includes Vincent van Gogh&#8217;s Sunflowers wilting or dead in their vase, Edward Hopper&#8217;s Nighthawks confronted by an angry man in Union Jack boxer shorts and Andy Warhol&#8217;s Marilyn Monroe re-faced with Kate Moss.</p>
<p>Alex Branczik, Sotheby&#8217;s European head of contemporary art, said: &#8220;In one of his most important paintings, Banksy has taken Monet&#8217;s iconic depiction of the Japanese bridge in the Impressionist master&#8217;s famous garden at Giverny and transformed it into a modern-day fly-tipping spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;More canal than idyllic lily pond, Banksy litters Monet&#8217;s composition with discarded shopping trollies and a fluorescent orange traffic cone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever prescient as a voice of protest and social dissent, here Banksy shines a light on society&#8217;s disregard for the environment in favour of the wasteful excesses of consumerism.&#8221;</p>

These institutions, unfortunately, are not alone. Trump's approach has also undercut the United States economically and strategically, ultimately undermining Washington's attempts to fend off an illiberal and what many have called an increasingly assertive China's attempts to seize global leadership</p><p>Since Trump took office, the number of international students enrolled in the United States has dropped precipitously . In recent months, some students abandoned plans to study here because of Trump's Covid-19-related immigration restrictions ; others reconsidered their plans because of our inability to get the virus under control. One Vietnamese student studying in California put it simply: " The United States is no longer a safe place ."</p><p>And while visa overstays are broadly a problem, DHS's new plan to address them is so heavy-handed that it promises to diminish both the number of international students in the United States and America's reputation, which Trump has already damaged greatly</p><a></a><p>Indeed, this potential restriction, along with others that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/07/trumps-cruel-attack-on-international-students.html" target="_blank">floated over the summer</a> , reinforces the notion that the US is hostile to foreigners and that international students would be better off pursuing opportunities in the United Kingdom, Canada, or even China.</p><a></a><a></a><a></a><p>But without international students, universities will lose <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2020/07/28/international-students-budget-crisis-for-colleges.html" target="_blank">millions in revenue</a> , the US economy will <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/sites/default/files/media/document/isev-2019.pdf" target="_blank">lose billions</a> , and the United States will be deprived of the <a href="https://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Insights/Open-Doors" target="_blank">significant contributions</a> that foreign students make in many fields.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Losing international students, or even proposing barriers to keep them out, is also disastrous from a strategic perspective.</p><a></a><p>By welcoming international students -- over <a href="https://www.iie.org/Why-IIE/Announcements/2019/11/Number-of-International-Students-in-the-United-States-Hits-All-Time-High" target="_blank">1 million in 2019</a> -- the United States advances its soft power abroad.

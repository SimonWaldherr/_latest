Aides at the National Governors Association have begun considering replacements to Gov. Andrew Cuomo as its chair, according to a report, as speculation mounts that he will be eyed for attorney general in a potential Biden administration.

Cuomo, a fairly close political ally of Democratic nominee Joe Biden, is being pushed for the role as the nation’s top law enforcement officer, Axios reported Sunday.

Given their relationship, the outlet reports that Biden “would consider him” for the job.

The former vice president and New York governor have long had a professional rapport, though it evolved into one that was more personal in recent years.

In 2015, according to the New York Times, Cuomo earned himself “Biden’s lasting appreciation, and helped cement a personal friendship” when the two discussed the then-VP mulling a run for the presidency in the 2016 cycle.

For months, Biden spoke to Cuomo as he considered whether he would enter the race, at that point being dominated by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Biden appreciated Cuomo’s counsel as he considered his options, according to the paper, and it impacted their political relationship going forward.

At the time, both men were in mourning, Biden of his son Beau and Cuomo of his father, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, both of whom had passed away that year.

In terms of their political alliance, Biden came to Cuomo’s aid when the moderate Democrat faced an energized primary challenge from actor and progressive activist Cynthia Nixon in 2018, campaigning across the state for the incumbent.

Just one year later, Cuomo became an early supporter of the vice president joining the 2020 field.

After joining the presidential race, Cuomo and billionaire hedge fund manager Jim Chanos were some of the first in the state to hold a major fundraiser for Biden, CNBC reported at the time.

As the race began to get crowded — with a staggering 27 Democrats who ran this cycle — the governor spent months maintaining his confidence in his candidate of choice to the public.

“When one of them needs something, it’s automatic. It’s not a calculation,” a person familiar with their relationship told Axios.

“He just sees Joe Biden as a morally decent guy, the same way I know he saw his own father, in that sense,” said Jay Jacobs, New York Democratic Party chair and a close Cuomo ally, told The Times.

Reached for comment on the story, a Cuomo spokesman told Axios that the story was not accurate.

“100 percent he’s made zero outreach, has had zero conversations about this and has made his desire to stay in New York clear as day and be governor as long as people want him,” spokesman Richard Azzopardi said in a statement to the outlet.

The Biden campaign declined to comment on the potential for an Attorney General Cuomo when reached by The Post. A representative for the National Governor’s Association did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

Boris Johnson is unlikely to keep his promise to reach 500,000 coronavirus tests a day within a fortnight unless ministers "massage the figures", the body representing NHS laboratories has warned.

The Prime Minister has pledged to increase testing capacity to half a million tests a day by October 30 amid deepening concern over the country's failing Test and Trace system.

However, Allan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, which represents NHS laboratories processing tests across the UK, said he saw "no signs" that the target could be met.

"I don't think the Government will hit that 500,000 target in two weeks unless it massages the figures somehow," he tole The Telegraph.

"It might try to say it has got the capacity, but that's meaningless unless you can actually process the tests on that day. You might have the machines, but you still need the staff to operate them. It's like saying you've got a car but no driver."

Daily capacity is currently 345,135 tests with 295,690 processed, according to data released on Thursday. To hit half a million tests by October 30, capacity would have to shoot up by 45 per cent in the next fortnight.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding its third day of hearings to consider the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court.

Listen to NPR's live special coverage of the hearings on this page beginning at 9 a.m. ET. each day. Follow updates here.

The seat was made vacant last month by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, launching a contentious nomination process just weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election.

The process has been complicated by several Senate Republicans testing positive for the coronavirus, including Senate Judiciary members Sens. Mike Lee and Thom Tillis.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the committee will take additional safety precautions for the hearings, and senators will be allowed to ask questions remotely or in person.

If confirmed by Election Day, Judge Barrett's confirmation process would be one of the shortest of the past several decades.

Kim Kardashian sits down with David Letterman on the first episode of the new season of Netflix's&#160;&#8220;My Next Guest Needs No Introduction."

<p>Still, Letterman would&#8217;t let her off the hook, encouraging Kardashian to take a macro-level look at how her involvement benefits Trump in the long run.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Your good work is overwhelming,&#8221; Letterman added. &#8220;It&#8217;s a positive force that diminishes what I consider to be unacceptable behavior by the president.&#8221;</p><p>But Kardashian refused to give up any ground, reiterating that she remains &#8220;extremely focused&#8221; on her mission and is still &#8220;truly grateful&#8221; for the Trump administration&#8217;s criminal justice reform efforts.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give props where props are due,&#8221; she said.&#160;</p><p>In 2018, Kardashian <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-grants-alice-marie-johnson-clemency-kim-kardashian_n_5b16d73ae4b09578259c521e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">successfully appealed to the president</a> to secure the commutation of 63-year-old Alice Marie Johnson, who served 21 years for a nonviolent drug offense. A year later, she <a href="https://apnews.com/article/105e865eb42344688ee83cf50b2133f6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke at the White House</a>, praising the passing of the a&#160;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kushner-criminal-justice-bill_n_5af0a4bee4b0c4f1932576c2">bipartisan prison reform bill</a>, which reduces prison sentences for some federal inmates,&#160;while announcing a partnership with Lyft that will help people find jobs after being released from prison.</p><p>In March, she also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51744918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accompanied Johnson and two other newly freed women</a>, Tynice Nichole Hall and Crystal Munoz,&#160;whose prison sentences were also recently commuted, to the White House to draw attention to criminal justice reform.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">White House here we come!!! <a href="https://t.co/exif6oZ6sl">pic.twitter.com/exif6oZ6sl</a></p>&#8212; Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) <a href="https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1235229349474979842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2020</a></blockquote>
 
<p>The SKIMS founder has since <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-lawyer-bar_n_5cae1c33e4b03ab9f24f5af6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started studying to become a lawyer</a> to bolster her advocacy efforts, taking part in a four-year apprenticeship program with hopes of practicing as early as 2022.&#160;</p><p>While the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan hasn&#8217;t explicitly endorsed a candidate for the upcoming presidential election, Kourtney Kardashian has seemingly backed brother-in-law&#8217;s Kanye West&#8217;s bid for the White House.&#160;</p><p>Last week, Kourtney <a href="https://people.com/politics/kourtney-kardashian-criticized-promoting-kanye-west-campaign-merchandise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sparked a wave of online backlash</a> after she shared a photo of herself sporting a &#8220;Vote Kanye&#8221; hat with a link for her millions of followers to do the same.&#160;</p><p>West <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kanye-west-president-2020-tweet-trump_n_5f013bfbc5b612083c5d670f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> he was running for president on July 4. Despite missing the deadlines to get his name on the ballot in multiples states, he&#8217;s since called on his fans to write in his name instead.&#160;</p><p id="inline-newsletter_placeholder"></p>

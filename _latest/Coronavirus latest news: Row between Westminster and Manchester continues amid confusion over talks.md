The growing dispute over coronavirus restrictions between Greater Manchester and Downing Street shows no sign of conclusion, with confusion cast over whether or not the parties will meet this weekend to attempt to find a solution.

Earlier this week Andy Burnham, Manchester's Mayor, delivered a potentially fatal blow to the Government's coronavirus strategy, standing outside the Central Library under a banner boldly declaring 'We are open'.

“They are willing to sacrifice jobs and businesses here to try and save them elsewhere,” he said. “Greater Manchester, the Liverpool city region and Lancashire are being set up as the canaries in the coal mine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy”.

The two parties haven't spoken since Thursday, but earlier today No 10 suggested talks have been scheduled for Sunday morning, as both sides come under pressure to come to an agreement over Tier 3 coronavirus restrictions.

But the office for Burnham, who is resisting the highest level of controls without more financial support for workers and businesses, flatly denied a call had been scheduled.

"Nothing has yet been arranged," a spokesman said.

The dispute comes as new controls, including in Lancashire and London, mean 28 million people in England are living under heightened restrictions.

But experts are concerned such measures do not go far enough, and there are growing calls for a national two-week "circuit breaker" lockdown.

The fate of “The Bachelorette” season premiere is in LeBron James’ hands.

Lakers fans and Bachelor Nation are hoping James can finish off the Heat and Jimmy Butler in Game 6 on Sunday night, as a potential Game 7 would take place Tuesday on ABC and push the airing of “Bachelorette” Clare Crawley’s big night back a week.

“I may watch my first seconds of this years NBA Finals tonight just to make sure the Lakers win so the Bachelorette can comeback on Tuesday,” one fan tweeted Sunday.

“If the nba finals goes to seven games then it will interrupt the season premiere of the bachelorette…. lebron we have never needed you more,” another posted.

“i stg (swear to god) if the nba finals ruin the bachelorette premiere…..” one griped.

“The Bachelorette” would premiere on Tuesday, Oct. 20, according to Parade.com, if there is a Game 7 of the NBA Finals.

Crawley, 39, was named the “Bachelorette” of Season 16 in March. Her season had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was filmed over the summer.

Game 6 of the NBA Finals tips off at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday.

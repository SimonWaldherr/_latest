<p>When Beckom again asks the woman to keep her mask on the next time she comes to the store, the woman becomes agitated, saying wearing a mask is &#8220;not the law&#8221; and that COVID-19 is &#8220;a hoax.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;This is America and I don&#8217;t have to do what you say,&#8221; the woman yells as she&#8217;s leaving. &#8220;Trump 2020.&#8221;</p><p>The barista tells her to have a nice day.</p><p>After exiting, the customer stops, turns around and comes back into the Starbucks.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Jory Mendes, a Starbucks spokesman, commended Beckom for keeping cool during a &#8220;difficult&#8221; moment.</p><p>&#8220;We expect our partners and customers alike to foster a welcoming environment, and this behavior is certainly not welcome in our stores,&#8221; Mendes said when reached by phone late Monday. &#8220;Our focus right now is providing support to our partner who demonstrated tremendous composure during a very difficult interaction.&#8221;</p><p>Beckom did not return a request for comment, but <a class="link" href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/santee-barista-brushes-off-racist-anti-mask-tirade-from-customer-who-to-cover-up/2427377/" target="_blank">told NBC-TV Channel 7</a> these incidents happen daily at her Starbucks store.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Black in America, so I&#8217;ve dealt with these kinds of situations before,&#8221; Beckom told the news station. &#8220;I&#8217;m able to stay calm and collected in these kinds of situations because I don&#8217;t want to risk my job.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

  Ezekiel Elliott Takes Blame for Cowboys' Loss to Cardinals After 2 Fumbles 
description: > 
  Michael Ainsworth/Associated PressDallas Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliott held himself accountable after his two lost fumbles in the first half proved pivotal in his team's 38-10 defeat to the Arizona Cardinals on Monday night.The Cardinals punted on their first three possessions before Elliott's fumble set them up on their own 46-yard line.Two plays later, Elliott coughed it up again, allowing the Cardinals to set up on the Dallas 27-yard line.The Cowboys have many things to worry about amid their 2-4 start, and Elliott's fumble problems are on that list.With Prescott out, the Cowboys need to have confidence in the running back whose $15 million average salary is tied for second-highest at the position.

Britain's insurance broking hub is considering abandoning the traditional office set-up and allowing staff to permanently work from home some of the time.

Lloyd's of London chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said that coronavirus had sped up the process of it becoming 'a truly flexible workplace'.

Founded in 1686, it is the world's biggest and oldest insurance market and a pillar of the City of London.

'Flexible': Founded in 1686, Lloyd's is the world's biggest and oldest insurance market and a pillar of the City of London

It is housed in a modern-style Grade 1- listed building near the Gherkin, but began operating remotely in lockdown.

Switching to a more flexible model would follow moves at many of the City's big financial firms.

CarnegieBrown said: 'In the longer term, we are likely to see a blended approach that enables the best of remote working with the benefits of a flexible work space.'

Lloyd's came under fire last year for having a culture of widespread sexual harassment, which it has since vowed to stamp out.

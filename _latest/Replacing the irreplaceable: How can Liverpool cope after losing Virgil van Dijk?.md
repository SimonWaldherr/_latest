  Replacing the irreplaceable: How can Liverpool cope after losing Virgil van Dijk? 
description: > 
  For owners Fenway Sports Group, the agenda for any crisis summit with Sporting Director Michael Edwards, club president Mike Gordon and manager Jurgen Klopp need only be short and to the point.“How do we replace the irreplaceable in the face of Virgil van Dijk’s injury?”The short answer is they can’t.That does not mean the club can simply instruct Klopp to accept Van Dijk’s injury as an act of God and get by with what he has.The dynamic reaction of Klopp and his players is a given.But — as has been the case for five years — the response needs to be a group effort from the top down.

<div><p>Whatever they call the football equivalent of a Cobra meeting, it is a fair assumption there has been one required among Liverpool's executive management team over the last 72 hours.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/05/13/inside-story-fenway-transformed-liverpool-chaos-2010-record/">owners Fenway Sports Group</a>, the agenda for any crisis summit with Sporting Director Michael Edwards, club president Mike Gordon and manager Jurgen Klopp need only be short and to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we replace the irreplaceable in the face of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/18/virgil-van-dijk-injures-cruciate-ligament-faces-race-return/">Virgil van Dijk&#8217;s injury</a>?&#8221;</p>
<p>The short answer is they can&#8217;t. The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/01/19/virgilvan-dijk-possesses-every-quality-best-centre-back-last/">perfect centre-half</a> has been reduced to a watching brief for the foreseeable future, so it is futile to consider who can fill the void.</p>
<p>That does not mean the club can simply instruct Klopp to accept Van Dijk&#8217;s injury as an act of God and get by with what he has. Klopp has many talents as a coach, but working a miracle for eight months with only two senior centre-halves is a stretch which may be beyond even his considerable coaching talent and powers of positive thinking.&#160;</p>
<p>Klopp is adept at re-energising players and fans in the face of adversity &#8212;&#160;and he is sure to do so again ahead of Wednesday's Champions League opener at Ajax &#8212;&#160;but he has never spun facts. The dynamic reaction of Klopp and his players is a given. But &#8212;&#160;as has been the case for five years &#8212; the response needs to be a group effort from the top down.</p>
<p>The club&#8217;s owners could argue the merits of getting through most, possibly all, of their remaining 33 Premier League games with Joel Matip and Joe Gomez, utilising Fabinho as their deputy or even occasionally promoting some of their academy youngsters.</p>

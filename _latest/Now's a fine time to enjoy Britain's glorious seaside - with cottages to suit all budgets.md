This may have been a year of rules, more rules and a whole lot of undesirable travel restrictions — but that does not mean you can’t have an enjoyable autumn break.

The ‘rule of six’, although limiting big multi-generational gatherings, makes smaller family get-togethers quite possible at one of many hundreds of rental cottages at the British seaside.

No need to worry about pesky Covid-19 tests before flights; no quarantining on your return home. And it’s wonderful by the sea in the autumn: bracing walks along beaches and above cliffs, thundering waves during storms, wheeling gulls and the promise of a cosy hostelry with a fireplace and a warm welcome.

Embrace the chill: Now’s a fine time to enjoy Britain’s glorious seaside - with cottages to suit all budgets

Charming: Little Thatch, which sleep four, is a short stroll from the wide sandy beach and pier at Walton-on-the-Naze in Essex

Little Thatch, a black panelled cottage, has buckets of old-fashioned charm with low rafters, a brick log fire and a bedroom in the eaves. There’s a small compromise with one bedroom and a sofa bed but the gains come in the positioning; a short stroll from the wide sandy beach and pier at Walton-on-the-Naze.

BIG ATTRACTION: Hire a bike from nearby Frinton-on-Sea and loop the six-mile coastal section to Clacton-on-Sea (Johnsons Cycles, 01255 851852).

HIDDEN KENT

Deal is one of Kent's best lesser-known resorts with its expanse of pebble beach. Stay at The Pilot's House tucked down a quiet street

Deal doesn’t get quite as much of the spotlight as its coastal neighbours, but the great cafes, warren of narrow streets and expanse of pebble beach make it one of Kent’s best lesser-known resorts.

At its heart, the pink facade of The Pilot’s House, a rustic cottage tucked down a quiet street, gives an inkling of what to expect inside: a mix of eclectic and homely design such as Belfast sinks, brass taps and a comfy green velvet sofa.

BIG ATTRACTION: History buffs can lose a whole day roaming the coastal fort of Deal Castle (from £7.90; english-heritage.org.uk).

HOW TO DO IT: Sleeps four from £615pw; keeperscottages.co.uk.

This dreamy 18th-century cottage right on the bank of the River Yealm at Noss Mayo has access to the water below and kayaks for those brave enough to launch them straight on to the water.

The fresh, nautical decor of Early Tide chimes with the surrounding coast and beaches, and neighbouring Newton Ferrers is just across the creek.

BIG ATTRACTION: The Swan Inn enjoys a riverside location. Grab a takeaway coffee before a walk and a well-deserved pint after (swaninnnossmayo.com).

HOW TO DO IT: Sleeps four, from £568pw; classic.co.uk.

SEDUCTIVE SCOTLAND

Rose Bay Cottage is a three-mile walk to the glassy waters and white sands of quiet Camas Daraich beach

If you're looking for a hide-away, this cracker overlooking the Sleat peninsula on the Isle of Skye is a breath of fresh air.

The house has two bedrooms, cosy furnishings and a banquet-style dining area.

BIG ATTRACTION: It’s a three-mile walk to the glassy waters and white sands of quiet Camas Daraich beach.

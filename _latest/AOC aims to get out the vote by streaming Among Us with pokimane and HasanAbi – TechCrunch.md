<div><p>AOC aims to get out the vote by streaming Among Us with pokimane and HasanAbi</p><p id="speakable-summary">We are about seven months into a pandemic and just two weeks from a presidential election. At this point, surprises are a dime a dozen. So it should feel very 2020 that <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aoc">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is about to stream Among Us</a>, the hit game of 2020, on Twitch alongside mega-streamer pokimane and political analyst HasanAbi.</p>
<p>Ocasio-Cortez tweeted yesterday that she was looking for people to play the popular game with in an effort to get out the vote, noting that she&#8217;s never played before but that it looks fun.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone want to play Among Us with me on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitch" target="_blank">Twitch </a> to get out the vote? (I&#8217;ve never played but it looks like a lot of fun)</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>&#8212; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/alexandria-ocasio-cortez" target="_blank">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez </a> (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1318276809977434112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>Streamer pokimane, who has 6 million followers on Twitch and whose YouTube videos regularly see more than 1 million views each, responded to the tweet with a figurative raised hand.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let&#8217;s do it! I&#8217;ll set up and account and get some streaming equipment today</p>

<p></p><p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hasanabi">HasanAbi</a>, a very popular political commentator on Twitch, who has more than 380,000 Twitter followers, also chimed in to the conversation saying that they&#8217;re already making a lobby. It wasn&#8217;t long before Rep. Ilhan Omar raised her hand, too.</p>

<p></p><p>A good game of Among Us (imagine that someone mixed a fairly basic multiplayer video game with a murder mystery party) usually requires 10 players, so the other six players are still TBD. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523878/aoc-twitch-stream-among-us-pokimane">the Verge reports</a> that a handful of other streamers (such as DrLupo, Felicia Day, Greg Miller, James Charles, and Neekolul) also lined up to play with AOC.</p>
<p>According to Ocasio-Cortez, the stream is all about getting out the vote. And this isn&#8217;t the first time that she&#8217;s used video games to connect with her followers. AOC opened up her DMs to all 6.8 million of her followers back in May to let them send her an invite to their island, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/05/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-now-playing-animal-crossing-shes-visiting-her-followers/">she visited them</a>.</p>
<p>Millennial voters (and Gen Z) skew toward backing the Biden / Harris ticket, and AOC is coming to them by getting on Twitch and streaming one of the rocket ship games of this year.</p>
<p>The stream starts at 9pm ET/6pm PT and can be found <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/AOC">here</a>.</p>
<p>And you can <a href="https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/">check if you&#8217;re registered to vote here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 9:01pm ET:</strong> AOC hasn&#8217;t even started playing the game yet and has nearly 250,000 concurrent viewers.&#160;</p>

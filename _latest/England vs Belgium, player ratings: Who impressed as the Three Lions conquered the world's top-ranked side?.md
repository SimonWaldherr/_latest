England (3-4-3)

Jordan Pickford 6

Beaten by Lukaku’s penalty but saved well from a firm De Bruyne shot. After a nervy few weeks, this was a more steady performance.

Kyle Walker 8

Recovery speed was crucial in shutting down Belgian attacks, and he was alert to danger within the penalty box. Drove forward on occasion.

Eric Dier 6

Has had his troubles on and off the pitch but this was a more understated showing. Helped England to deal with Lukaku after the break.

Harry Maguire 5

Rattled and bullied by Lukaku in the first half, diving in needlessly to concede the early penalty. Improved considerably after the break.

Trent Alexander-Arnold 5

Unable to bomb forward as he does so often for Liverpool, especially with Castagne and Carrasco pushing aggressively in the other direction.

Jordan Henderson 6

Won the (arguably) dubious penalty that allowed Rashford to equalise. Struggled early on but provided energy and drive after half-time.

Declan Rice 7

  US designates six more Chinese media companies as foreign missions 
description: > 
  (CNN Business) The United States government has labeled six more Chinese media companies operating in the US as foreign missions in the latest round of tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington over restrictions on journalists.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision at a press briefing on Wednesday, saying that the six media companies were "substantially or effectively controlled by a foreign government.""We're not placing any restrictions on what these outlets can publish in the United States," Pompeo said."We simply want to ensure that American people, consumers of information, can differentiate between news written by a free press and propaganda distributed by the Chinese Communist Party itself.For example, any named companies will now need US government approval to buy or lease office space and will have to register personnel changes, including new hires and staff departures, with the State Department.

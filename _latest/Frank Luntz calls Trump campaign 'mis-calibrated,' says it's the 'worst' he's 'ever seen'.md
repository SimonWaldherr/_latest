description: > 
  A well-known Republican pollster on Tuesday characterized President Trump’s campaign as "mis-calibrated" and the "worst" he’s ever seen, during a briefing with British strategic advising company Global Counsel.“I’ve never seen a campaign more mis-calibrated than the Trump campaign.Frankly, his staff ought to be brought up on charges of political malpractice,” Frank Luntz said, The Hill reported.“Hunter Biden does not help put food on the table.“If Donald Trump doesn’t score a knockout then there’s not enough campaigning or mindshare to give him a chance to catch Joe Biden,” Luntz said.

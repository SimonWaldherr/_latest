  Justin Gaethje and the 10 Hardest Punchers in the UFC Today 
description: > 
  0 of 10John Raoux/Associated PressIn the main event of Saturday's anticipated UFC 254 card, one of the hardest punchers in MMA will return to the cage: Justin Gaethje.We'll see Gaethje in action in the card's main event, when he'll look to do something 28 other men have failed to do and defeat Khabib Nurmagomedov.Gaethje will most likely look to accomplish this feat by stopping Nurmagomedov's takedowns and landing a knockout punch.Note: We're ranking the hardest punchers among active UFC fighters.That means that former UFC fighters like Mark Hunt, Cris Cyborg and John Lineker aren't eligible.

He'll win the undisputed lightweight title if he succeeds, but at this point, being the first man to beat Nurmagomedov feels like a more valuable accomplishment than any title win when it comes to cementing one's legacy.</p><p class="">Gaethje will most likely look to accomplish this feat by stopping Nurmagomedov's takedowns and landing a knockout punch. It will be far easier said than done, but if anyone can do it, it's him.</p><p class="">The American falls into a special category of fighters who are capable of shutting off any opponent's power at any moment of any fight. There are a lot of fighters out there with power in their hands, but there are only a few of Gaethje's ilk in the UFC at any given moment.</p><p class="">Who are those fighters today? Allow us to introduce them.</p><p class="">Note: We're ranking the hardest punchers among active UFC fighters. That means that former UFC fighters like Mark Hunt, Cris Cyborg and John Lineker aren't eligible. It also means that fighters like Anthony Johnson, who is ostensibly making a return but has not yet done so, is not eligible, either. Last, we did our best to take weight out of the equation. This is a pound-for-pound list&#8212;otherwise, we'd only be looking at heavyweights. </p></ol>

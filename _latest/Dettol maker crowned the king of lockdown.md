<div><p>Forecasts have been torn up and the company expects to hit targets a year earlier than anticipated. Previous estimates of a &#8220;high single digit&#8221; increase in turnover this year have now been raised to the &#8220;low double digits&#8221;, lifting the shares another 2.5pc in morning trading and taking this year&#8217;s gain to 20pc.</p>
<p>The big question is whether the boom will last once the pandemic abates, or whether this is a short lived boost from a black swan event. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/28/dettol-maker-reckitt-cleans-rush-disinfectant-products/">Reckitt is convinced it&#8217;s the former</a>. &#8220;We expect higher levels of demand to persist as habits become engrained.&#8221; New boss Laxman Narasimhan is off to a clean start.</p>
<h4>Day of reckoning for retailer</h4>
<p>Knitwear tycoon Philip Day divides opinion. His supporters paint him as a saviour of broken businesses, someone who keeps businesses going when everyone else has run for the hills.</p>
<p>Day&#8217;s critics argue that he is a ruthless opportunist, who has crafted a vast and highly profitable retail empire out of the misfortunes of others, including landlords and creditors.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur is discovering that what goes around comes around, as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/17/edinburgh-woollen-mill-brink-21000-jobs-risk/">he battles to save Edinburgh Woollen Mill</a> and the other forgotten high street brands he has quietly assembled from the scrapheap.</p>
<p>It will be a challenge even for someone as adept at operating in the insolvency market as Day. With most of the 1,100 stores in the group closed, it is virtually impossible for him to argue it has a future and is worth saving, leaving the multi-millionaire somewhat resigned to his fate.</p>
<p>Credit insurers have got cold feet and despite having no debt, lenders are reluctant to step in and help when there is little light at the end of the tunnel. It is worth remembering that 21,000 jobs are at stake, which would make it the biggest high street collapse since Woolworths 12 years ago.</p>
<p>Yet, in co-ordinating rescue attempts from the comfort of his Swiss chalet, Day has displayed a disappointing lack of solidarity with the workforce, particularly for a self-made man proud of his council estate upbringing.</p>
<p>With a little more foresight he could have flown to the UK and self-isolated, in time to oversee this week&#8217;s crunch negotiations on the ground. Real crises demand real leadership.</p>
<h4>Coming home to roost</h4>
<p>Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Gertjan Vlieghe has warned there is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/20/negative-rates-may-needed-boost-recovery-says-bank-official/">&#8220;huge uncertainty&#8221;</a> over the scale of looming job losses. Is that what fellow MPC member and Bank chief economist Andy Haldane meant by &#8220;Chicken Licken&#8221; pessimism?</p>

A retired astrophysics professor who now suffers from advanced Parkinsons and amnesia murdered his wife with two blasts from a shotgun in their Washington State home — but remembered to call cops afterward, according to reports.

Thomas Jarboe, 75, called 911 before dawn on Thursday and told dispatchers, “I shot her,” Bellevue Police told Seattle’s KOMO News.

Cops and medics rushed to the home, and found Jarboe waiting for them on the front porch.

“The man came out of the house willingly and turned himself in to the officers,” police spokesperson Meeghan Black told the outlet.

“When they went inside, they found his wife deceased inside.”

Jarboe told cops that victim Kay Saw, 63, was his wife and “abusive” caretaker, KOMO News reported Friday.

“It was on purpose but in self-defense,” he allegedly told the 911 operator of shooting Saw with a 12-gauge.

“She has been abusing me. She is my caretaker. And is completely destroying me,” he allegedly said.

“She hates all my kids, my kids all hate her.”

A neighbor told the station that he often heard hollering from the couple’s home.

“Often times yelling about medications. Not taking medications,” said the neighbor, Mike Hopkins.

Then early Thursday, “We heard the two gun shots.”

Jarboe, an emeritus professor from the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at the University of Washington, is being held in lieu of $2.5 million bail.

I don&#8217;t want no parts of it, it don&#8217;t want no parts of me. It&#8217;s a mutual respect.&#8221; But whether he was or wasn&#8217;t is largely irrelevant.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Odell Beckham Jr. didn't find trouble once on Wednesday but twice with his comment about COVID-19 and being banned from LSU for two years."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The NFL has worked mightily to convey COVID-19&#8217;s risk to teams, coaches and players, first creating detailed protocols and then threatening fines and forfeits for non-compliance. While it&#8217;s true younger and fitter people are less likely to die or get gravely ill from the highly contagious COVID-19, it still poses a danger.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Eduardo Rodriguez, who was to have been the Boston Red Sox&#8217;s starting pitcher on opening day, only got clearance to start walking on a treadmill Sept. 25 after testing positive for COVID-19 on July 7. &#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After COVID outbreaks among the Tennessee Titans and New England Patriots, the protocols were tightened even further and the message repeated that the disease was a threat to not just league personnel, but to the season itself.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">So to hear Beckham, after all this, still sound so willfully clueless was astonishing.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">MORE OBJ:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/browns/2020/10/21/odell-beckham-jr-pissed-cleveland-browns/3716087001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Beckham 'pissed' about being pulled from Browns' blowout loss to Steelers</a></p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">OPINION:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/dolphins/2020/10/21/ryan-fitzpatrick-benched-miami-dolphins-quarterback-tua-tagovailoa/6005315002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Before Tua parade starts, Dolphins' Ryan Fitzpatrick deserves to be celebrated</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And if he was joking? That&#8217;s little better. There is still a good portion of this country that either thinks the virus is a hoax or sees it as no big deal, and there are those gullible enough to drink bleach after President Donald Trump suggested it might be a fine remedy. They don&#8217;t need Beckham and his faux invincibility to give them any more encouragement.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">As for the sanctions from LSU, yes, the NCAA&#8217;s rules on college athletes getting paid are archaic and unreasonable, and need to be overhauled. But they are still, for now, the rules. Beckham knows that. It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that he himself was subject to them.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Yet he went ahead and spread around a wad of $100 bills after LSU beat Clemson in January, and did so in full view of cameras. Maybe he was trying to make a scene, maybe he was trying to make a splash. But his foolish stunt caused real trouble for LSU.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The only way Beckham could have made things worse Wednesday was to tweet out some conspiracy theories. At least his antics are more original than that.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Follow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nrarmour" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">@nrarmour</a>.&#160;</strong></p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/nfl/2020/10/20/nfl-power-rankings-after-week-6-2020-season/5988108002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

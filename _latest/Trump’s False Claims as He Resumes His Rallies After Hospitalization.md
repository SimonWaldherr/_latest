President Trump made a litany of false or misleading claims — many of them familiar — about his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the coronavirus pandemic on Monday in a campaign rally in Florida. Here’s a review of the facts.

What Mr. Trump Said

“Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes. You know? Wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again? He said, ‘Oh, no, we are not going to give a tax increase, but we are going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts.’ Well, that’s $2,000, plus child tax credits, plus all of the other things.”

False. The 2017 tax-cut law lowered the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. Mr. Biden is proposing reverting that top rate to 39.6 percent, but no other income bracket would be affected. Under Mr. Biden’s plan, no one making under $400,000 would see a direct increase in their taxes, though they might feel the indirect effects of the higher corporate taxes that Mr. Biden is also proposing. Mr. Biden would also expand the child tax credit, not eliminate it.

What Mr. Trump Said

“Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro and I said: ‘No, thank you. We’re not doing that.’ That’s why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban-Americans.”

The president&#8217;s mixed messages on the coronavirus &#8211; such as promoting untested therapies and calling into question the efficacy of wearing masks &#8211; has helped sow confusion and discord among Americans as they respond to the virus.</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads2 incontentTeads2--story ad-slot"></p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: President Donald Trump addresses supoorters during a Make America Great Again rally as he campaigns in Erie, PA., Oct. 20, 2020." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>The president has long faced scrutiny for misleading Americans about the pandemic. Perhaps most notably, during an interview with journalist Bob Woodward in March, Trump admitted to deliberately minimizing the seriousness of the disease publicly despite understanding its true danger.</p><p>After testing positive for the virus earlier this month, Trump told Americans, &#8220;don&#8217;t be afraid of Covid,&#8221; prompting scrutiny from critics who accused him of minimizing a disease that had already taken more than 200,000 American lives.</p><p>Critics say it is part of a pattern that harkens back to previous instances in which Trump has echoed messages aligned with misinformation from foreign adversaries.</p><p>&#8220;For years a key part of the Russian disinformation playbook has relied on American elected officials and mainstream media personalities amplifying their narratives,&#8221; said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and the former undersecretary for intelligence at DHS under President Barack Obama.</p><p>&#8220;So from a national security perspective,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;it is highly disconcerting to see a growing number of instances in which these conspiracies promoted by Russia have been mimicked by the president and his supporters.&#8221;</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: The towers of the State Historical Museum, the Kremlin and the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour stand in central Moscow.

It has never been clear whether the president has taken his cues from the foreign adversaries or vice versa.</p><p>Last month, for example, ABC News reported that Russia sought to &#8220;amplify&#8221; concerns about the integrity of U.S. elections by promoting allegations that mail-in voting will lead to widespread fraud &#8211; an unfounded complaint Trump has raised frequently in recent months.</p><p>In the final weeks of the campaign, Trump has also tried to return focus to the business dealings of Vice President Joe Biden&#8217;s son, Hunter, in large part by supporting the efforts of his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to dig up dirt on the Democratic contender&#8217;s family.</p><p>In September, the U.S. Treasury Department characterized one of Giuliani&#8217;s sources of information about the Bidens, Ukrainian politician Andrii Derkach, as a Russian agent.

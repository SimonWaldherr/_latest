Britons could see their travel options further reduced this week as infection rates continue to rise in Sweden and Germany, which are two of just four restriction-free destinations left on the holiday map.

Sweden’s seven-day rate has reached 44.7 per 100,000 people (up from 38.9 a week ago) and Germany’s is at 47.1 (compared to 28.5 on October 11), as a second wave of the virus sweeps across Europe. Germany requires arrivals from "high-risk" areas of the UK to take a Covid-19 test.

The UK Government has previously considered triggering quarantine rules when a country’s caseload tops 20 per 100,000 residents, with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announcing the latest changes each Thursday at 5pm.

Greece (except Mykonos) and Gibraltar are the other two restriction-free options on the UK's travel green list – Greece’s rate has not risen as sharply as Germany's (it’s at 26.6 per 100,000, compared to 23 seven days ago), while the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar appears, so far, to have been spared in quarantine decisions.

On Wednesday, Mr Shapps unveiled two potential testing plans to cut quarantine times for UK travellers.

They included a domestic test a week after arrival in the country and what he described as “an internationally recognised system, in which Britain would be a trailblazer, where tests and isolation take place prior to travel and after travel and would require no quarantine.” However, no start date has been given for either plan.

Meanwhile, a “digital health passport” is due to be tested on flights from the UK to US this week.

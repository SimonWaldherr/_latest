description: > 
  The Mayor of London has called for the 10pm curfew in the city to be scrapped to help restaurants deal with Tier 2 coronavirus restrictions.Sadiq Khan said allowing businesses to stay open past 10pm will boost cashflow by allowing restaurants to increase their bookings throughout the evening.In a statement, Mr Khan said: "I have said for a while that the current curfew rule needs to be rapidly reviewed."Now London and other parts of the country have moved into Tier 2 and higher restrictions, which prohibit household mixing, the current 10pm curfew policy makes even less sense and should be scrapped."Immediately scrapping the 10pm curfew would allow more sittings of single households in restaurants throughout the evening, helping with cashflow at a time when venues need all the support they can get."

<p>The Mayor of London has called for the 10pm curfew in the city to be scrapped to help restaurants deal with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/tier-2-lockdown-rules-high-alert-areas-restrictions/">Tier 2 coronavirus restrictions.</a></p>
<p>Sadiq Khan said allowing businesses to stay open past 10pm will boost cashflow by allowing restaurants to increase their bookings throughout the evening.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/20/uk-lockdown-three-3-tier-rules-restrictions/">Under the Tier 2 restrictions, introduced in London on Saturday</a>, household mixing is banned indoors, meaning pubs and restaurants can only serve single-household customers, providing they abide by the rule of six.</p>
<p>The 10pm curfew has previously been criticised across party lines for its financial impact on businesses as well as causing crowds to build in streets and on public transport when customers leave premises.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr Khan said: "I have said for a while that the current curfew rule needs to be rapidly reviewed.</p>
<p>"We saw the worrying consequences of increased social mixing on the streets and on public transport in the capital around 10pm immediately after its introduction.</p>
<p>"Now London and other parts of the country have moved into Tier 2 and higher restrictions, which prohibit household mixing, the current 10pm curfew policy makes even less sense and should be scrapped.</p>
<p>"Immediately scrapping the 10pm curfew would allow more sittings of single households in restaurants throughout the evening, helping with cashflow at a time when venues need all the support they can get."</p>

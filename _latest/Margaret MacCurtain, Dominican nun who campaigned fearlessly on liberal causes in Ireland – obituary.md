In 1979 she was given three years’ leave of absence to become the first principal of a vocational college in a working-class district of Dublin. On her return she sought an injunction in the High Court, successfully, to fight off UCD authorities who wished to make her part-time on the ground that her commitments – serving a term as prioress of the Sion Hill convent – were incompatible with a full-time post. She also had to brave opposition before having women’s history added to the syllabus in 1987.

Margaret MacCurtain was equally defiant towards the controlling Archbishop McQuaid of Dublin, who demanded to see the text of lectures on the Reformation and Counter-Reformation which she was giving to undergraduates.

Although not incapable of sharpness, she was well liked by students. “Go for it” was her usual enthusiastic response when they sought her advice on a project. She had an engaging smile that betokened openness, and was a sympathetic listener to those who came to her with their troubles.

Her campaigning tendencies manifested themselves when she joined marches to protest against apartheid and, nearer home, the destruction of the remains of Viking Dublin to make way for municipal offices.

She resumed her birth name of Margaret when canon law was amended in the 1970s to allow it but many continued to think of her as the battling “Sister Ben”.

Her main focus had become the feminist movement for “gender equality”. She objected to school textbooks depicting boys doing brave things and girls being passive at home; demanded the amendment of the sexist language of the Bible and in Church liturgy; and debunked the cult of the Virgin Mary that was so strong among Irish Catholics.

She insisted that nuns should be “more than cooing doves” serving the male leadership of the Church, with which she broke ranks boldly when in 1995 she became a patron of the successful “right to remarry” campaign to introduce divorce.

Appointed in 1997 to chair the Advisory Council of the National Archives of Ireland, she was frustrated by its lack of real powers and legislation that did not make it mandatory for government departments to make records available.

Her contribution to scholarship took the form mainly of essays, mostly on aspects of women’s history. A collection of these was published in two volumes in 2008 and 2019.

In her eighties she rescued for publication the doctoral thesis that was her most extensive work of original scholarship. It told the story of how the Dominican Daniel O’Daly, described memorably by her as having the “inscrutable suavity which is the mark of a successful Kerryman”, had crowned a life of diplomatic intrigue in Europe by negotiating the marriage of King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza, which restored the old alliance between Portugal and England.

Margaret MacCurtain is survived by a younger sister, Eilis.

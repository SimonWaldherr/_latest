  The infamous NYC 'Black Widow' who ordered a hitman to kill her estranged husband has made parole after 12 years in jail as the victim's furious lover slammed the decision to release her.Millionaire George Kogan, 49, was shot three times by a contract killer hired by estranged wife Barbara Kogan in October 1990.Barbara, who was branded the 'Black Widow' due to the bespoke funereal clothes she wore to court, was only arrested for her involvement in 2008.'Actually, when he was murdered, I was so astounded,' Kogan told two parole board members via videolink from Taconic Correctional Facility in Bedford Hills, New York.The parole board's decision cannot be appealed but Hawkins said her main goal now was to keep Kogan away from the two sons she shared with her late estranged husband.

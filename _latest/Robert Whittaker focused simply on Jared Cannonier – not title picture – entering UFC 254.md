<div><p>ABU DHABI &#8211; <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/robert-whittaker">Robert Whittaker</a> is not too worried about the future at 185 pounds.</p>
<p>The former UFC middleweight champion is focused on one thing only &#8211; Jared Cannonier. Whittaker (21-5 MMA, 12-3 UFC) takes on Cannonier (13-4 MMA, 6-4 UFC) in the co-main event of Saturday&#8217;s UFC 254 pay-per-view event at Flash Forum.</p>
<p>And although many consider the middleweight contest a No. 1 contender bout, it&#8217;s not exactly known what champ Israel Adesanya will do next, as he&#8217;s shown interest in the light heavyweight division, as well as Jon Jones.</p>
<p>Whittaker couldn&#8217;t care less what happens next.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody owes anybody anything,&#8221; Whittaker said in a UFC 254 pre-fight scrum. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to fight Jared right now, and I&#8217;m not thinking about it at all, what (Adesanya) can do. He can fight anyone; I don&#8217;t care. I just want to take this fight, go do my best, and go home and enjoy Christmas.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Whittaker knows he&#8217;s got a strong adversary in front of him, and it&#8217;s exactly the reason why his focus remains solely on Cannonier. Yet, the Australian feels confident in all facets of the game heading into UFC 254.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jared right now is the highest threat level than anyone because he&#8217;s the dude I have to fight,&#8221; Whittaker said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had hard fights, and I expect a hard fight in Jared. He&#8217;s a hard dude. I&#8217;m not sleeping on his skill set. He can beat me. I could lose, but I don&#8217;t think I will.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly respecting his skill set. He&#8217;s very tough, he&#8217;s very powerful, and he&#8217;s resilient. He doesn&#8217;t go away but honestly, I just think I&#8217;m better across the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take this fight wherever I want it to go. I can lead this dance. I think I can sting him, I can knock him out. Honestly, I can do anything, and I have 15 minutes to do that. It&#8217;s better than 25, so I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>

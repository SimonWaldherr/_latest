<div><p>On Nov. 8, 2016, President Donald Trump won an upset victory that blindsided reporters, pundits and much of the American electorate.</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>And this time, Lichtman said seven keys are turned against Trump, which means he will lose the White House.</p><p>"As of late 2019, Trump was down only four keys. It was short of predicting his defeat," Lichtman says. "Everything changed in 2020, with the pandemic and the cries for social and racial justice."</p><p>Lichtman developed his 13 keys in collaboration with the late Vladimir Keilis-Borok, a Russian expert on earthquakes. They analyzed American presidential elections from 1860 to 1980 in seismological terms &#8211; stability indicated the governing party would keep the White House, while an earthquake indicated they would lose it. If six of the 13 keys turned against the governing party, they were in for a loss.</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on the 2020 Election</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/e122dd2/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fdb%2F15%2F841be3fb4587a8ad9b19842d1e3c%2F20201016edptc-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>The 13 keys are based on party mandate &#8211; whether the governing party holds a majority in the House of Representatives after the midterm elections; a heated primary contest within the governing party; incumbency; a strong third-party presence; health of the short-term and long-term economy; sweeping policy change; sustained social unrest; administration scandal; foreign or military failures and successes; the incumbent's charisma; and the challenger's charisma.</p><p>"In 2016, Trump was the challenger," Lichtman says. "I gauged that exactly six keys were turned against the incumbent party, the Democrats. I said that this was going to be a change election &#8211; any generic Republican was going to beat any generic Democrat."</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>And while in 2019 Lichtman's keys predicted a Trump win, the coronavirus pandemic's destruction of the long and short-term economy as well as this summer's protests against racial injustice have put him over the threshold for an impending loss, he says. </p><p>As an incumbent, "The keys are looking at [Trump's] record," Lichtman says. "... this led to my New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/opinion/2020-election-prediction-allan-lichtman.html">prediction</a> that he would be the first incumbent president since George H.W. Bush to lose reelection."</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Even though Lichtman's model was the only one to correctly predict the 2016 race, analysts from other sources maintain their outlook wasn't all that wrong in context. And likewise, they say Trump is set to lose the White House this November.</p><p>On Oct. 20, 2016, Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball proclaimed, "With 19 days to go, Clinton's lead is <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/with-19-days-to-go-clintons-lead-is-bigger-than-ever/">bigger than ever</a>." In their analysis, Sabato, Kyle Kondik and Geoffrey Skelley from the University of Virginia's Center for Politics anticipated that just a few weeks later, Clinton would thrash Trump in the Electoral College vote, 352 to 173.</p><p>Instead, as results came in on election night, Trump carried the Electoral College, with 306 votes to Clinton's 232.</p><p>Looking back, Kondik said that undecided and third-party voters made 2016 especially volatile, and gave Trump a boost in the end. "A lot of people had negative views of both Trump and Clinton," and nearly 6% of voters ended up supporting a third-party, he says. "The people who held unfavorable views of both candidates ended up breaking for Trump."</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>The Crystal Ball predictions are based on polling aggregates between the two candidates, as well as factors like electoral history, candidate quality and reporting. </p><p>On Oct. 13, 2016, Real Clear Politics' <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html#polls">polling average</a> for the race had Clinton up 6.7 points nationally, with 48.1% to Trump's 41.4%. But by Election Day, Trump's deficit had narrowed to just 3.2 points &#8211; within most polls' margin of error.</p><p>Kondik contrasts that campaign with a 2020 race where there are fewer third-party and undecided voters, and "Biden leads have been more and more stable throughout the cycle than in 2016," he says. Kondik also noted that at certain points during the 2016 race, Trump closed his polling deficit with Clinton, but has never gotten particularly close to Biden in national polls this time around.</p><p>"[Trump's] running out of time. Ballots are already being cast," Kondik says. "His approval rating has not been horrible, but not especially good&#8230; The 2018 midterms were bad for him. In 2020, it's been a difficult year for the country. An unpopular incumbent losing in this kind of year makes sense to me."</p><p>On Oct. 15, 2016, FiveThirtyEight was also calling for a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/">Clinton blowout</a>, giving her an 85.5% chance of winning, to Trump's 14.5%. Their <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">current projections</a> for the 2020 race are even more lopsided, anticipating a Biden win in 87 out of 100 possible scenarios.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Despite favoring the wrong outcome in 2016, FiveThirtyEight elections analyst Nathaniel Rakich stands by the essential method of their forecast.</p><p>"Our job is not to predict or call a race, but to describe how likely it is that someone will win," he says. "I would ask people not to think of our forecast in terms of a binary, but we are putting a probability or betting odds on an event. There are two possible outcomes &#8211; Trump could still win reelection [in 2020], but the preponderance of evidence is pointing in the opposite direction."</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Rakich said FiveThirtyEight's methodology is based in large part on inputting polls and calculating averages, while factoring in whether economic indicators favor an incumbent as well as a state's typical partisan alignment.</p><p>Like Kondik, Rakich also says that this year's polling has consistently favored Biden by larger margins than 2016 favored Clinton.</p><p>"Many national polls have Biden ahead by double digits," he says. Rakich described Biden as having, "Big, healthy margins in places like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that decide the Electoral College&#8230; They're tied in Texas, Georgia, Ohio. Basically, an election in which a Democrat is competitive in Texas is not a close election."</p><p>He notes that turnout could be difficult to gauge because of the pandemic and says that FiveThirtyEight's projections have taken the virus into account. Even still, the pandemic has made the model more uncertain than it would be otherwise, Rakich says.</p><p>Despite that, he remains confident that Trump faces daunting odds in his bid for reelection.</p><p>"In 2016 by Election Day, Clinton was maybe 4 points ahead of Trump, which is within range for polling error," Rakich said. "But if the election took place today where Biden is leading by 10 points, there would have to be a really shocking series of events to happen in order for Trump to win."</p><p>This year, both sides are cautioning that the polls could be wrong. Biden's campaign is urging supporters not to get complacent and Trump predicts a red wave. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Analysts are holding firm on their predictions &#8211; and reminding voters that the national polls weren't completely wrong in 2016.<br></p></div>

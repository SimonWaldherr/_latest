John Legend's single "Never Break" has taken on new meaning in his personal life.

Just two weeks after suffering a pregnancy loss, Legend returned to the stage during the Billboard Music Awards Wednesday for an emotional performance of the ballad from his "Bigger Love" album.

Seated behind a black piano in an all-white tuxedo, Legend dedicated "Never Break" to his wife, Chrissy Teigen.

"This is for Chrissy," he whispered before belting out the powerful lyrics as his voice appeared to ache: "We got a good thing, babe. Whenever life is hard. We'll never lose our way. 'Cause we both know who we are."

Kelly Clarkson, the host of the Billboard Music Awards and fellow "Voice" judge, said her colleague's "very special performance" was "possibly my favorite of the night."

"He and Chrissy just have this warm way of inviting us into their world, the highs and the lows," Clarkson said while introducing Legend. "Our hearts go out to you both in this very difficult time and I'm thankful that you continue to share your light and your talent with all of us."

Following his pre-taped performance, Clarkson added, "John, that was so beautiful… All my love to you and Chrissy."

'On this darkest of days, we will grieve': Chrissy Teigen, John Legend suffer pregnancy loss

This marked Legend's first performance since he and Teigen lost their third child, a son they named Jack, in late September. Teigen announced the news on Instagram.

"We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before," Teigen wrote. "Everyday can’t be full of sunshine. On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it."

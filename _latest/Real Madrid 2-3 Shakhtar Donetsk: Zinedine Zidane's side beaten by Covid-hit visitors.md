  Real Madrid 2-3 Shakhtar Donetsk: Zinedine Zidane's side beaten by Covid-hit visitors 
description: > 
  Shakhtar Donetsk stunned Real Madrid with a 3-2 victory that sends Zinedine Zidane’s team into Saturday’s meeting with Barcelona off the back of two humbling defeats.Shakhtar had tired after their brilliant first half but there were still wide open spaces to be exploited in the Madrid half and Tete's stamina was holding out.'We improved in the second half but it was not enough,' said Modric.That sounded strange coming from a Real Madrid player.It had been a strange game with Shakhtar brilliant and Madrid dozy, decadent and justifiably defeated.

He first bypassed Militao's timid challenge, he was then quicker to ball than Raphael Varane, and when Marcelo dived in, he left Tete free to convert once Korniienko had poked the ball to him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second goal came on 33 minutes and Marcelo's wing was the scene of the crime. Soloman cut in from the right with various players in white shirts spectating. His fierce left foot shot was pushed out by Courtois but only as far as Varane who prodded it past his own keeper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Soloman got the third and again Madrid were training cones as Shakhtar stormed forward. The Israeli international started the move in his own half getting away from Rodrigo and Casemiro. He then fed Tete and continued his run. Tete dragged Marcelo one way and then back-heeled the ball the other way leaving Soloman to sweep it past Courtois. No one had tracked his lung-busting run.</p><img id="i-f1377b89d352ab7b" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="398" width="634" alt="Tete got Shakhtar off to a great start when he drilled an effort into the bottom right corner" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f1377b89d352ab7b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/19/34674170-8863897-image-a-5_1603306715619.jpg" height="398" width="634" alt="Tete got Shakhtar off to a great start when he drilled an effort into the bottom right corner" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Tete got Shakhtar off to a great start when he drilled an effort into the bottom right corner</p><img id="i-9bb14ac516d28d53" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="383" width="634" alt="Thibaut Courtois goes to pick the ball out of his net after Raphael Varane's own goal" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-9bb14ac516d28d53" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/20/34676732-8863897-image-a-20_1603306881411.jpg" height="383" width="634" alt="Thibaut Courtois goes to pick the ball out of his net after Raphael Varane's own goal" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Thibaut Courtois goes to pick the ball out of his net after Raphael Varane's own goal</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zidane took four players off at half time on Saturday with Real Madrid 1-0 down in La Liga against Cadiz .

  Rudy Giuliani turns over alleged Hunter Biden laptop to authorities in Delaware 
description: > 
  – Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to tarnish Joe Biden’s presidential campaign continued in Delaware when he visited a police station Monday to share files from what he said was Hunter Biden’s laptop.Last Wednesday,Delaware computer repairman John Paul Mac Isaac claimed that in April 2019 a man who identified himself as Hunter Biden brought a liquid-damaged MacBook Pro to his small repair shop.Mac Isaac said his poor vision prevented him from personally identifying the man as Hunter Biden.While they found Hunter Biden's business made State Department official's work awkward, they found no evidence that Joe Biden acted inappropriately.On Tuesday, Giuliani appeared on former-Trump advisor Steve Bannon's radio show and said he had information of criminal activity relating to Hunter Biden.

The star teamed the racy item of clothing with sheer patterned knickers which had two silk ties on the side.

Rita added a collection of jewellery which included a stack of silver necklaces with one featuring a diamond encrusted cross.

The singer oozed Hollywood glamour as she styled her blonde locks into a curly blow-dried hairdo and added a slick of glamorous make-up.

Rita captioned the photos with: 'After work glam feeling myself @blairbbrown ! happy Friday.'

It comes after the star recently sparked engagement rumours with boyfriend Romain Gavras after she was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her wedding finger.

Rita was spotted wearing her ring when she left Mexican restaurant Taqueria in London, and flashed her dazzling jewel at photographers last Friday.

A diner at restaurant told The Sun on Sunday: 'Rita was showing off the ring on Thursday with the women seemingly cooing over it.

'She seemed in high spirits when she left the restaurant and then shoved her hand in her pocket.'

While James Constantinou of Prestige Pawnbrokers said Rita's new piece of jewellery appeared to be a sapphire and diamond cluster ring, which if an antique piece, could cost around Â£50,000.

However despite the speculation, a source close to Rita told the publication that the singer has simply treated herself to a new flashy piece of vintage jewellery.

MailOnline contacted Romain Gavras representative for a comment while Rita's spokesperson declined to comment.

Rita has been dating Greek-French director Romain, 39, for the past few months after they were first seen together in July after a night of partying.

Speaking to The Sun, friends insisted she was involved with the filmmaker after she was seen enjoying a boozy night out with business tycoon Faton Gashi.

A source said: 'Rita was hitting the town with friends including Faton. But she's in a serious thing with Romain and properly loved up. It's the first time she's been serious with someone in ages.'

Her previous boyfriends include Calvin Harris, Andrew Garfield, Rob Kardashian, musician Andrew Watt and Ricky Hil - the son of fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.

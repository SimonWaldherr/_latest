Day 2 of Amy Coney Barrett's Senate confirmation hearing

The confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrettresumes Tuesday, led by the Senate Judiciary Committee. While Monday's hearing consisted of opening remarks, things are expected to heat up on Tuesday. Senators will question Barrett on her career and her position on issues that could come before the court, including health care, guns, abortion and religion.

It's Day 2 of campaign rallies for President Trump

President Donald Trump will host a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Tuesday as part of a string of ralliesfollowing the president's bout with COVID-19. Claiming he is both cured and "immune" to the deadly virus, Trump held a rally in Florida on Monday – just a week-and-a-half after testing positive. "I just feel so powerful," he said. "I'll kiss everyone in that audience." However, lingering questions remain about Trump's health. White House physician Sean Conley said Monday that Trump has tested negative for COVID-19 "on consecutive days" – he didn't say which ones or how many – and "the President is not infectious to others." With the election just weeks away, numerous polls have found that Trump is trailing Democratic challenger Joe Biden nationally.

Five men accused in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will appear in federal court Tuesday for a hearing on whether they should be detained before trial. The proceeding for Michigan residents Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta will take place in Grand Rapids. A sixth man, Barry Croft, was being held in Delaware. Some defendants conducted coordinated surveillance of the Democratic governor's vacation home in northern Michigan in August and September, a criminal complaint states. The FBI has revealed the suspected plot also involved a "plan to target and kill police," prompting state law enforcement to say it is on high alert. "This is one of the tactics these anti-government, domestic terrorism groups use," said 1st Lt. Mike Shaw of the Michigan State Police. "Law enforcement is the face of the government. If you're mad at the government, you're mad at the police."

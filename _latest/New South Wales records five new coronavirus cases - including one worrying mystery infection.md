New South Wales has recorded five new coronavirus cases on Sunday including one mystery infection.

Three of the new cases were locally acquired, with two linked to known clusters and the source of the third under investigation.

NSW Health said anyone who attended Lakemba Radiology in Sydney's south-west between 12.00pm and 2.30pm on October 1 is considered a casual contact.

Attendees should monitor for symptoms carefully and if they develop be tested for COVID-19 immediately and self-isolate.

The two other cases are returned travellers in hotel quarantine.

There are 55 cases being treated by NSW Health, with just one in intensive care who does not require ventilation.

There were 12,823 tests conducted over the 24-hour reporting period, with the five cases bringing the state total from the pandemic to 4,088.

Authorities have also updated health advice for passengers who rode a train replacement bus service from Central at 11.48pm on October 4 to Strathfield at 12.15am on October 5.

Passengers are now considered close contacts and must immediately be tested for COVID-19 and self isolate for 14 days from the time of travel.

They must remain in isolation for 14 days regardless of their test result.

NSW Health are continuing to encourage people to be tested for COVID-19 even if they only experience mild symptoms.

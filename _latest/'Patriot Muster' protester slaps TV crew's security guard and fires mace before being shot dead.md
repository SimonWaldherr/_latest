A stunning series of images captured the moment a private security guard working for a television crew shot and killed a man believed to be part of a right-wing 'Patriot Muster' rally outside the Denver Art Museum.

The security guard, who was hired by 9News and has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday evening after he opened fire on the unidentified Patriot Muster protester who deployed mace at him during the rally.

In images snapped by a Denver Post photographer, the protester appeared to slap the security guard and then deployed a stream of mace into his face before the guard lifted his handgun and fired, sending the protester staggering backward.

Witnesses said the two men, both white, had engaged in a heated verbal altercation prior to the shooting. The protester was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Video showed police swarming the security guard seconds after he opened fire. The guard surrendered immediately, dropping to his knees and placing his weapon on the ground.

The Denver Police Department (DPD) said the shooter had no affiliation with a group of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters who had turned out at the art museum to face off with the Patriot Muster crowd.

9News confirmed that it had hired the guard through the private Pinkerton detective agency to watch over its staff during Saturday's dueling protests between pro-police groups under the name Patriot Muster and a 'BLM-Antifa Soup Drive'.

'A 9NEWS employee and a 9NEWS contractor were taken into custody,' the station reported, adding that the contractor was deemed to be not involved in the shooting.

'The private security guard was contracted through Pinkerton by 9NEWS. It has been the practice of 9NEWS for a number of months to hire private security to accompany staff at protests.'

Police had deployed in large numbers for Saturday's rival rallies. When gunfire rang out at 3.37pm local time more than a dozen officers rushed to the scene to detain the shooter.

The security guard still had his handgun in his grasp when riot police swarmed him with guns pointed. He was filmed falling to his knees as he dropped his weapon and raised his arms above his head.

He was arrested, along with the 9News producer who was later cleared of involvement in the shooting.

The victim was reportedly shot at point-blank range and was taken to a hospital where he later died, Joe Montoya, chief of DPD's investigations division, said at a news conference on Saturday evening.

'There was a verbal altercation that transpired at the area of the shooting,' Montoya said. He declined to connect the gunman and the victim with the protests until the police finished their investigation.

Two guns were recovered at the scene, Montoya said.

The DPD confirmed on Twitter that the shooting was being investigated as a homicide.

The victim was seen wearing a shirt that said 'BLM' followed by an obscene phrase that appeared to mock the Black Lives Matter movement. The shirt was partially obscured by his sleeveless military vest.

Both the victim and the gunman were white men, Montoya said. They were not publicly identified by the authorities.

Richard Johnson, who witnessed the shooting, told CBS4 he saw nothing leading up to it that was out of the ordinary.

'I'm wondering what possible explanation there could be,' Johnson said.

'There didn't seem to be any altercation, there wasn't any yelling coming from that way, the victim didn't seem to be advancing on him in a menacing way.

'He is a large man. But I suspect when this all shakes out it may be something other than what we might think at first.'

Rival rallies - which have became a common sight in Denver over the summer - had been called for Saturday afternoon by the opposing groups Patriot Muster and BLM/Antifa groups.

John Tiegen, an ex-Marine and Blackwater private security guard, is credited as the founder of Patriot Muster, which is comprised of pro-police activists.

Tiegen had summoned his followers to the Denver Civic Center park for a 2pm rally under the slogan: 'Stand up, show up.'

The slogan bore similarities to President Donald Trump's response when asked to condemn white supremacists and the Proud Boys. Instead of disavowing them he said: 'Stand back and stand by.'

WHO ARE THE 'PATRIOT MUSTER' PROTESTERS? Patriot Muster is the name given to pro-police activists who have attended rallies organized by John Tiegen, an ex-Marine and Blackwater private security guard. The group was formed over the summer as Denver, along with dozens of other cities across the US, was roiled by protests against racism and police brutality. Patriot Muster made headlines in July when it hosted a 'Back the Blue' rally that descended into chaos when protesters began clashing with counter-protesters. Tiegen accused the counter-protesters of throwing soup cans at his followers. Tiegen organized another Patriot Muster rally on Saturday at the Denver Civic Center, under the slogan: 'Stand up, show up.' The slogan bore similarities to President Donald Trump's response when asked to condemn white supremacists and the Proud Boys. Instead of disavowing them he said: 'Stand back and stand by.' Black Lives Matter protesters led by the Denver Communists responded by creating their own rally in the same location, dubbed the 'BLM-Antifa Soup Drive'. The 'soup rally' was meant to be ironic in response to Tiegen accusing leftist protesters of throwing cans. Tiegen foreshadowed violence at the event on Friday, telling KNUS: 'I'm not going in there to do violence, but I'm going to be prepared to do violence.' Advertisement

'Join myself and hundreds of fellow Patriot Americans for a Muster at Civic Center Park 2pm sharp,' Tiegen wrote on Instagram.

'Don't let the communists, socialist party and groups intimidate or Oppress you any longer! Come join us and be heard & seen and celebrate OUR freedoms.'

Tiegen foreshadowed violence at the event on Friday, telling KNUS: 'I'm not going in there to do violence, but I'm going to be prepared to do violence.'

BLM-Antifa organized their own rally in the same spot, at 1.30pm - telling their supporters: 'Counter protest the fascist rally nearby!'

Chelsea Jacobs, a member of the Denver Communists, said that Saturday's event, dubbed a BLM-Antifa Soup Drive', had been organized in response to the Patriot Muster.

The 'soup rally' was meant to be ironic in response to comments that far-left protesters throw soup cans, she said.

When Saturday afternoon arrived, right-leaning protesters rallied by Tiegen congregated inside the Civic Center's amphitheater while left-leaning protesters gathered outside.

One member of the BLM-Antifa crowd burnt the blue-colored Stars and Stripes flag used by pro-police groups, pouring lighter fluid over it and setting it ablaze at the feet of the DPD officers.

Large numbers of officers attempted to keep the two sides apart.

Police were not letting anyone else into amphitheater area, but by 3.30pm, the Denver Post reported, the barrier appeared to be coming down.

Police fired what appeared to be pepper balls into the crowd, after people from the leftist group started rattling the barrier headed into the amphitheater.

This isn't the first time that Tiegen's sympathizers have clashed with left-wing counterprotesters. Similar unrest unfolded on July 20 at a 'Back the Blue' rally organized by Tiegen.

Tiegen, the Patriot Muster organizer, said the BLM-Antifa protesters started throwing soup cans at the police.

Police expected there to be trouble. In previous weeks they have asked organizers to cancel or postpone their rallies, to try and tone down tension.

Ahead of Saturday's rallies, they issued a statement saying the department 'respects the right to peacefully assemble'.

They continued: 'Those who participate in protests, demonstrations, marches, or other gatherings, as protected by the First Amendment, are reminded to do so in a lawful manner.

'Individuals who choose to act outside of local, state and federal law, will be subject to citation or arrest.'

Tiegen is the author of the book 13 Hours, detailing the botched Benghazi raid, which was turned into a film.

Tiegen spent four years in the Marines and then several years as a security contractor with Blackwater Security on missions in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, he says on his website.

Tiegen then worked for the CIA on their Global Response Staff, deployed to 40 countries around the world.

He was in Libya in September 2011 when the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi was attacked, and four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, killed.

He received the Award for Heroism and Valor for his bravery that night.

Back in his native Colorado, Tiegen has carved out a career for himself as a motivational speaker.

He regularly appears on television and radio to discuss his views.

On Saturday he said his Facebook page had been taken down.

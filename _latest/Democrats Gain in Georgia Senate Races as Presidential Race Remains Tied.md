    <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Trump&#8217;s resilience among white voters without a degree defies the trend elsewhere in the country. National and battleground state polls suggest that Mr. Biden has made significant gains among the group, imperiling the president&#8217;s hold on the Northern battleground states that decided the last election.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But the Deep South has been a notable exception to those Biden gains in Times/Siena polling. Mr. Trump retains the backing of 96 percent of the white voters without a college degree who said they voted for him four years ago, matching his prior highs of 96 percent loyalty among white voters without a degree in prior Times/Siena surveys of Texas and South Carolina.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Outside the Deep South, Mr. Trump holds a relatively smaller 89-5 lead among white voters without a degree who say they backed Mr. Trump in 2016.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As a result, Mr. Trump holds a 65-28 lead among white voters in Georgia, an advantage that could prove to be just enough for the president to win &#8212; depending on Mr. Biden&#8217;s strength among nonwhite voters.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The survey finds that voters who described themselves as Black on their voter registration form were poised to represent 29 percent of the electorate, above their 27.6 percent share in 2016 and comparable to their 28.7 percent share in the 2018 midterms, but beneath their 30 percent share of registered voters today or their share of the 2008 and 2012 electorates.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Over all, 80 percent of white voters said they were &#8220;almost certain&#8221; to vote or had already done so, compared with 77 percent of Black voters.</p></div>

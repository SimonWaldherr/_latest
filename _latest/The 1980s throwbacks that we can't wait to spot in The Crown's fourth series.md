The Crown is back for a fourth season next month, which means many things, not least total immersion in our Eighties memories, including Diana’s wedding dress which – seen from the back in the trailer – has already got the synapses popping.

Funny that you instantly recall how the dress seemed to weigh her down, though the scale of it was normal for the day; and it’s a short step from that to remembering our own Walter Raleigh knickerbockers, leg-of-­mutton sleeve blouses and strapless puffball dresses.

Here are some other things from the early Eighties that we are looking forward to spotting:

Bopping: (1980s dancing Sloane style.) For Prince Andrew’s 21st in 1981 they had a party at Windsor Castle during which Elton John danced to Bill Haley with Princess Anne and the Queen. Doubtless this will be too much of an effort to reconstruct for TV, but bopping is well worth revisiting for laughs and because it helps recreate that peculiar cocktail of formalish dress, smart surroundings and acrobatic high jinks.

Cocktails: Big creamy white Russians the size of a baby’s head decorated with sparklers, and two for one during happy hour.

Lavish tights: It’s often been said that although men are not, as a rule, mad for women’s tights, they very much made an exception for dotty sheer tights, ones with seams and bows, and particularly black lacy tights, which were pretty great now that we come to think of it.

Golf GTIs, with a tape deck on which you might be playing The Cars or Talk Talk, while driving at any speed you liked, smoking Silk Cut and eating Wotsits.

Rag Rolling and stencilling: very hard to remember what possessed us, but who didn’t have a peach stippled wall with some pineapples stencilled above the picture rail, or a mural in the bathroom featuring clouds and a cypress tree?

The Jane Fonda Workout tape: which she did wearing a leotard and leg warmers and the rest of us did wearing last night’s eyeliner and pyjamas. No “athleisurewear” in those days, as you may recall, or “­loungewear” or even exercisewear, bar leotards – not that we knew of.

Monty Don: I mention this because not nearly enough people are fully aware that Monty (of gardening and dogs fame) produced the most coveted costume jewellery of the early 1980s – pearl drop earrings topped off with a bow and a pearl stud, and Diana definitely had a couple of pairs.

Brideshead Revisited: Very big deal at the time, huge, and seems likely the Queen was watching, if not some of the others.

Dinner Parties: three courses, stew, peas, banoffee pie, 10 people crammed around a table all of them wearing scarves (New Romantic) also because the heating was not all that…three times a week.

Skiing: Here’s hoping we get a glimpse of Di and Fergie on top of a mountain wearing padded ski suits and bobble hats, killing some time before heading to The Farm Club. It wouldn’t be the 1980s without a skiing holiday in Verbier, would it?

Is it just me…

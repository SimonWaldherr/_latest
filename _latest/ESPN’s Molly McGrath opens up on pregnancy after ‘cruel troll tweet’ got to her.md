<p>With over 78,000 Instagram followers and counting, ESPN&#8217;s Molly McGrath is used to the online commentary about her life. But as the mom-to-be recently revealed, one troll took their criticism a step too far.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time, maybe ever, I let a cruel troll tweet about the changes of my pregnant body get to me,&#8221; McGrath, 31, penned in an Instagram post this month.</p>
<p>McGrath, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFZ5eh7nxYK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who announced last month</a> that she and husband Max Dorsch are expecting, opened up about a rough night she endured, in which she stood on her feet &#8220;for over six hours straight, in the rain&#8221; with minimal sleep. McGrath added that while the experience hasn&#8217;t been easy, she is &#8220;proud to be a pregnant woman working full-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the thing: being pregnant is hard, especially as I enter my third trimester. My feet swell and hurt like I&#8217;ve never imagined and my back constantly aches. Not to mention the slew of other symptoms like nausea, heartburn, and exhaustion. I am making a HUMAN LIFE! The baby I&#8217;m carrying around could live outside of my body right now, and my strong ass body made that baby from scratch,&#8221; McGrath detailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Completely separately, the job of a sideline reporter is also hard with the travel, prep, hustle to get information, and reality that we never get into a broadcast as much as we could have contributed. But you know what, I wouldn&#8217;t change ANY of my circumstances in a second,&#8221; she continued.</p>
 
<p>McGrath, who is part of ESPN&#8217;s college football and basketball broadcasts, added how she feels &#8220;so incredibly lucky to have a job that I&#8217;m so passionate about, it makes me forget that a little human is kicking my ribs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am proud to be a pregnant woman working full-time and I am proud that the monstrosity of creating a human life has not, and will not, slow me down,&#8221; McGrath said. &#8220;Women are freaking incredible and powerful and anyone who doesn&#8217;t see that can kiss my big achey butt.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>McGrath then received a slew of positive messages from fans, who celebrated her for speaking out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love you and this!!! Every word rings true!!! You are a freaking warrior ! And gorgeous to boot!&#8221; one follower wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;So very proud of you!! How lucky is that baby to learn from and have a mom like you!? &#8221; another wrote.</p>
<p>McGrath&#8217;s husband Dorsch also posted an empowering message to his wife and fellow moms-to-be.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Molly and all the future moms who are reading this,&#8221; Dorsch wrote on his Instagram story. &#8220;It&#8217;s natural and okay to have moments of insecurity as your body changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But never forget to be proud and have some. fun showing off! You&#8217;re doing something no man can do. We salute you, miracle workers!&#8221; he continued.</p>

The alternate captain led the team this season in shots (226) and first goals (5), and ranked second with a +9 differential.

In eight NHL seasons with the Canadiens, Gallagher has registered 334 points (173 goals, 161 assists) in 547 regular season games. With 173 tallies with Montreal, the Edmonton, AB native ranks 17th in goals scored in team history among wingers, and 30th among all players.

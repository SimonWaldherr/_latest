Brooklyn Assemblywoman Diana Richardson defended severe corporal punishment of her child during a 15-minute video tirade she produced on social media.

Richardson’s Facebook Live rant was triggered by her protest of the media outlet City&State for putting her on a list of politicians it had once honored who it says have since “crashed, burned and flamed out.”

“They had the nerve to put Diana Richardson on the crash, burn elected official list,” Richardson said, referring to herself in the third person.

But what really outraged Richardson is that the outlet recycled her 2017 criminal case when Richardson was accused of beating her 12-year-old son with a broomstick in its summary of her fall from grace on the list.

Richardson said she’s being unfairly portrayed as an “angry black woman.”

“It’s really, really frustrating,” she said.

Toward the end of her videotape, Richardson defended whupping kids as a form of discipline.

“I’m Caribbean! We discipline our children,” Richardson said, making a broad characterization.

“If I was not elected and I tap up my son’s ass, I’ll just call it what it is. I beat him,” said the pol, who represents the central Brooklyn neighborhoods of Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Wingate and Prospect-Lefferts Gardens.

“And I grew up receiving plenty lickings and I’m doing real good right now. So don’t come to judge me and judge my family. I’m sick of it. It is disrespectful,” she went on.

Richardson repeatedly said she’s a “strong black woman” who is “unafraid” and stands up for her constituents, and that’s all that matters.

“I feel pretty good about me,” she said.

Richardson’s video is just her the latest in a string of tirades and confrontations that has stirred controversy.

She apologized after slamming Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) during a closed-door meeting with the Democratic caucus members in 2018. Other Assembly members described her outburst as a rude tantrum.

Richardson was also accused of blaming Jews for gentrification in her district.

She also tried to shame a parking enforcement agent who gave her a ticket for illegally parking her car.

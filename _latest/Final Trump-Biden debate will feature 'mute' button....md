<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">President Trump's campaign has vehemently objected to news that his final debate against&#160;Democratic rival Joe Biden will feature a mute button, which will turn off candidates' microphones to prevent them talking over each other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the president has said he will still attend the debate for an&#160;opportunity to discuss Hunter Biden's email scandal.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Presidential Commission on Debates said each candidate's microphone at the debate in Nashville, Tennessee, would be silenced to allow the other to make two minutes of opening remarks at the beginning of each 15-minute segment of the debate.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both microphones will be turned on to allow a back-and-forth after that time.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Monday, the Trump campaign voiced objections to the change,&#160;but said the Republican would still take part in the Thursday night event - one of his last chances to reach a large prime-time audience before voting ends on November 3.</p><img id="i-729587cad861178c"

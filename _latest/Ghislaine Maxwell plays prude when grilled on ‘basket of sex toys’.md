<div><p>Ghislaine Maxwell tried to pass herself off as a prude &#8212; by balking at questions about a &#8220;laundry basket of sex toys&#8221; and nude photos &#8212; in a 2016 deposition <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/22/ghislaine-maxwells-deposition-about-sordid-sex-life-unsealed/">that was made public</a> Thursday.</p>
<p>The 465-page transcript of the deposition includes hundreds of denials from the longtime Jeffrey Epstein associate, who claimed she knew nothing about his alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.</p>
<p>Maxwell also squirmed when probed about her sex life during the seven-hour grilling session by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre&#8217;s lawyer, Sigrid McCawley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have a basket of sex toys that you kept in the Palm Beach house?&#8221; McCawley asked.</p>
<p>The question was followed by several objections from Maxwell&#8217;s lawyer, with McCawley repeatedly rephrasing the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to define what are you talking about,&#8221; Maxwell answered at one point.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sex toy meaning a vibrator of some kind, sometimes they are called dildos, of that nature, anything like that?&#8221; the lawyer asked.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/article/who-is-ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-confidante/">British socialite</a> &#8212; who <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/04/nyc-woman-says-ghislaine-maxwell-gagged-and-raped-her/">has been accused of &#8220;gagging and raping&#8221;</a> one victim with a sex toy &#8212; replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t recollect anything that would formally be a dildo, anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you describe sex toys?&#8221; McCawley followed up, to which Maxwell answered, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t describe sex toys.&#8221;</p>
<p>A transcript of the marathon deposition was ordered unsealed by an appeals court earlier this week, in a decision that upheld a previous one by Manhattan federal Judge Loretta Preska. It was taken as part of a since-settled defamation case filed against Maxwell by Giuffre, a longtime Epstein accuser.</p>
<p>McCawley also grilled Maxwell on whether she took nude photos of Epstein&#8217;s alleged underage victims.</p>
<p>She answered by saying it was possible she took pictures of people &#8220;that were somehow semi or had some clothing on or no clothes on&#8221; but claimed that &#8220;at no time were any of these pictures remotely inappropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, she insisted any photos she took were family friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The types of &#8212; first, I took very few and they were always by request, this was a picture you could put on your &#8212; gift to your parent or to your grandparents to put on their mantel piece,&#8221; Maxwell said. &#8220;It would be a very benign sort of attractive picture where you wouldn&#8217;t see anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point deep into the deposition, Maxwell lost her cool during a line of questioning of whether she first met Giuffre at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, where Epstein had a mansion.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I am going to put on the record, Ms. Maxwell very inappropriately and very harshly pounded our law firm table in an inappropriate manner,&#8221; McCawley noted for the record. &#8220;I ask she take a deep breath, and calm down. I know this is a difficult position but physical assault or threats is not appropriate, so no pounding, no stomping, no, that&#8217;s not appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell piped up, &#8220;Can we be clear, I didn&#8217;t threaten anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maxwell, 58, is behind bars awaiting trial on charges she<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/02/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-associate-arrested/"> recruited and groomed young women</a> to be sexually abused by her and Epstein &#8212; the convicted pedophile <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/10/convicted-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-dead/">who committed suicide</a> in jail last year.</p>
<p>Giuffre has long claimed she was forced to have sex with Epstein as a teen and pimped out to his powerful pals, including Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>The royal has denied the allegations.</p>

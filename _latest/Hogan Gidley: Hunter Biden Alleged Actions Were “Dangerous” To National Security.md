<p>"The e-mails come out showing he knows he knew the whole time, Joe Biden did, about this nefarious deal. These millions of dollars of contracts, and while he was Vice President, was asked to build relationships with Ukraine and China. Well, what do you know? His family gets lucrative multi-million-dollar contracts because of his position trading off the family name. I mean, that's dangerous from a national security standpoint. It's problematic, could be illegal on some level, depending on how far and how deep this whole thing goes."</p>
<p>"The Deep State is real. While there have been people at the FBI, a vast majority of them who work hard for the American people, who work hard for this country, love this nation, and have sacrificed so much to protect us. There are some people at the top of who've clearly done some wrong things. Think about if Donald Trump hadn't been elected, we wouldn't know Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, we wouldn't know the names of Comey and Clapper and Brennan and all the other folks running around the government trying to impose a political will on the American people with mobilization or utilization of an entire arm of the federal government. So thankfully, he did win and we've drain the swamp, but there's still a few creatures slinking around out there, we need another four years to clean it all up totally. And I think we're going to get it."</p>

On the right track: When it comes to questions relating to looking after your car, there is nowhere better turn to than Kwik Fit, the UK's largest vehicle maintenance and repair retailer

HOW DO I CHANGE A TYRE?

Changing a tyre is something all drivers should know how to do, but the reality is it remains a mystery to many of us. Fortunately Kwik Fit, the UK's leading tyre retailer, has simplified it down to eight simple steps that anyone can follow.

Before you start... Assess your current situation and ask yourself the following questions: Have I stopped the car in the best place? Is it out of the way of other vehicles? Am I visible to other drivers? Can I safely change the tyre here If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to all of the above, then you should apply the handbrake, put the hazard warning lights on and place your warning triangle on the road behind your car. Any passengers must get out of the vehicle. Make sure you have to correct tools. You will need: A car jack

A wrench

A couple of wheel chocks

A wheel nut key

Your car handbook

A torch (if you’re changing the tyre at night) You should also check that your spare tyre is in good condition. For more information visit Kwik Fit's Tyre Information Hub here.

1. Use the wheel chocks to stabilise the vehicle: Wheel chocks should be put in place to prevent the car from rolling while it is jacked up. They should be positioned diagonally opposite the wheel that is flat. If you don’t have a chock, bricks or a large plank of wood will work in the same way.

2. Position the car jack: Each car is different, so you may need to refer to your car’s handbook to determine the best place to position the jack. If you can’t find this information, it’s preferable to put it in the lifting point that’s closest to the wheel you’re changing. Check that the head engages properly and extend the jack slowly until the vehicle has risen slightly but the wheels are still on the floor.

3. Loosen the wheel nuts: It’s safest to loosen the wheel nuts while the tyres are still grounded. This can be done using the wheel wrench. Apply it to the wheel nut and turn the wrench to the left. When the nut is loose enough to be removed by hand, keep it in position and move onto the next one. Do not remove the nuts yet.

4. Jack the car up: Now that you’ve loosened (but not removed) your wheel nuts, you can jack the car up fully. Do this slowly until the vehicle is around 10cm off the ground.

5. Remove the tyre: Remove the wheel nuts by hand, holding the weight of the tyre with your knee so it doesn’t fall off and hurt you. It’s a good idea to take the top nut off last. Once this final nut is removed, the tyre should slide out of position. Place it flat on the ground out of your way.

6. Fit the spare tyre: The spare tyre can be fitted by holding it in place and reattaching the wheel nuts. The nuts only need to be secured by hand for the time being, so tighten them until each one can support the weight of the tyre. Once this is done, lower the jack carefully until the wheel is just touching the ground.

7. Tighten the wheel nuts: The nuts need to be tightened again using the wrench. This time, turn the wrench to the right, making sure that each nut is fully secured.

8. Lower the car to the ground: It’s now safe to lower the car to the ground fully and remove the jack. Once this is done, recheck the nuts to ensure they’re still tightly secured. If you have a tyre pressure gauge, it’s a good idea to test the pressure of the spare tyre. If you don’t have one, drive to the nearest garage to check the air.

And remember: If you're worried about the condition of your tyres, pay a visit to one of Kwik Fit's 600 centres for a free tyre check and put your mind at ease. Click here to find your nearest centre.

HOW DO I PLAN THE PERFECT STAYCATION?

Family fun! Whether it's a weekend away or a longer holiday, asking friends and loved ones is the best place to start when it comes to planning your perfect staycation. Before you head off, make sure you follow Kwik Fit's 10-step checklist to ensure your car is working properly

The ongoing Covid-19 crisis means many of us are ditching overseas holidays in favour of Great British staycations a little closer to home. But how do you start to plan a trip that's perfect for you and your family?

A great place to start is to ask friends and loved ones for their recommendations. Not only will they give you honest answers about what they liked and didn't like about the holiday, but they will be able to keep your individual interests and hobbies in mind.

If you are getting away with the kids then it's a good idea to speak to other parents with children of similar ages and ask them for their tips on day trips and activities that the whole family can enjoy.

Once you've decided where you would like to go, take a look for discounts to help save money. There are deals to be had on everything from accommodation to activities and even restaurant meals, so it is well worth taking some time to scroll through dedicated discount websites and money-saving Facebook groups to find the ones that best suit you.

Once you've found them, double check to see if you need to do anything to meet the requirements – like booking in advance, visiting on a certain day, or spending a certain amount - so you are not caught off guard on holiday.

While you might not want to plan a full itinerary, it is a good idea to spend some time thinking about restaurants, parks and popular tourist attractions you might want to visit and book in advance to ensure aren't left disappointed.

Finally before you head off for your jaunt, it is also important to make sure your car is up to the journey. There is nothing like a flat tyre or flashing warning light to put an end to your carefree holiday spirit!

Kwik Fit has put together a list of 10 essential car checks that all drivers should carry out before their next getaway, from checking your coolant levels to refilling your screenwash and making sure your lights are working properly. For the full list -and the best way to carry out the checks - click here.

HOW CAN I SAVE MORE MONEY?

Putting away the pennies: Save money by assessing, prioritising and evaluating how much money you spend on each area of your life, whether that is meals out or energy bills

From a meal out to new school shoes, the never-ending list of ways we can spend our money means saving can sometimes feel like an impossible task.

Financial experts and hotlines are a great place to turn if you are looking for advice on how to cut back on your costs.

Another helpful way to start is to break down your spending into key areas - like your house, car or leisure, and look at how much goes on each.

This makes it easier to see, prioritise and evaluate your outgoings.

If you are spending more on your home than you would like, you might want to consider switching energy suppliers or think about upgrading your boiler to one that's more efficient. Meanwhile growing 'leisure' costs might mean you consider limiting the number of meals out you eat each month, or trips to the shops.

Another significant cost for many people is their car, which is why it's important to know you're getting the best deal possible on your vehicle's maintenance and servicing needs. Kwik Fit offers great online deals on a wide range of tyres and batteries as well as other essentials so you know you're getting high quality products at competitive prices.

Kwik Fit also helps you save money by offering a number of free checks, as well as deals like the combined MOT test and service. You can learn more here.

There are also small steps that everyone can take to reduce the cost of running a car, like ensuring the correct tyre pressure is maintained, which will help your car run efficiently. Kwik Fit has information on all of this and other efficiency-related questions - like how much fuel air con uses - on its website.

HOW DO I IMPRESS IN MY NEXT BIG JOB INTERVIEW?

Ready for anything: The key to succeeding in that next big interview is to come well prepared

The internet is full of hints and tips on how to make the best first impression and dazzle in your next interview but these are some that work no matter what the role.

1. Arrive on time: It might sound simple but arriving promptly for an interview is a quick and easy way to signal to the interviewer that you are serious about the role and possess good time-keeping skills.

Try doing a trial run of the route ahead of time to make sure you know where you're going. It's also worth checking that your car is working smoothly a few days before the big interview so you have time to make any repairs. Drivers that don't use their car often should be particularly aware of the potential for battery problems. Think your car might be at risk? Book in for a Free Battery Health Check with Kwik Fit here.

2. Do your research: Make sure you have looked into the company, the role and, if possible, the interviewer before you step into the room so you are ready to field whatever questions come your way.

3. Come with questions: Most interviewers will give the candidate an opportunity to ask questions at the end of the interview. Insightful, intelligent questions are a sure-fire way to communicate that you are engaged, committed and well-informed.

WHEN DOES MY CAR NEED ITS SERVICE AND MOT TEST?

Why 12 is the magic number: According to Kwik Fit, a good general rule of thumb is to take your car for a full service every 12,000 miles or every 12 months, whichever comes sooner

From catching a flight to that early morning meeting, we rely on our cars to make the most important journeys of our day. That's why it is so important to keep it running as safely and smoothly as possible. The best way to do this is to take it for a service on a regular basis.

Service vs MOT test: What's the difference? Servicing and MOT tests are familiar terms to many drivers but many of us don't know the difference. Kwik Fit, the UK's No. 1 MOT tester, shares their guide on what you need to know: WHAT IS A SERVICE? A service is a vehicle inspection based on guidelines set out by your vehicle manufacturer rather than the DVSA that keeps your car in a reliable, safe and fully-functioning condition. In some ways an MOT test and service are quite similar and both include checks on tyres, brakes and seatbelts. However, a service is more thorough and includes the replacement of some parts, primarily the engine oil, to maintain the smooth running of your car. WHAT IS AN MOT TEST? An MOT test is an annual inspection of your vehicle that is required by law. It follows a strict checklist of criteria set out by the DVSA that determines if your vehicle is fit for purpose and in roadworthy condition. Your vehicle may require additional work in order to pass your MOT but the test itself does not include any repairs or replacement parts.

According to Kwik Fit, a good general rule of thumb is to take your car for a full service every 12,000 miles or every 12 months, whichever comes sooner.



This can help to keep your car running efficiently and identify potential problems early on, reducing the risk of more serious and costly problems in the future.





Most importantly, regular car servicing is vital in helping to keep you safe on the roads.

With more than 500 service centres across the UK, there is no better place for you to go the next time you need to book in for one.

As part of the service, a highly trained, certified technician will inspect the vehicle to make sure it is in a reliable, safe and fully-functioning condition based on guidelines set out by the vehicle manufacturer. The technician will then recommend specific checks and replacement parts, such as changing of the oil or fuel filter, so you can rest assured your car is as safe as can be.

Kwik Fit provides a range of affordable car service packages to suit a range of needs, whether it is a full service or an Engine Oil or Filter Change, which you can discover here.

The other thing many car owners need to think about is the MOT test, which is designed to ensure that your vehicle meets road safety and environmental standards as set out by the DVSA.

Cars over three years old must by law pass a yearly MOT test to show they are roadworthy. There are some exemptions, including on classic cars first built or registered more than 40 years ago. Cars that are less than three years old do not need to have an MOT test.

Kwik Fit is the UK's No. 1 MOT tester, so you can rest assured that you're getting the best service possible.

TOP TIP: If your service is due at the same time as your annual MOT test, why not save time - and money - by combining the two. Kwik Fit offers a combined service and MOT that allows you to avoid the extra hassle of taking your car to both an MOT and service station, while also saving time because both can be carried out in a single appointment. You can find out more on their website.

HOW DO I MAKE MORNINGS LESS STRESSFUL?

Deep breath: A few simple changes can help things run much smoother at home

Parents everywhere know the stress of a busy house in the hours before school starts but what's the best way to beat the morning rush?

Mummy bloggers, news websites and parenting magazines are all bursting with tips on the steps families can take to make things a little calmer in those precious early hours. Here's our pick of the best:

1. Plan the night before: P.E. kits, homework folders, or a fresh uniform. No matter what it is that your little ones need, make sure you think about it, find it and get it ready the night before. Spending five minutes doing this can save you 20 minutes in the morning.

2. Talk things through: If you're struggling to get your children to keep to a schedule, try engaging with them and talk through what it is that causes stress in the morning so that you can work together to resolve it. This works better with older kids but is also helpful to start little ones thinking about what they can do to help.

3. Ask Mum and Dad: Stuck for practical ways to get things running smoothly? Then why not ask your mum and dad for advice. It might be difficult to remember but they were in your position once and might have tips on how to weather the storm.

4. Give yourself a break: If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, give yourself a time out and take a few minutes to take a deep breath and gather your thoughts before returning to the family. There is no rulebook on parenting so don't beat yourself up if you feel like you're failing.

5. Always keep the car in good condition and ready to drive: A sure-fire way for the day to take a turn for the worse is to get in the car and find it won't start, or be faced with a flashing warning light on the dashboard. Ensure your car is serviced on a regular basis to keep things running smoothly. Scroll up for everything Kwik Fit can do to help or find more information here.

</p><p>California's Bay Area housing stock has all but dried up. Rents and home prices in the area are among the most expensive in the country. The situation has forced an exodus of young families from the area, while the poorest can end up living on the streets.</p><p>On a mission to fix the shortage, <a href="https://abodu.com/">Abodu</a> wants to add permanent housing units in weeks, not years.</p><p>The company manufactures accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, that can be dropped into people's backyards and finished in as little as five days. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/affordable-prefab-tiny-homes-in-san-jose-for-backyard-2020-4">Each unit is identical</a> in its structure, although customers can customize the colors and finishes. That allows the company to order materials in batches and assemble them in a very repeatable way.</p><p>They range in size from studios of 340 square feet to two-bedrooms at 610 square feet.</p>

    </p><h2>A fix for the housing shortage</h2><p>Founded in 2018, the company was bootstrapped with Geary and cofounder Eric McInerney's last bonuses from working as consultants at Bain &amp; Company. But on Tuesday, Abodu revealed it had raised $3.5 million in its first round of venture funding back in March, in order to grow its team to 10 people. The valuation was undisclosed.</p><p>Initialized Capital's Kim-Mai Cutler, a former tech reporter who is well-known for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/">her stories on housing policy</a>, pitched the early-stage venture capital firm on investing in Abodu. The firm put in $3 million of the financing.</p><p>"I've seen a ton of teams in this space over the years. Some had no real construction experience. Others used tech that was unnecessarily complicated for what consumers need," Cutler <a href="https://twitter.com/kimmaicutler/status/1318592745452097536">wrote in a tweet</a>.</p><p>"John and Eric were different. They just do it. They just deliver. They impressed me with the fact that they have been able to consistently deliver new permanent housing units in *weeks* and they do it repeatedly," she <a href="https://twitter.com/kimmaicutler/status/1318592746450382848">added</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>In San Jose, California, the company worked with municipal agencies to create a pre-approval program for residents who wants to install an Abodu home in their backyard. The city awards same-day permits for those projects.</p><p>And elsewhere in the state, Abodu does the work of getting permits over the finish line for customers. The task got a lot easier on January 1, 2020, after California <a href="https://twitter.com/kimmaicutler/status/1318592741924691968">passed legislation</a> that made it easier to add backyard homes.</p><p>Abodu has installed "dozens" of units in the Bay Area over the last 12 months, according to the company.</p>

<h2>There's no place like home</h2><p>Before the pandemic, Geary said most customers were building units to rent and earn a side income. Now, around 80% of orders come from families who want to house a parent or a child back from college in their backyard.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/07/pandemic-young-adults-living-with-parents/613723/">Zillow reports</a> that a record number of young adults have moved back home during the pandemic, whether their college campus closed to help curb coronavirus outbreaks or they lost their job in an ongoing recession.</p><p>"They need a solution fast because every other option looks scary," Geary said.</p>

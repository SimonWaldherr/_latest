The Browns’ impressive season hit a potential hiccup on Thursday.

Odell Beckham Jr. was sent home with an illness, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski told reporters. The star receiver has not tested positive for COVID-19 and the team will get his latest test result on Friday.

“With this day and age, you’ve just got to be so careful in this environment, so just want to make sure we’re being proactive in that regard.” Stefanski said.

Stefanski said the team was already on “high alert” before Beckham’s sickness because of the pandemic.

“With how the protocols are, you have to be careful,” Stefanski said. “So I don’t want to assume anything, but with all of our guys we’ll just make sure we follow the protocols and just be safe.”

Beckham, 27, has 21 catches for 294 yards and three touchdowns this season for the 4-1 Browns, who play the rival Steelers on Sunday.

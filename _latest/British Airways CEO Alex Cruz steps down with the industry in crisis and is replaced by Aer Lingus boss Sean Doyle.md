British Airways CEO Alex Cruz is stepping down and will be replaced by Aer Lingus CEO Sean Doyle.

International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, said the airline industry was facing its worst crisis in history.

Cruz told a government committee in September that the airline was burning through £20 million, or about $26 million, a day and "fighting for its survival."

It plans to cut 13,000 jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The CEO of British Airways, Alex Cruz, has stepped down, the airline's parent company said Monday.

Cruz, who was appointed chairman and chief executive of the flag-carrying airline in 2016, will be replaced by Sean Doyle, the CEO of Aer Lingus, the Dublin-based airline also owned by International Airlines Group.

BA's new CEO worked for British Airways for 20 years in various roles, including as director of network, fleet, and alliances, before becoming Aer Lingus' chief executive in January 2019.

IAG CEO Luis Gallego said British Airways was "navigating the worst crisis faced in our industry."

The airline, which employs 42,000 people, announced plans to cut up to 12,000 jobs in April. This has since been increased to 13,000.

Gallego thanked Cruz for working "tirelessly to modernize the airline," adding that he "has led the airline through a particularly demanding period."

Cruz told a government committee on September 16 that the coronavirus pandemic "has devastated our business, our sector, and we're still fighting for our own survival," adding that the company was burning through £20 million, or about $26 million, a day.

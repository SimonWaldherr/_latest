description: > 
  For weeks during lockdown I was in love with a Ports 1961 handbag sample that followed me around wherever I went.Where I went, of course, was to the boundaries and back of a tiny world.Kitchen, sitting room... no journey was too short for me not to slide my hand through its pleasingly symmetrical twin handles, grip and carry.Even before a virus changed so much, bags exerted an emotional pull on us that went way beyond their function.Each expertly tooled, painstakingly compartmented artefact, with its soft-as-lemon-curd leather, came with the promise of a perfectly organised life.

Northern leaders were in open revolt over the Government’s plans to impose tougher Tier 3 restrictions on Greater Manchester last night.

Regional Mayor Andy Burnham warned the North’s jobs and businesses must not be a “sacrificial lamb” so ministers could try to save them elsewhere.

The furious Labour politician argued it would cost less in the longterm to support local businesses now rather than let them go to the wall.

Almost half the population of England, 27m people, will now be under stricter lockdown measures from Saturday as London was escalated to the second tier of measures.

Essex, Elmbridge, Barrow and Furness, York, NE Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield will also face a ban on households mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants.

The move could put 1.5m jobs at risk in more than 5,000 pubs and almost 8,500 restaurants as they struggle to survive the restrictions without Government support.

Yet the Government’s top scientific advisors have warned that the new measures will not go far enough in getting to grips with the virus.

Another 18,980 more coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK yesterday, with English hospital admissions up 15% in a day.

There were 138 further deaths, almost double the number a week ago.

Merseyside, home to 1.6m people, became the first part of the UK to enter Tier 3 this week but plans for parts of Lancashire to follow were put on hold.

Boris Johnson is under continued pressure to impose a short, nationwide circuit-breaker lockdown to try to bring down case numbers.

It could buy time to fix the Test and Trace system which has recorded its worst ever week for contact tracing with just 62.6% of close contacts reached.

The system needs to contact 80% to be effective.

Greater Manchester leaders were locked in a bitter row with Government over plans for harsher restrictions but without the necessary financial support.

Talks with No 10 ended in fury as ministers refused to up their offer to workers and businesses across the region.

The Prime Minister plans to press on with putting Greater Manchester under the toughest restrictions without the consent of local politicians - including his own Tory MPs.

But it raises fears that people will simply refuse to follow the rules.

Standing on the steps of Manchester Central Library, Mr Burnham told the crowds: “It may be that we need to look at a national circuit-break as preferable to this unfunded, risky regional lockdown strategy.

“We have to protect the health of the nation but let’s do it as one nation, and not make the North of England the sacrificial lamb for an ill-thought-through Downing Street policy which doesn’t make sense in the real world.”

The Mayor accused the Government of treating the North with contempt, adding: “People are fed up of being treated in this way, the North is fed up of being pushed around.

“We aren’t going to be pushed around any more.”

Mr Burnham called for 80% furlough for all affected workers, 80% income support for the self-employed, and a proper compensation scheme for businesses if the Prime Minister presses ahead with the regional lockdown.

The Job Support Scheme, which launches on November 1 and lasts for six months, will involve the Government paying two-thirds of each employee’s salary.

“Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are being set up as the canaries in the coalmine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy as an attempt to prevent the expense of what is truly needed,” he said.

He also revealed that deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam had told them that the only thing “certain” to drive down infections was a full national lockdown.

“But the Government told us this morning it is unwilling to do that because of the damage it will do to the national economy.

“And yet that is what they want to impose on the North West.

“So that was our conclusion from the Number 10 meeting this morning: they are willing to try and sacrifice jobs and businesses here to try and save them elsewhere.”

Mr Burnham has already threatened legal action if the Government imposes further lockdown on the region.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wanted to see “rapid progress” on the lockdown as the situation in the North West of England was severe.

He said: “The number of cases is rising exponentially, the number of people in hospital with Covid has doubled in just the last 12 days.”

Mr Hancock accused Mr Burnham of playing “party politics” even though Greater Manchester agreed to restrictions first imposed in July.

And every single Tory MP in Greater Manchester also opposed the plans.

William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove said: “I have news from Greater Manchester where the impossible has been achieved.

“All of the Members of Parliament, the leaders of the councils and indeed the mayor, surprisingly, are in agreement with one another, the meeting we had earlier today was entirely pointless.

“I may as well have talked to a wall, quite frankly.”

Sir Graham Brady, Tory MP for Altrincham and Sale West, told Times Radio: “The danger is that if you try to do these things without consent, people lose patience very quickly.

“We have a very clear demonstration at the moment that if you have no support amongst MPs, no support from the council leaders, and opposition from the Mayor as well, there clearly isn’t the broad consent for this measure that would be needed.

“I think it would be a very foolish thing to do.”

London Mayor Sadiq Khan told City Hall the move to Tier 2 was based on expert public health and scientific advice and would save lives.

“It is clear that the virus is now spreading rapidly in every part of our city, and hospital and ICU admissions are steadily rising,” he said.

“Time and again it has been shown that it is better to act earlier than to act too late – which would cost more lives and damage more livelihoods.

“I am not willing to put Londoners’ lives at risk and we must do all we can to minimise economic damage.”

Mr Khan said he would push ministers for more financial support as the ban on households mixing could be devastating for the capital’s 3,640 pubs and 7,556 restaurants.

They will see business suffer but not be eligible for Government support available to premises which have been ordered to close.

He added: “There are no good options. I know these further restrictions will require Londoners to make yet more sacrifices, but the disastrous failure of the test, trace and isolate system leaves us with little choice.”

Tier 2 measures mean people aren’t allowed to meet anybody from another household or support bubble indoors, including at home or in pubs and restaurants.

The Rule of Six continues to apply outdoors, including in private gardens.

Schools will remain open in all circumstances and people will be advised to work from home and minimise journeys, although they are not banned.

All shops, including hairdressers and beauticians, will stay open as well as gyms and leisure centres.

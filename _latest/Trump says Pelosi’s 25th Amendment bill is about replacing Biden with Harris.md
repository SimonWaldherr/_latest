WASHINGTON — President Trump speculated on Friday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s new 25th Amendment commission was not about him but Democratic opponent Joe Biden.

“Crazy Nancy Pelosi is looking at the 25th Amendment in order to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris,” he told his 87 million followers on Twitter.

“The Dems want that to happen fast because Sleepy Joe is out of it!!!” he went on.

Pelosi (D. Calif) earlier Friday unveiled legislation which seeks to effectively strip “future presidents” of presidential powers if they are unable to fulfill their duties through a bipartisan committee.

The “Commission on Presidential Capacity to Discharge the Powers and Duties of Office Act” is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate and has raised eyebrows with its introduction just 25 days until Election Day.

“This is not about President Trump,” the speaker insisted at a Friday morning press conference.

“He will face the judgement on the voters, but he shows the need for us to create a process for future presidents,” she went on, referring to his diagnosis with COVID-19.

Pelosi has questioned Trump’s mental and physical fitness following his coronavirus diagnosis last week, claiming that he’s “in an altered state right now” and saying the steroid dexamethasone he received may impede his judgment.

Reporters mentioned this to Pelosi at her briefing and said the American people could be skeptical of her motives given the fact Congress had already moved to impeach Trump.

The speaker, 80, said the decision would be made with the full involvement of the vice president “whoever she or he may be at the time” — an apparent nod to Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris.

Trump returned fire earlier Thursday, tweeting, “Crazy Nancy is the one who should be under observation. They don’t call her Crazy for nothing!”

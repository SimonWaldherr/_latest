UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya is grateful to be lauded by one of the greatest fighters of all time.

After Adesanya (20-0 MMA, 9-0 UFC) put on a masterclass against Paulo Costa last month at UFC 253, former two-division champion Georges St-Pierre hailed him as the “perfect fighter.”

Adesanya, who looked up to former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva growing up, also has an immense amount of respect for the legendary GSP.

“GOATs recognize GOATs,” Adesanya told MMA Junkie. “Bless you, Monsieur St-Pierre. Merci beaucoup. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. That’s a beautiful compliment coming from a GOAT, because GOATs recognize GOATS. Honestly, it’s beautiful hearing that from him, from a guy who I’ve watched for years and I was a fan of.

“Don’t get me wrong, Silva was my guy. Artistry, this is martial arts. St-Pierre held himself to a certain code like no other, same as Anderson. But yeah, it’s beautiful. It’s cool that someone like that can be – not that I needed it, but it’s nice. It feels good to be recognized by a great like that, so salut monsieur, St-Pierre.”

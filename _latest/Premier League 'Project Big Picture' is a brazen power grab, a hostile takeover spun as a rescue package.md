First the good news: yes, to the redistribution of money, the additional cash proposed for ‘good causes’ including the Football Association, the bail-out for the EFL, the finance for stadium improvements, the women’s professional league independent of the Premier League and the FA, and a fan charter. They are fantastic proposals. Go for them all now.

It is hard to disagree with the argument that the current funding model is not working although the irony will not be lost on many people in football that Parry was the first chief executive of the Premier League who oversaw the disproportionate distribution of wealth in the first place. The Premier League has been a good thing; it has been an incredible, resounding success; one of the UK’s greatest exports. It needs to re-examine how the wealth is distributed. But not at the cost being demanded.

As for other ideas: the toss can be argued over changing the mechanism for promotion and relegation, even reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and at the price of losing two from the EFL. We can debate scrapping the League Cup and the Community Shield although surely not to simply allow the ‘Big Six’ to embark on longer and more lucrative pre-season tours.

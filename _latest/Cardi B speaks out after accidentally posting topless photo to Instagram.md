It’s a question we find ourselves asking more and more lately.

Cardi B addressed the accidental nude pic that surfaced on her Instagram Story Tuesday, uploading a voice message to Twitter that “read,” “Lord why the f–k you have to make me so f—ing stupid and retarded? Why? Why? Why? Why?”

“I’m going to eat my breakfast, and then I’m going to go to a party because I’m not even going to think about it,” the 28-year-old rapper added. “I am not going to think about it, ok? Nope, no I’m not. I’m not.

“It is what it is. S–t happens. F–k it, it’s not even the first time. I mean, I used to f—ing be a stripper so whatever. Ay, Dios mío.”

Perhaps Cardi could also find solace in the parade of luxury goods gifted to her for her birthday this week, including a $300,000 Rolls-Royce truck — with $8,000 custom car seat for her daughter with estranged husband Offset, Kulture — and two Birkin bags, one of which rang up at $38,450.

Or she could just take note of the fact that when it comes to accidentally posting one’s own nude snaps, she’s in pretty good company.

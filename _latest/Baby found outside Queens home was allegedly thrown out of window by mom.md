Police on scene where a newborn baby was tossed out a window in Queens

Sabita Dookram is arrested after allegedly giving birth at home and tossing the newborn boy out the window.

The newborn baby found outside a Queens home Sunday was allegedly thrown out a bathroom window by his mother, who’d just given birth, police sources said.

The baby boy, who also suffered hypothermia, is likely to die of his injuries, sources said Monday.

He was discovered with his umbilical cord still attached outside a home on 126th Street in South Ozone Park around 10:15 a.m. Sunday and taken to Cohen Children’s Medical Center.

Investigators determined that the infant’s 23-year-old mother had just given birth in the bathtub, then tossed the baby out the bathroom window, sources said.

She is undergoing an evaluation at Jamaica Hospital, pending criminal charges, sources added.

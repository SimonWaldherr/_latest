<p>Bethenny Frankel slammed the &#8220;Dancing with the Stars&#8221; host <a href="https://okmagazine.com/exclusives/tyra-banks-bans-real-housewives-dwts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after a report from OK! Magazine</a> claimed that Banks, 46, &#8220;made it clear that she didn&#8217;t want any more &#8216;Housewives&#8217; in her ballroom&#8230; Tyra has never been a fan of the &#8216;Housewives,&#8217; but the real reason she doesn&#8217;t want them on her show is that Bethenny Frankel, NeNe Leakes and Teresa Giudice do not make headlines anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a tweet that was quickly deleted, Frankel, 49, wrote, &#8220;Good to know @tyrabanks has clumped me in her no more housewives mandate on @DancingABC. Also good to know-their casting director Deena, who I &#10084;&#65039; has asked me to be on that show multiple x in the last decade. I&#8217;m also no longer a housewife, but nobody is bigger than the game Tyra.&#8221;</p>

<p>She later clarified why she deleted her comment by<a href="https://twitter.com/Bethenny/status/1319319746878279681" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> tweeting,</a>&#160;&#8220;I deleted that last post Bc I really like &amp; have a great relationship with Deena Katz from #DWTS. If @tyrabanks wants to come on my podcast, she is welcome anytime as she has built a successful brand on her own in her own way. #justbwithbethenny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frankel isn&#8217;t the only one giving Banks flack during her <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/15/tyra-banks-named-as-new-dancing-with-the-stars-host/?_ga=2.34318501.54476145.1603058038-1818765841.1599498558">first season hosting the dance competition series</a> as Banks flubbed an elimination earlier this month, leading to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/06/tyra-banks-at-the-center-of-dancing-with-the-stars-mix-up/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fan criticism</a> on social media.</p>
<p>While the Skinnygirl mogul won&#8217;t be appearing on the show any time soon, &#8220;RHOBH&#8221; stars Lisa Rinna, Erika Girardi and Lisa Vanderpump appeared on different seasons of the ABC show.</p>
<p>&#8220;RHOA&#8221; stars NeNe Leakes, Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Kim Fields also competed for a mirrorball trophy.</p>
<p>Ironically, &#8220;RHOA&#8221; star Eva Marcille got her start on Banks&#8217; now-defunct &#8220;America&#8217;s Next Top Model.&#8221;</p>

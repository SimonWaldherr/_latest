  Questor: it's taking on Covid and fighting cancer, but Roche is far from overvalued. Buy 
description: > 
  If Britain really is to test 10m people a day for coronavirus, as Boris Johnson wants as part of his “Moonshot” plan to restore some kind of normality, it will probably need the services of the company we feature this week.Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant, has a large diagnostics business and is the biggest supplier of Covid-19 tests to the NHS.Although its tests are not the rapid ones for at-home use that will be needed to deliver the huge daily numbers the Prime Minister has in mind, Roche’s more accurate laboratory-based variety will be essential for weeding out “false positives” among the quicker tests.“In a pandemic you need quick, cheap-and-cheerful tests that you can make in bulk but are not completely reliable and then you recheck anyone who comes back positive with a top-quality test,” said Simon Edelsten, who holds Roche in his Mid Wynd investment trust.“Otherwise you risk having as many false positives as real ones.”

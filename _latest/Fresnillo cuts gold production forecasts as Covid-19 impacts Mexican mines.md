  Fresnillo cuts gold production forecasts as Covid-19 impacts Mexican mines 
description: > 
  Anglo-Mexican mining firm Fresnillo has said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its mines in Mexico has forced it to cut gold production guidance again this year.Chief executive Octavio AlvÃ­drez said the firm had experienced 'some impact as a result of the additional working restrictions in place at the open-pit mines and this has affected our gold production.'The group's full-year silver production guidance also remains unchanged at 51 million to 56 million ounces 'despite the disruption of this pandemic,' remarked Alvidrez, which has led to massive cuts in output at its Fresnillo plant.In the last six months, only B&Q owner Kingfisher' share price has outperformed it among FTSE 100 companies.Its shares plummeted by a fifth this morning after it revealed that it had slashed its gold production guidance both for this year and next.

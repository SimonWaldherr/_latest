Boris Johnson faced a significant revolt over his coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday night, as 42 Tory MPs voted against a controversial curfew on pubs, and a member of the Government resigned over local lockdowns.

In a warning shot to the Prime Minister, backbenchers rebelled against a package of retrospective measures which included the controversial 10pm closing time for hospitality, as well as other restrictions on public spaces and fines.

However, the Government's new three-tier approach to local lockdown was waved through the Commons despite increasing anger amongst Tory MPs.

The chair of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, said that Boris Johnson was in danger of creating a "half alive state" with the new lockdown system that will come into force in England on Wednesday.

The new lockdown rules divide local authorities into three tiers listed as medium, high, and very high, with the highest level of restriction banning almost all social mixing between households.

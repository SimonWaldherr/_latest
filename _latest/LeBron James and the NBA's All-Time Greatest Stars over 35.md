This was his age-36 campaign, and he was still a walking double-double (17.8 points and 9.9 rebounds) and 50-plus-percent finisher (50.2 field-goal percentage, to be precise).</p><p class="">His place on San Antonio's pecking order was fuzzy at times as these Spurs ran first through Tony Parker and eventually cleared room for Kawhi Leonard's emergence. But Duncan, an All-NBA first-team selection and All-Defensive second-teamer, played a prominent role in a season that featured 58 Spurs wins and a seven-game loss to the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.</p><p class="">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Alex English, 1988-89 Denver Nuggets</strong></p><p class="">There was no such thing as playing too fast on Doug Moe's Nuggets teams of the 1980s, so the production could run a little inflated. <a href="https://stathead.com/basketball/tsl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=pts_per_g&amp;type=team_totals&amp;lg_id=NBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three</a> of the six highest-scoring seasons in NBA history were overseen by Moe in Denver.</p><p class="">That partly explains why English gets only an honorable mention despite authoring the highest points-per-game mark of any 35-plus hooper (<a href="https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=pts_per_g&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=21&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pts_per_g&amp;positions%5B%5D=G&amp;positions%5B%5D=GF&amp;positions%5B%5D=F&amp;positions%5B%5D=FG&amp;positions%5B%5D=FC&amp;positions%5B%5D=C&amp;positions%5B%5D=CF&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;age_min=35&amp;age_max=99&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;college_id=0&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">26.5</a>).

But he did book a starting spot in the All-Star Game and posted a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html#all_advanced" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20.7</a> player efficiency rating.</p><p class="">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Steve Nash, 2009-10 Phoenix Suns</strong></p><p class="">Before back injuries got the better of him, Nash was teaching wine about effective aging.

He dropped an NBA-best 11.0 dimes per contest. He toyed with defenders to the tune of a 50.7/42.6/93.8 shooting slash. He quarterbacked one of the <a href="https://stathead.com/basketball/tsl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=off_rtg&amp;type=team_totals&amp;lg_id=NBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 best offenses</a> in NBA history and steered the Suns to the conference finals.

Saying that, it's still worth marveling at his age-35 season. He not only totaled a top-20 scoring average (21.7, 13th), but he was also a few fortunate bounces away from compiling the 50/40/90 slash line that defines efficient shooting (he "settled" for 49.7/39.8/89.9).</p><p class="">He didn't touch many other areas on the stat sheet, and whatever defensive resistance he once offered had largely eroded.

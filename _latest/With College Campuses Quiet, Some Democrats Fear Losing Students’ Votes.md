<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Ms. Slotkin doesn&#8217;t have a whole lot of room to spare. In 2018, she won handily in Ingham County, home to Michigan State and to thousands of state employees who work in nearby Lansing, the capital. But she lost in Livingston County, and in the suburban Detroit portion of the district in Oakland County. If her numbers fall in Ingham County, the race may swing back to a Republican this year.</p><p class="notification-copy">

    <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Though young Americans typically vote at lower rates than the electorate does as a whole, the race in Michigan&#8217;s Eighth District isn&#8217;t the only one where their absence could have an impact. David Wasserman, the House editor at the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://cookpolitical.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cook Political Report</a>, cited Illinois&#8217;s 13th Congressional District, where Betsy Dirksen Londrigan, a Democrat, is again challenging Representative Rodney Davis, who narrowly beat her <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/illinois-house-district-13" title="">in 2018</a>.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Democrats were hoping a big turnout would increase Ms. Londrigan&#8217;s chances in the rematch, especially with the college vote at the campuses of the University of Illinois, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and Illinois State University. But remote classes have left many students living away from campus, and the Cook Political Report has rated the race as leaning toward Mr. Davis&#8217;s re-election.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;The Democratic theory of that race was that all they needed to do was get the turnout up,&#8221; Mr. Wasserman said. &#8220;But there are a lot of moving parts to this student migration situation.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Nathan L. Gonzales, editor of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://insideelections.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inside Elections</a> newsletter, said the loss of students at the campuses of Oregon State University and the University of Oregon could be a factor in the race for Oregon&#8217;s Fourth Congressional District, home to both schools.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat seeking an 18th term, is facing a well-funded Republican challenger, Alek Skarlatos, a former Oregon National Guard specialist who gained fame in 2015 when <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/world/europe/3-heroes-who-stopped-train-attack-were-boyhood-friends.html" title="">he helped foil a terrorist attack</a> on a train bound for Paris. Inside Elections still gives the edge to Mr. DeFazio, but the newsletter has shifted its rating of the race from &#8220;Solid Democratic&#8221; to &#8220;Likely Democratic.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;In close races, everyone and everything matters,&#8221; Mr. Gonzales said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s hard to identify one single factor that makes the difference. But the lack of college students on campus should be a concern for some Democratic candidates.&#8221;</p></div>

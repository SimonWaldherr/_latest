<div><p>Jeffrey Toobin shares something else in common with Anthony Weiner besides allegedly not being able <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/jeffrey-toobin-was-masturbating-in-front-of-new-yorker-bigs-report/">to keep it in his pants</a> &#8212; <a href="https://pagesix.com/2014/01/08/anthony-weiner-to-make-cameo-in-alpha-house/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a filmed cameo</a> appearance together for an Amazon show.</p>
<p>The New Yorker staff writer, suspended for allegedly masturbating during a Zoom work call last week, and Weiner, who resigned from Congress amid an X-rated sexting scandal in 2011, both popped up in a scene taped for the finale of the political comedy &#8220;Alpha House&#8217;&#8217; in 2014.</p>
<p>Weiner was playing himself in the scene for the series, which was written by &#8220;Doonesbury&#8217;&#8217; comic-strip creator Garry Trudeau and lasted two seasons.</p>
<p>A photo from the taping shows a grim-faced Weiner leaning into the camera while Toobin is turned to the side.</p>
<p>Toobin &#8212; a prolific 60-year-old author, Harvard Law School grad and CNN&#8217;s top legal analyst &#8212; was accused Monday of masturbating during an online video meeting with fellow New Yorker stars, as well as workers from WNYC public radio.</p>
<p>He later admitted <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdgm4/new-yorker-suspends-jeffrey-toobin-for-zoom-dick-incident" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to the Web site Vice</a> that he had &#8220;made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>The New Yorker suspended him, while CNN said he is now on a leave of absence from the network.</p>
 
<p>Meanwhile, Weiner of Queens is now the CEO of <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/14/disgraced-pol-anthony-weiner-is-ceo-at-a-broken-glass-factory/">a company that makes countertops</a> out of broken glass.</p>
<p>The disgraced ex-pol, who did hard time for sexting with a 15-year-old girl, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/anthony-weiner-admits-his-political-aspirations-have-shriveled/">said in a TV interview</a> that aired Monday that his political life is virtually over.</p>

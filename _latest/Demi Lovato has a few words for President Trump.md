(CNN) Demi Lovato wants to use her voice for more than just singing.

That's why her new song, "Commander in Chief," is directed toward President Donald Trump, calling out his response to racial injustice, the Covid-19 crisis and more.

Lovato, 28, spoke to CNN in a recent interview about the song and its message.

"There's been so many times that I've wanted to write the President a letter or sit down with him and ask him these questions," she told CNN. "And then I thought, I don't really actually want to do that and I thought one way that I could do that is writing a song and releasing it for the whole world to hear and then he has to answer those questions to everyone and not just me."

In the song, which Lovato co-wrote, she sings "Do you even know the truth/We're in a state of crisis/People are dying/While you line your pockets deep/Commander in Chief/How does it feel/To still be able to breathe?"

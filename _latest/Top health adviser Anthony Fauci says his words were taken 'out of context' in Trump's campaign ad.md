  Top health adviser Anthony Fauci says his words were taken 'out of context' in Trump's campaign ad 
description: > 
  Top government scientist Anthony Fauci said on Sunday that an ad aired by Donald Trump's reelection campaign was edited to make him seem to endorse the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic."In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate," Dr Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement.The 30-second campaign ad cites Mr Trump's personal experience with the virus - "President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus, and so is America", it says - before including a brief clip in which Dr Fauci appears to praise the president's response to the pandemic."I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more," Dr Fauci is shown as saying, creating the clear impression he is referring to Mr Trump.So, I can't imagine that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more."

Top government scientist Anthony Fauci said on Sunday that an ad aired by Donald Trump's reelection campaign was edited to make him seem to endorse the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

"In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate," Dr Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement.

The 30-second campaign ad cites Mr Trump's personal experience with the virus - "President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus, and so is America", it says - before including a brief clip in which Dr Fauci appears to praise the president's response to the pandemic.

"I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more," Dr Fauci is shown as saying, creating the clear impression he is referring to Mr Trump.

But a complete clip of Dr Fauci's comments, made during an interview in March with Fox News, shows the doctor saying: "I have been devoting almost full time on this. I'm down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. It's every single day. So, I can't imagine that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more."

<div><p>Top club Santos signed a contract &#8211; now suspended &#8211; with the former Brazil striker who was convicted of rape in Italy in 2017</p><p>A public debate over sexual violence and rape culture has erupted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil" class="u-underline">Brazil</a> after one of its leading football clubs tried to recruit a convicted rapist to lead its attack.</p>
<p>Santos Futebol Clube &#8211; which has produced sporting legends including Pel&#233; and Neymar &#8211; <a href="https://globoesporte.globo.com/sp/santos-e-regiao/futebol/times/santos/noticia/santos-anuncia-a-volta-de-robinho.ghtml" class="u-underline">announced</a> the highly controversial signing of the former Manchester City striker Robinho on 10 October.</p>
<p>The decision to bring the 36-year-old back to the club where he began his top-flight career was taken despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/23/robinho-nine-years-prison-rape-milan-court-manchester-city" class="u-underline">his being found guilty in 2017</a> of involvement in a gang rape that took place in Italy in 2013. Robinho, who is appealing against the conviction, was given a nine-year sentence in absentia which was suspended until the appeals process is complete.</p>
<p>Amid a wave of public anger, Santos&#8217;s president, Orlando Rollo, <a href="https://globoesporte.globo.com/sp/santos-e-regiao/futebol/times/santos/noticia/noticias-santos-entrevista-rollo-robinho-pedido-copia-processo-italia.ghtml" class="u-underline">defended Robinho</a>, claiming he was the victim of an inhumane &#8220;moral stoning&#8221;. &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s judging Robinho but nobody has even read the sentence.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Rollo spoke, however, a Brazilian journalist in Milan was busy unearthing the 2017 ruling by an Italian judge over the nightclub assault, details of which had not previously been published.</p>
<p>The judgment included transcripts considered by the court of a series of shocking exchanges captured by police investigators who were monitoring Robinho&#8217;s phone and car.</p>

<p>When excerpts of those intercepted messages <a href="https://globoesporte.globo.com/sp/santos-e-regiao/futebol/times/santos/noticia/as-gravacoes-do-caso-robinho-na-justica-italiana-a-mulher-estava-completamente-bebada.ghtml" class="u-underline">were published by the Globo Esporte website</a> on Friday morning they painted a damning picture of Robinho&#8217;s behaviour.</p>
<p>In one message to a friend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/robinho" class="u-underline">Robinho</a> refers to the assault, which took place in January 2013, saying: &#8220;I&#8217;m laughing because I couldn&#8217;t care less, the woman was completely drunk, she has no idea what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another chat Robinho, who played for AC Milan at the time, insisted he did not have sex with the victim, an Albanian woman then in her early 20s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you when you put your penis inside her mouth,&#8221; his friend replied, to which the footballer responded: &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean having sex.&#8221;</p>
<p>The messages caused further outrage in Brazil and apparently made Robinho&#8217;s return to Santos unsustainable after sponsors rebelled.</p>
<p>Later on Friday the striker announced his contract&#8217;s suspension and <a href="https://twitter.com/folha/status/1317221620902146048?s=20" class="u-underline">claimed</a> he was being persecuted by the &#8220;demonic&#8221; press like Brazil&#8217;s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at what they did to Bolsonaro &#8230; saying Bolsonaro was this and that, that he was a racist, a fascist, a killer &#8211; and the more they went for Bolsonaro the more popular he became,&#8221; Robinho said.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Brazilian outlet UOL he insisted he was &#8220;totally innocent&#8221; and suggested some of the messages had been mistranslated or taken out of context.</p>
<p>Robinho, who claims his &#8220;contact&#8221; was consensual, also blamed feminists for his predicament, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1sFM_qnpmQ" class="u-underline">telling an interviewer</a>: &#8220;Unfortunately there&#8217;s this feminist movement &#8230; lots of women who aren&#8217;t even women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indignation over Robinho&#8217;s actions &#8211; and what many saw as Santos&#8217;s attempts to downplay his crime &#8211; came as new figures underlined the scale of Brazil&#8217;s sexual violence crisis.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Forum on Public Security <a href="https://extra.globo.com/noticias/brasil/brasil-registrou-um-estupro-cada-8-minutos-em-2019-24700754.html" class="u-underline">said</a> 66,123 rapes were reported last year &#8211; one every eight minutes. Nearly 86% of victims were female and 60% under-14.</p>
<p>Ana Paula Ara&#250;jo, the author of a new book called <a href="https://www.uol.com.br/universa/noticias/redacao/2020/10/14/ana-paula-araujo-livro.htm" class="u-underline">Abuse: Rape culture in Brazil</a>, said those shocking figures were only the tip of the iceberg because 90% of crimes went unreported.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a veritable plague and a silent one because quite often women normalize this [abuse], as do men. Society thinks this is the way things are &#8230; That sexual abuse often isn&#8217;t all that serious. And that&#8217;s why we continue to live in this culture which allows all these different kinds of abuses to be practised against us all, every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ara&#250;jo, a television journalist, called Santos&#8217;s decision to hire Robinho &#8220;disgusting&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;What struck me most about this case was the complete lack of shame this big Brazilian club &#8230; showed in signing a man who has been convicted of rape. He&#8217;s not only been charged. He&#8217;s already been convicted &#8211; and his signing was celebrated with pomp and circumstance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ara&#250;jo said Robinho&#8217;s intercepted messages captured perfectly the need to speak out against the &#8220;poisonous&#8221; culture of rape. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t see himself as a criminal &#8211; and this is a very common mindset here in Brazil.&#8221;</p>

Fake websites that look like official voting resources but contain false or misleading information are being set up to confuse voters ahead of the 2020 election.

The FBI said in a warning issed last week that voters should be on the lookout for fake sites. While the FBI didn't disclose specific fake websites, cybersecurity researchers have identified examples of the scam in action.

Fake websites and emails are being set up by "foreign actors," the FBI said, but it did not specify who is behind the misinformation.

Tech companies like Facebook and Google have pledged to weed out content that misleads people about voting, but some sites could be slipping through the cracks.

Cybercriminals are setting up fake voting websites to spread misinformation and confuse people ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election, the FBI announced last week. While the FBI didn't disclose specific fake websites, cybersecurity researchers have identified examples of the scam in action.

Some fake sites aim to mislead voters to influence the election, while others try to use interest around voting to steal people's passwords. They imitate official election sites but use slightly altered spellings, like changing one letter in the word "election" to trick people into trusting them.

Other versions of the scam use similar tactics to send people emails from spoofed addresses that appear to come from election officials, baiting them with emails that purport to contain information about voting in order to get people to click on malicious links.

Fake websites are run by scammers and "foreign actors," according to the FBI's announcement, but the agency did not specify which entities may be behind the sites.

In one scam identified by cybersecurity firm Zix, criminals are using email listserv tools to send thousands of people emails posing as voting officials that encourage recipients to register to vote. From there, victims are linked to a website designed to look like a voter registration form that tricks them into disclosing personal information.

The tactics are an example of phishing scams in which hackers pose as trusted sources to get people to hand over their information. People lost more than $57.8 million in 2019 as the result of phishing, according to the FBI, with over 114,000 victims targeted in the US.

To avoid falling victim to scams, the FBI recommends that people double-check the source of voting information with the Election Assistance Commission and avoid downloading documents sent from unfamiliar email addresses.

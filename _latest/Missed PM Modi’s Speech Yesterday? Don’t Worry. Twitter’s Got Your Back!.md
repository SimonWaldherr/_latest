<div><p>So, the Coronavirus pandemic is still on. Just in case, you had forgotten it amidst all the pandemic fatigue (look it up). And seems like PM Narendra Modi wanted to do the same so he decided to meet us all at 6 PM yesterday to tell us his <i>mann ki baat</i>. Yes, one would benefit and get more answers to questions in a press conference about things in the national building wheel that has been struck by a stick but hey, you make peace with what you get. Unless you are part of the creative conglomerate on Twitter, I guess. Yeah, there have been some developments on that front and it is a gold mine of memes out there.</p>

<p>If you have missed the PM&#8217;s last address, he spoke about the lapses in abiding by social distancing norms and urged the people to refrain from doing so. He also advocated for the good old mask and said, &#8220;Recently, we saw many photos &amp; videos where it is clearly seen that people are not careful anymore. This isn't right. If you step out without mask, you put your families at risk. We must remember - whether it is America or Europe, cases declined &amp; then there was sudden spike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Needless to say, it was short and brief (and nothing we don&#8217;t know already). So, Twitter did what it does (broke his message down in form of hilarious memes). See them for yourself!</p>

Max relate to the last one on personal level. I mean, if memes won&#8217;t do the talking then what will, really? Also, listen to PM Narendra Modi and wear that Goddamn mask!

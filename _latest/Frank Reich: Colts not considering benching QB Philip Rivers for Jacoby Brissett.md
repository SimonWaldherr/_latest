INDIANAPOLIS — The Indianapolis Colts are not considering a change at quarterback, coach Frank Reich said Monday.

"Philip (Rivers) is our quarterback," Reich said when asked about the possibility of turning to last year's starter, Jacoby Brissett.

The 38-year-old Rivers has come under fire after his ugly, mistake-laden game in Cleveland played a prominent role in the Colts' 32-23 defeat. The 17-year veteran tossed a pair of head-scratching interceptions — one returned for a touchdown by defensive back Ronnie Harrison — and took a safety when he was flagged for an intentional grounding penalty in the end zone.

The pick-6 and the safety were responsible for the nine-point difference in Indy's defeat. Rivers' second interception came early in the fourth quarter when the Colts were trying to mount a late comeback.

While Reich admitted Monday that everyone in the Colts locker room, including Rivers, needs to play better, he assured that he has not lot any faith in his starting quarterback.

"My trust at the end of the day is who he is," Reich said. "This guy is a hall of fame QB. I have the utmost confidence and belief in him, Our team has the utmost confidence and belief in him. You've got to live with some mistakes but the good is going to far outweigh the one or two bad things that are going to happen."

For Rivers, Sunday was the second ugly game in his short five-game stint with the Colts so far. The first came on the NFL's kickoff weekend when he threw another pair of back-breaking interceptions in the Colts' 27-20 defeat to the now 1-4 Jacksonville Jaguars.

The unfortunate commonality in those games for Rivers is that the Colts asked him to put the offense on his shoulders and deliver a victory. Against Jacksonville, Rivers threw it 46 times, and while he racked up 363 yards with a 78.3% completion rate, his interception with less than two minutes to go sealed the game for the Jaguars.

Sunday was far worse for Rivers, who led the Colts offense to just 13 points against a banged up and statistically woeful Browns secondary. When the Colts needed him most — after the defense rallied in the second half, intercepting Baker Mayfield twice and holding the Browns to just three points — Rivers buckled.

Sunday's brutal performance was the latest in an alarming season of struggle for the Colts offense as a whole, which will rank in the bottom half of the league in yards per game, yards per play, total points and red zone offense once Week 5 is over.

According to Football Outsiders, the Colts currently sit 25th in DVOA on offense, but first on defense and second on special teams. There's little question which unit is holding this team back from enjoying bigger success.

Still, while Rivers has struggled in some games, his successes shouldn't be overlooked. He has led the Colts to three wins and many of his overall numbers are solid if not spectacular. He's completing 70.8% of his passes, which would qualify for the highest mark of his career. He's also averaging 8.0 yards per attempt and is being sacked on just 2.5% of his dropbacks.

Before Sunday, advanced metrics saw Rivers as an above-average contributor this season. Football Outsiders' DYAR statistic, which measures the value of the quarterback's performance compared to replacement level (adjusted for situation and opponent) had Rivers ranked 13th.

He'll surely plummet down the rankings after Sunday, but one ugly game isn't enough for him to lose his job. Especially because there's no clear case for Brissett being able to outplay him.

Beyond doing an exemplary job of protecting the football — Brissett threw just six interceptions last season — the Colts' passing game was one of the worst in the NFL. They finished 30th in that department last season, while in the back stretch of the season, Brissett completed an abysmal 56.4% of his passes for just 1,293 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions. He finished the season ranked 26th in completion percentage (.609) and 30th in one of Reich’s top measuring sticks, yards per attempt (6.6).

While the Colts value Brissett — he has a cap hit worth more than $21 million — they still see him, at least for now, as inferior to Rivers.

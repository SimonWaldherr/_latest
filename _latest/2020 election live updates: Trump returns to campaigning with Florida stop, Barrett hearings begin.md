The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold its first confirmation hearing for Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Monday after President Donald Trump nominated her to the Supreme Court in September.

Barrett's nomination has already sparked controversy and partisan rancor as Democrats argue that because Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died so close to the election, Trump and Senate Republicans should wait for the winner of that electoral contest to nominate the person to fill her seat.

In her prepared opening statement for the hearing, a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY, Barrett pays tribute to Ginsburg, saying "no one will ever take her place" and that she "will be forever grateful for the path she marked and the life she led."

Barrett also discusses her judicial philosophy, which is that the courts "are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong," and "policy decisions and value judgments" should be made by elected officials.

Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have expressed concerns about potential coronavirus spread at the hearing after multiple Republican senators tested positive for COVID-19. Sens. Kamala Harris and Patrick Leahy plan to join the hearings remotely. Sens. Thom Tillis and Mike Lee, who were among GOP senators who tested positive, have vowed to attend, either virtually or in-person.

Senate confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett to begin

The Senate will start confirmation hearings Monday for President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett as Republicans aim to confirm her before Election Day.

Monday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is the first of four days of confirmation hearings. All 22 senators on the panel will give opening 10-minute statements, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Barrett will be introduced by Indiana's two Republican senators Todd Young and Mike Braun, and former Notre Dame Professor Patricia O'Hara, one of Barrett's mentors. The judge will also deliver her own opening statement.

Trump returns to campaign trail

President Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail Monday with a rally planned in Florida less than two weeks after he announced he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19.

The White House has refused to say whether Trump has tested negative for the disease since contracting it, but the president told supporters Sunday he was "totally negative" for the virus, going beyond the public memos released from his doctors, who have said he is no longer a "transmission risk."

Trump has also claimed he is now immune from the virus, though medical experts say that is not guaranteed.

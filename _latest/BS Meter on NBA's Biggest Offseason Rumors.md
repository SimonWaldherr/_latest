  BS Meter on NBA's Biggest Offseason Rumors 
description: > 
  2 of 5David Zalubowski/Associated PressThe Lakers won the title, but the asterisk police are already out in force, picking apart their run.Through no fault of their own, the Lakers avoided Kawhi Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers and Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks.I don't think the Lakers wanted to make a major move because they thought they could do something on the buyout market.And I don't think the Pistons wanted to make a major move because Derrick was happy there.You know, the Lakers wanted to be involved in case the Clippers got involved or someone else, the Bucks or the Nuggets, whoever.

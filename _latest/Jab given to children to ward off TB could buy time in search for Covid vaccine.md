A jab usually given to protect children from tuberculosis could win more time to find an effective coronavirus vaccine, according to researchers.

The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine will be trialled globally on 10,000 people after it was found to stimulate the immune system. It could help fight off Covid-19 until more effective vaccines are discovered.

The University of Exeter is leading the UK arm of the trial and will recruit healthcare staff and care home workers.

The study, co-ordinated by the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, has received more than $10 million (£7.6 million) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to allow its global expansion.

The Peter Sowerby Foundation has contributed funding to support the Exeter trial site, and the UK joins study centres in Australia, the Netherlands, Spain and Brazil in the largest trial of its kind.

Participants will be given either the BCG vaccine – currently given to more than 100 million babies worldwide each year to protect against tuberculosis – or a placebo injection. Routine BCG vaccination in the UK was stopped in 2005 because of low tuberculosis rates in the general population.

"This could be of major importance globally," Professor John Campbell, of the University of Exeter Medical School, told the BBC. "Whilst we don't think it [the protection] will be specific to Covid, it has the potential to buy several years of time for the Covid vaccines to come through and perhaps other treatments to be developed."

  Senate Judiciary Committee votes to subpoena Twitter's Dorsey, Facebook's Zuckerberg 
description: > 
  The Senate Judiciary Committee approved subpoenas for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify on their companies' content moderation policies.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced the motion because of the companies' alleged censorship of a New York Post story about emails allegedly found on Hunter Biden's laptop and other election-related content moderation policies.The Senate Commerce Committee is calling on all three tech giants, which play a huge role in how Americans get their news, to discuss their policies regarding bias, disinformation and privacy before Nov. 3.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a member of both the commerce and judiciary committees, has called the companies "the robber barons of the twenty-first century."Twitter declined to comment on the vote, while FOX Business' inquiry to Facebook was not immediately returned.

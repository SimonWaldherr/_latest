Steve Cohen, because of his vast wealth and what could be done with it in procuring players, has been the people’s choice to gain control of the Mets. He also is solidifying another constituency — seasonal employees.

Cohen worked out a deal with the three unions that represent Citi Field seasonal employees such as food service workers, janitors and security guards that if he is approved to become Mets owner, he would pay each $500 a month this offseason to financially assist those who did not work a single game amid the pandemic in 2020, The Post has learned.

The deal would cover 1,140 workers over five months, so basically $2,500 per person between November and Opening Day. That is a $2.85 million commitment if Cohen’s ownership is approved.

The heads of the three unions that represent the seasonal workers — Kyle Bragg, president of SEIU Local 32BJ; Bill Granfield, president of UNITE HERE Local 100; and Richard Lanigan, business manager of OPEIU Local 153 — said in a joint statement:

“On behalf of the over 1,000 employees our unions collectively represent, we are extraordinarily grateful to Steve Cohen for this multi-million dollar commitment to help the seasonal workers of Citi Field.

“During this period of uncertainty, the food service employees, custodians, concessions staff and other vital workers are struggling to make ends meet while the stadium remains closed. There is no question that this pledge of financial assistance represents a lifeline for these hardworking families.

“We look forward to the quick approval of the sale of the Mets to Mr. Cohen to ensure our members can begin receiving the resources they need in this unprecedented time.”

According to two sources briefed on this matter, Cohen’s representatives initiated these conversations and negotiations were swift. Roughly 1,000 of those impacted work in food services as cooks, concession staff, etc. If approved, Cohen also already had promised to take the baton from current ownership, which is restoring full pay to front office workers who accepted cuts during the season.

MLB’s ownership subcommittee has begun to meet to discuss Cohen’s $2.4 billion agreement with Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz to purchase the Mets. That committee is charged with making a recommendation to the larger group. Cohen needs 23 “yes” votes from the 30 owners to gain control. That vote is expected in November, though MLB has not made public any firm plans yet for when it would be undertaken.

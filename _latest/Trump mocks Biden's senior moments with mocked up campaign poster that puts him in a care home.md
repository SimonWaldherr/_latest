President Trump mocked Joe Biden on Tuesday as he shared a tweet with a picture doctored to make his Democratic rival appear to be among a group of care home residents.

Donald Trump, 74, posted the image with the former Vice President's head Photoshopped into the frame filled with pensioners alongside 'Biden for President' with the 'p' crossed out to read 'Biden for Resident.'

It came after Biden, 77, - who Trump refers to as Sleepy Joe â€“ has made a number of gaffes in his bid for the White House.

On Monday, Trump regaled his Florida rally with Biden's latest gaffe where he appeared to forget the name of Republican Mitt Romney while he campaigned in Ohio, calling him a 'Mormon'.

Biden was sharing his opinion that Amy Coney Barrett shouldn't have to talk about her Catholic faith in the SCOTUS hearings.

'I got in trouble when we were running against the senator who was a Mormon - the governor,' Biden, who is Catholic, said of Romney.

After Texas Governor Rick Perry claimed Mormons were not Christians but in a cult, Biden defended Republican presidential candidate Romney, saying it was 'outrageous' for anyone in 2011 to suggest he should not be president because of his religion.

Trump also mocked Biden for saying he was 'running for Senate' at a Monday event.

'You know, we have to come together. That's why I'm running. I'm running as a proud Democrat for the Senate, when I ran as a proud Democrat for vice president, and I'm running as a proud Democrat for president,' Biden said.

He was elected to the US Senate in 1972 when he was 29, then was Barack Obama's VP from 2009 and joined the presidential race in 2019.

While his comment on Monday appeared to be more of a mixing of tenses, his mistake was more apparent in North Carolina in February.

'My name's Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you like what you see, help out. If not, vote for the other Biden,' he said. 'Give me a look though, okay?'

As Biden shared his opinion that Amy Coney Barrett shouldn't have to talk about her Catholic faith in the SCOTUS hearings, Biden didn't refer to Mitt Romney by name but mentioned: 'I got in trouble when we were running against the senator who was a Mormon - the governor'

Ex-White House physician Ronny Jackson said Tuesday on a press phone call arranged by the Trump Campaign that 'as a physician' he believes Biden does not have the 'mental capacity' or 'cognitive ability' to run the country

Trump used the recent opportunity to tweet the claim that Biden has dementia.

Ex-White House physician Ronny Jackson, who once claimed Trump could live to 200 years old and is now running for Congress as a Republican, said Tuesday that 'as a physician' he believes Biden does not have the 'mental capacity' or 'cognitive ability' to run the country.

'I've not accused him of having Alzheimer's or anything of that nature,' he added.

Jackson's medical expertise was called into question back in 2018 when he gave Trump a glowing health review despite test results indicating the president had a type of heart disease, worsening cholesterol and coronary calcium levels, and was obese.

Jackson's professionalism was also criticized that year when several colleagues came forward saying he was often drunk on duty, was nicknamed the 'candyman' because of the way he handed out drugs.

The attacks on Biden came as opinion polls suggested that the traditional Republican stronghold of senior in Florida are slowly moving closer to supporting Trump's opponent, Democrat Joe Biden.

A Quinnipiac poll on October 7 showed a comfortable advantage for Biden over Trump of 55 to 40 percent among voters aged 65 or over in Florida.

Biden made a flying visit to Florida on Tuesday to address seniors.

'You know, we have to come together. That's why I'm running. I'm running as a proud Democrat for the Senate, when I ran as a proud Democrat for vice president, and I'm running as a proud Democrat for president,' Biden said on Monday

'The only senior that Donald Trump cares about is the senior Donald Trump,' Biden told a small gathering at a retirement community center in Pembroke Pines, north of Miami on Tuesday

'The only senior that Donald Trump cares about is the senior Donald Trump,' Biden told a small gathering at a retirement community center in Pembroke Pines, north of Miami.

'He's never been focused on you,' Biden said. 'You are expendable, you are forgettable, you are virtually nobody. That's how he sees this.'

Coronavirus has killed 215,000 Americans and turned many of the elderly against President Donald Trump in a crucial election year.

More than 15,300 people have died of the disease so far in Florida.

Florida, with 14 million voters, has historically had a high proportion of older citizens in the United States (20.5 percent) because of all the pensioners who come to its balmy climate for their retirement.

At the same time it is crucial in elections because it carries 29 of the 270 electoral colleges votes needed to win the White House, and, just adding to the suspense, its results are generally very difficult to predict.

Vice President Mike Pence went to The Villages on Saturday where he called on supporters not to heed the polls and to vote to ensure that 'America remains America.'

According to pictures posted on Facebook by Democrats in The Villages, a small airplane flew over the Pence gathering trailing a banner for the community's 100,000 residents to read.

It said, 'Pence is why you can't see your grandkids.'

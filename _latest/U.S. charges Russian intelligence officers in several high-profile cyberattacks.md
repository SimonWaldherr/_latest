  U.S. charges Russian intelligence officers in several high-profile cyberattacks 
description: > 
  The alleged hackers are all members of the same military intelligence agency — the GRU — which was previously charged in connection with efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.But the new indictment does not charge these members with U.S. election interference.Rather, they stand accused of what Justice Department officials say who is the single most disruptive and destructive series of cyber attacks ever attributed to one group.The charges lay out a breathtaking series of attacks and attempts attributed to the group, also known as Unit 74455 and which cybersecurity researchers have dubbed the Sandworm Team.But the viral nature of the malware caused it to spread widely, infecting systems around the world and in the United States.

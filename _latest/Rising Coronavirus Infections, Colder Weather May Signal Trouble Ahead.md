Coronavirus infections in the U.S. have been on the rise for over a month, reaching levels that haven't been seen since early August – and that's just as colder weather starts to move in for much of the country.

With the seven day average of new daily cases topping 50,000, some are starting to voice concerns about the state of the country's outbreak as it heads deeper into fall, which will force more people indoors where the virus is believed to spread more easily. The challenge could also be compounded by the flu season.

"Many worry that COVID-19 will prove more difficult to handle during cold weather, thanks to a compounding flu season and inherent viral seasonality. If that's the case, even places that have already seen significant viral activity may reignite," experts from The COVID Tracking Project wrote in a recent blog.

Infection spikes that were fueled by states like Arizona and Florida over the summer have shifted into the Midwest. Wisconsin in particular is "now experiencing outcomes that mirror the beginning of what happened in some Sun Belt states in the late spring," according to the project.

Leading infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said this week that he hopes the numbers "jolt the American public into a realization that we really can't let this happen, because it's on a trajectory of getting worse and worse." He told CNN that the rising numbers are "the worst possible thing that could happen as we get into the cooler months."

The daily case count for the U.S. after the latest peak also did not see a decline to the same extent as after the first peak, prompting Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, to speculate to The New York Times that "we might see even more cases during the next peak than we did during the summer."

New infections in the Midwest and South account for more than three-fourths of the nation's total new cases. Still, every region is seeing some level of increase in infections.

Hospitalizations across the country are already increasing. Over 37,000 people are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, compared to last month's low of 28,600.

Daily fatalities remain on the decline, though this number tends to lag behind increases in cases and hospitalizations. The South makes up more than half of new deaths when broken down by region.

A widely cited coronavirus model predicts nearly 395,000 deaths in the U.S. by the beginning of February. The current U.S. death toll stands at over 217,000.

With speculation that a vaccine won't be widely available until the spring, some Americans have abandoned mitigation measures. Infections have grown especially among young adults, with outbreaks forcing some colleges and universities to return to remote learning.

These trends are not limited to the U.S. Canada and several countries in Europe are starting to reimplement restrictions in an effort to control the spread of the virus.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last week that the country is "at a tipping point in this pandemic."

He also announced this week that the U.S.-Canada border will remain closed until the U.S. gets the virus under control.

"We have committed to keeping Canadians safe and we keep extending the border closures because the United States is not in a place where we would feel comfortable reopening those borders," Trudeau told "The Start" radio program.

Carissa Etienne, the World Health Organization's regional director for the Americas, said at a recent news conference that "the state of the pandemic in the Americas remains complex."

She noted that Canada "is currently facing its second wave, and areas that were not previously affected are now surpassing the numbers seen during the first wave."

WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said Thursday that Europe's new infections are at their highest point since the start of the pandemic.

A U.K. health official announced on Thursday that London will move to the second-highest coronavirus alert level. Mitigation measures include no gatherings with other households in indoor settings and limiting outdoor gatherings to six people or fewer.

In France, President Emmanuel Macron this week renewed his country's state of emergency that previously ended in July, allowing further restrictions to be put in place. He announced curfews for major cities for at least a month.

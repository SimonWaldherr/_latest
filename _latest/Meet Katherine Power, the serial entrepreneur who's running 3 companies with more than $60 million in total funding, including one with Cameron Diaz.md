Katherine Power is the serial entrepreneur behind three brands that have collectively raised over $60 million in venture capital and strategic funding.

A journey that began in 2006 with a lifestyle site called Who What Wear has now expanded to two other brands that reach beyond fashion, and her business savvy has taken trillion dollar industries from beauty to alcohol head on.

Her second venture, Versed, is a 30-product line of skin-care options available in more than 3,000 stores across the US and Canada. But her most recent venture is Avaline, the "clean-wine" brand she cofounded with her best friend Cameron Diaz.

Power said the idea for Avaline stemmed from an empty space they saw in the market for a healthier, affordable wine — one that's made from organic grapes. Finding that gap in a market to fill, or "white space," as Power calls it, has been a key strategy she's used throughout her entrepreneurial career. Avaline sold 120,000 bottles of white and rosé in the first two months of business, according to an Avaline press release, and Power said this success led to plans to launch a red this fall.

How Who What Wear took off

When she and cofounder Hillary Kerr launched Who What Wear in 2006, they had been colleagues at Elle magazine and saw white space for fashion online.

And so they brought it there, with Who What Wear's coverage spanning fashion industry news, trends, celebrity style, wardrobe, and more.

Beginning with an opportunity to bring print magazine sensibilities to the internet, and to make magazine style content more accessible while linking out to fashion e-commerce retailers, Who What Wear started with a single newsletter everyday, and caught on fast.

In 2008, Power and Kerr brought on an MBA to run the "business" side of things, while they focused on the content and the creative. But as Who What Wear grew, so did Power, and soon their board of directors saw her as the brand's necessary leader. "I stepped into the CEO role in 2014 and never looked back," she said.

"People thought we were crazy for leaving our glamorous jobs at a glossy fashion magazine, but we saw the potential in digital," Power said, adding that at the time vogue.com was essentially a splash page to subscribe to print Vogue.

It wasn't an easy venture, with Power even having to borrow money from her now husband — then a very new boyfriend — to keep the lights on.

The empty space they found in the market, in combination with their ability to diversify the company's revenue relatively early in the life of the business, was fundamental to their success, she said. Who What Wear is now 14 years old, and Power said consumers have never loved the brand more. The team is able to focus on content, commerce, and the branding Power loves, she added.

"We went from being an online-media company to a consumer-brand incubator," she said of Who What Wear, which has a community of over 9 million across its social-media accounts.

How she got here

Despite her status as a serial entrepreneur, Power said she didn't always know she'd end up as a businesswoman.

She was home-schooled as a child and emancipated at 16 to work "adult hours" on film and TV sets. When she moved out and began her career at 17 as a professional dancer in Los Angeles, she encountered a lot of people saying "no" and a lot of competition — both key experiences that shaped her mindset as an entrepreneur today.

Instead of going to college, Power went to work for a film producer at Touchstone. She said she loved it but after a few years moved on to work for prominent LA event producers, where she fell in love with marketing. Several years later, Power pivoted to publishing, where she became the West Coast editor for Elle and Elle Girl.

Of her start with Who What Wear, Power said "there was no model to follow. It was the wild, wild west and we were paving our own way." But she's glad she took the risk and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Proud of her achievements and energized about her ventures, Power is always looking forward. "The sickness of an entrepreneur is that you never feel like you've made it," she said. "This is what drives us to the next stage.

And of her entrepreneurial journey, she added that starting her own business was a big decision in hindsight, but a relatively easy decision at the time. "I bet every dollar in my savings account on our eventual success, with no background in business and barely a high-school diploma."

At separate town hall events Thursday, the two people vying for the presidency answered questions from voters, though not in the intended debate format. Donald Trump and Joe Biden were in different states, in front of different crowds and on competing television channels

Trump refused to condemn QAnon and didn't deny having $400 million in debt during his NBC event while Biden gave a vague answer on court packing and was pressed by an African American voter on how he would turn out the Black vote live on ABC.

With just 18 days to before Election Day, the two campaigns are waging ferocious advertising campaigns in a half-dozen battleground states with Florida, Arizona and Pennsylvania the crown jewels that could decide the race.

Topics for final presidential debate announced

President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will face some familiar topics at the final presidential debate Thursday.

The coronavirus pandemic, race in America and climate change are among the subjects they‚Äôll likely be asked about, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced Friday.

Moderator Kristen Welker, White House correspondent for NBC News, may also cover the broad topics of ‚ÄúAmerican families,‚Äù national security and leadership.

The topics could be changed, depending on news developments before Thursday. The 90-minute debate is scheduled to begin at 9:00 p.m. ET from Belmont University in Nashville.

The debate commission canceled the second debate after Trump refused to take part when it was moved to a virtual format.

Instead, Trump and Biden participated in separate town halls.

During Biden‚Äôs town hall on ABC, he said he expects to debate Trump as scheduled on Oct. 22. He also expects the candidates to be tested before the event.

During Trump‚Äôs town hall, the president said he ‚Äúprobably‚Äù was tested before the first presidential debate on Sept. 29.

Trump vows to deliver vaccine to nursing home residents at no cost

President Donald Trump on Friday announced that his administration had finalized a partnership with CVS and Walgreens that would enable nursing home residents to receive a vaccine at no cost.

The president, 74, vowed a vaccine would be available before the end of the year despite his own federal health experts saying that timeline is highly unlikely, and vowed that senior citizens would be "first in line."

"I am moving heaven and earth to safeguard our Seniors from the China Virus, to deliver life-saving therapies in record time, and to distribute a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year," Trump told a crowd at an event billed as "Protecting America's Seniors" in Fort Myers, Florida. "Seniors will be the first in line for the vaccine."

Trump is trying to shore up support among senior citizens, a key voting bloc that helped him win four years ago but which recent polling suggests has eroded in recent months.

"I am deeply aware that America‚Äôs 54 million seniors have borne the heaviest burden of the China Virus," Trump said.

A CNN/SSRS poll from Oct. 6 showed Joe Biden leading Trump by 21 points among voters 65 and older. But a recent Washington-ABC News poll found that the septuagenarian candidates are tied among older voters.

Trump, who has been widely criticized for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has zeroed in on older voters in the final stretch of the campaign.

In recent days the Trump campaign has released a television ad pitching the president as a better advocate for the elderly while last week Trump shared a video on Twitter in which he directly spoke to seniors and vowed to make the drugs he was treated with for COVID-19 more widely available.

The president on Friday opened up about his own experience with the coronavirus and boasted about the experimental antibody treatment by New York biotech company Regeneron.

"It's really amazing what happened because I wasn't feeling great and the next day I wake up and I'm saying, like, 'Who can I fight today?'" he told the crowd.

Biden, for his part, is making a direct appeal to older voters.

The 77-year-old visited a community center for seniors in Florida earlier this week, where he said: "The only senior that Donald Trump cares about - the only senior - is the senior Donald Trump."

GOP Maryland governor writes-in Ronald Reagan rather than vote for Trump, Biden

Maryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan wrote-in former President Ronald Reagan on the ballot he mailed in last week rather than vote for either President Donald Trump or his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

The news, which was first reported Friday by The Washington Post, was confirmed on Twitter later that day by Hogan's communications director Mike Ricci.

"I know it‚Äôs simply symbolic. It‚Äôs not going to change the outcome in my state. But I thought it was important to just cast a vote that showed the kind of person I‚Äôd like to see in office," Hogan told the Post.

Hogan, a fierce critic of the president, did not vote for Trump in 2016 either, writing in his father, Larry Hogan, Sr., instead of voting for Trump or Hillary Clinton that year. Hogan told the Post he considered Reagan "my hero in politics" along with his father, Larry Hogan Sr., a three-term Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Nielsen ratings numbers show Biden beat Trump

The dueling town halls on competing networks crowned a winner, at least ratings-wise: Nielsen ratings estimates declare Joe Biden the victor over Donald Trump.

The ratings service says 13.9 million viewers tuned into the former vice president and Democratic candidate's town hall on ABC from 8 to 10 p.m. EDT Thursday night, moderated by George Stephanopoulos, while 10.7 million watched Savannah Guthrie referee voters' conversations with Trump from 8 to 9 EDT on NBC. Another 2.4 million watched Trump in simulcasts on MSNBC and CNBC, but even with those figures added in, Biden's town hall still beat Trump's by nearly 1 million viewers.

Biden again says he doesn't want to ban fracking

Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden again said he does not want to ban fracking during an ABC town hall Thursday night, adding, though, that ‚Äúit has to be managed very, very well.‚Äù

Biden was responding to a question from Pittsburgh resident Michele Ellison, identified as a Republican who has voted for Democrats, who asked him about fracking and said that the method for drilling for natural gas has sickened residents and killed wildlife in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Biden, who came to Pittsburgh in late August and said he did not want to ban fracking, reiterated that stance, but said methane emissions and water pollution must be controlled. He then transitioned to arguing that ‚Äúthe future rests in renewable energy,‚Äù such as wind and solar.

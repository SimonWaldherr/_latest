The number of people who filed for unemployment benefits fell only slightly last week to 840,000, marking the sixth straight week that claims have held roughly steady at a historically high level while the pandemic hammers the labor market.

The figure, released Thursday by the Labor Department, is a drop of 9,000 from the previous week's revised level.

Claims initially fell sharply after peaking at nearly 7 million in March but have effectively leveled off in the last couple of months, decreasing only incrementally. The four-week moving average was 857,000 last week. The pre-pandemic record sat just shy of 700,000.

An additional 464,000 people applied for jobless claims through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which was created by Congress to help people who would not otherwise qualify for unemployment benefits.

Large companies have recently announced mass layoffs that are likely not reflected in the data. Air carriers laid off or furloughed more than 35,000 workers at the beginning of the month, and The Walt Disney Co. said it would lay off 28,000 employees.

Despite the stagnation of jobless claims, the number of people receiving benefits on a continuous basis fell significantly in the week ending Sept. 26, dropping by 1 million to nearly 11 million. The decrease is a sign that out-of-work Americans are finding new jobs or are being brought back from temporary layoff.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week released its monthly jobs report showing that the unemployment rate decreased to 7.9% in September as the economy added 661,000 jobs â€“ less than half the number of jobs that were added in August.

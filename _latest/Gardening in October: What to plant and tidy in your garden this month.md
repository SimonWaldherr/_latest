Relentless showers (set to batter the UK for three months) from Storm Alex mark a premature end to balmy summer days but, if you look closely, there is beauty here, too. Milky cobnuts, hazelnuts and greengages are ripening; our vegetable patches and supermarket trolleys have never looked so good. Despite the chill in the air and the urge to stay in bed, there's plenty of tasks to keep you busy in the garden this month. Get digging!

Dreaming of a white Christmas

If you want to be surrounded by scented, flowering daffodils at Christmas, now is the time to start planting. It is always a bit of a hit-and-miss operation, but you greatly increase your chances by buying lots of bulbs and planting a few bulbs a week for the next few weeks. Paperwhites should only take around six weeks from planting to flower. From bakker.com

A mulch around the base of the hedge shows off the plants to their best and keeps roots cosy and plants healthy.

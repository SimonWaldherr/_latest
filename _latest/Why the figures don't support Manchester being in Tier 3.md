  Why the figures don't support Manchester being in Tier 3 
description: > 
  Serious coronavirus cases are rising so fast in Manchester, the Government claims, that intensive care beds will run out by mid-November.According to Downing Street, Manchester University Foundation NHS Trust is already at 70 per cent occupancy, while 91 per cent of beds at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust are taken up.But the problem with these figures are they are actually better than those at the same time last year.No wonder, then, that Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Manchester, has criticised the Government for using "selective statistics" and stoking fear needlessly."Greater Manchester's ICU occupancy rate is not abnormal for this time of year and is comparable to the occupancy rate in October 2019," Mr Burnham said earlier this week.

<div><p>The figures, at first glance, seem terrifying. Serious coronavirus cases are rising so fast in Manchester, the Government claims, that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/manchester-hospital-capacity-will-overwhelmed-three-weeks-says/">intensive care beds will run out</a> by mid-November.&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/manchester-hospital-capacity-will-overwhelmed-three-weeks-says/">According to Downing Street</a>, Manchester University Foundation NHS Trust is already at 70 per cent occupancy, while 91 per cent of beds at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust are taken up.&#160;</p>
<p>Surely a clear case for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/boris-johnson-manchester-tier-3-lockdown-brexit-news-latest/">Tier 3 restrictions</a>? But the problem with these figures are they are actually better than those at the same time last year.&#160;</p>
<p>In the last week of October 2019, 87 per cent of Manchester's ICU beds were full and 96 per cent at Salford, according to NHS England data &#8211; and the UK had a very mild flu season last year, with far fewer admission and deaths than normal.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Manchester, has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/19/boris-johnson-urged-reintroduce-shielding-instead-imposing-manchester/">criticised the Government</a> for using "selective statistics" and stoking fear needlessly.</p>
<p>"Greater Manchester's ICU occupancy rate is not abnormal for this time of year and is comparable to the occupancy rate in October 2019," Mr Burnham said earlier this week. "Providing information about individual hospitals does not reflect that our hospitals work as a system to manage demand."</p>

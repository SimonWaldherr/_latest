  Top Trades, Landing Spots for Steven Stamkos 
description: > 
  0 of 5Gene J. Puskar/Associated PressAll certainly seems right with the Tampa Bay Lightning.The team erased a colossal 2018-19 playoff disappointment with the second Stanley Cup in franchise history late last month and, even in an era of pandemic-prompted salary-cap freezes, seems stocked with enough high-end talent to remain long-term relevant in the Eastern Conference and beyond.What you might notice is that Steven Stamkos, who's been with the team since his draft selection in 2008 and was first to skate the Stanley Cup around the bubble ice at Edmonton's Rogers Place, isn't on that list.The veteran captain was essentially lost for the season after undergoing surgery to repair a core muscle in early March.Take a look at what we came up with and let us know what you think in the comments section.

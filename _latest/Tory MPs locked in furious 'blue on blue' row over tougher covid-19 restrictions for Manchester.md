  Tory MPs locked in furious 'blue on blue' row over tougher covid-19 restrictions for Manchester

  A furious ‘blue on blue’ row has erupted between northern Tory MPs and southern colleagues who have urged Manchester to accept tier three covid restrictions in order to save the nation from another national lockdown.The Conservative Party last night descended into fierce infighting after backbenchers in a string of ‘redwall’ seats hit out at an “ill-advised” letter sent to Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester.Tensions between the north and south were laid bare both in public and via an internal party WhatsApp group, in which northern MPs accused the signatories of throwing them “under a bus” in order to curry favour with Number 10.Organised by Jerome Mayhew, the MP for Broadland, the letter called on Mr Burnham to “engage” with the Government’s regional approach in order to spare other areas the “pain” of tougher blanket restrictions.It was also addressed to Sir Keir Starmer, in what critics have interpreted as a deliberate attempt to cast the controversy as a party political dispute with Labour.

<div><p>A furious &#8216;blue on blue&#8217; row has erupted between northern Tory MPs and southern colleagues who have urged Manchester to accept tier three covid restrictions in order to save the nation from another national lockdown.&#160;</p>
<p>The Conservative Party last night descended into fierce infighting after backbenchers in a string of &#8216;redwall&#8217; seats hit out at an &#8220;ill-advised&#8221; letter sent to Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>Tensions between the north and south were laid bare both in public and via an internal party WhatsApp group, in which northern MPs accused the signatories of throwing them &#8220;under a bus&#8221; in order to curry favour with Number 10.</p>
<p>In a series of testy exchanges, one redwall MP branded their colleagues &#8220;absolute pillocks&#8221;, adding that the controversy had made Dominic Cummings&#8217; trip to Durham during lockdown look like a &#8220;storm in a teacup.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scale of the backlash has sent shock waves through the party, with one insider telling The Daily Telegraph on Sunday that the situation was now &#8220;really dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>It came after 20 MPs on Saturday wrote to Mr Burnham urging him to drop his opposition to the region being placed under the highest level of restrictions.&#160;</p>
<p>Organised by Jerome Mayhew, the MP for Broadland, the letter called on Mr Burnham to &#8220;engage&#8221; with the Government&#8217;s regional approach in order to spare other areas the &#8220;pain&#8221; of tougher blanket restrictions.</p>
<p>It was also addressed to Sir Keir Starmer, in what critics have interpreted as a deliberate attempt to cast the controversy as a party political dispute with Labour.&#160;</p>

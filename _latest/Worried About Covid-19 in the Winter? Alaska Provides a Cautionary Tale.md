  Worried About Covid-19 in the Winter? Alaska Provides a Cautionary Tale

  “It’s going to be a very tough fall and winter for the entire world,” he said.In the pandemic of 1918, influenza killed more than half of the residents in some of Alaska’s Native communities.That history surfaced in the spring, when Alaska was deciding whether to move ahead with a fishing season that would draw thousands of people from elsewhere.Community members balked at the possibility of bringing the virus to areas that had managed to have few if any infections.Dr. Zink said that while the contact-tracing goal had been to keep tabs on people daily, that has changed to less-frequent contacts.

Mike Dunleavy said that he had expected cases would go up as the weather changed, and that the state had continued to build out supplemental hospital capacity should it be needed.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a very tough fall and winter for the entire world,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In the pandemic of 1918, influenza killed more than half of the residents in some of Alaska&#8217;s Native communities. The virus had arrived by boat from Seattle, where crews had screened passengers to prevent any spread, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nomenugget.com/news/100-years-ago-flu-pandemic-ravaged-regional-communities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only to have an outbreak begin in Nome</a> in the days after the ship docked. Most of the territory&#8217;s deaths during the pandemic <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/VitalStats/Documents/PDFs/AK_1918Flu_DataBrief_092018.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">occurred over the subsequent weeks</a>.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That history surfaced in the spring, when Alaska was deciding whether to move ahead with a fishing season that would draw thousands of people from elsewhere. Community members balked at <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/us/coronavirus-alaska-fishing-copper-river.html" title="">the possibility of bringing the virus</a> to areas that had managed to have few if any infections.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The season ultimately went ahead with extensive testing and restrictions, including fences that kept workers in processing facilities quarantined to their sites so that any infections could not spread into communities. Officials believe it was largely a success.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The state has also embraced strict strategies at its airports, where arriving passengers must present proof of a recent negative coronavirus test or pay for a test and await results in quarantine. Before leaving the terminal in Anchorage, passengers are funneled to a row of tables where people wearing protective equipment work behind plexiglass shields checking paperwork and informing those found deficient about testing options and quarantine mandates.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But challenges remain. Dr. Zink said that while the contact-tracing goal had been to keep tabs on people daily, that has changed to less-frequent contacts. Public health officials have set a goal to reach every infected person within 24 hours of diagnosis, but with so many cases emerging in recent days, that has at times slid to 48 hours.</p></div>

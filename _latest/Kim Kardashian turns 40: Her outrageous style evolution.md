<div><p>Kim Kardashian is ringing in the big 4-0 on October 21 &#8212; undoubtedly in style.</p>
<p>It seems almost impossible to remember a time when we weren&#8217;t keeping up with her style, after more than a decade of naked dresses and biker shorts.</p>
<p>The reality star, influencer, beauty mogul, mother of four and wife of Kanye West has spent the past decade serving her fanbase look after look, whether it&#8217;s front row at Paris Fashion Week, on an ice cream run with her kids or a casual post on her Insta grid (who could forget <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmw6iyPF0DN/?utm_source=ig_embed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that Gucci thong</a>?).</p>
<p>Her look has evolved from Herv&#233; Leger bodycon dresses to pencil skirts and sweaters, but her dedicated enthusiasm for fashion runs deep.</p>
<p>Here, a look at some of Kardashian&#8217;s key style moments.</p>
<h2>2007</h2>
 
<p>Less than a month after the first episode of &#8220;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&#8221; aired, the show&#8217;s budding star walked the red carpet at a party for Playboy&#8217;s December 2007 issue. She sported a look &#8220;KUWTK&#8221; fans came to know and love: a bodycon dress and the then-ubiquitous nude peep-toe Christian Louboutin heel.</p>
<h2>2011</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian &#8212; at the time married to NBA player Kris Humphries (she famously filed for divorce 72 days after they wed) &#8212; wearing her signature bandage dress in Las Vegas in 2011.</p>
<h2>2013</h2>
 
<p>While pregnant with North in 2013, Kardashian was widely <a href="https://nypost.com/2013/03/27/pregnant-kim-kardashian-dressed-to-ill-in-ny-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized</a> for wearing this belted Lanvin dress and clear Louboutin heels instead of more conventional maternity threads.</p>
<h2>2013</h2>
 
<p>It was the dress that inspired a million memes. Designed by Riccardo Tisci, then the head of Givenchy, Kardashian&#8217;s 2013 Met Gala dress sent the internet into a tizzy. Kardashian was compared to everything from a vintage sofa to Mrs. Doubtfire.</p>
<h2>2014</h2>
 
<p>Worn in Paris the night before her wedding in 2014, Kim&#8217;s short, figure-flaunting Balmain frock shook the dust off the storied French fashion house. A year and a half later, Kardashian wannabes brawled over Balmain x H&amp;M&#8217;s price-friendly riff on this look.</p>
<h2>2014</h2>
 
<p>In 2014, six months after tying the knot with Kanye West, Kardashian poured every ounce of her famous curves into this <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/03/04/why-latex-is-moving-from-the-red-room-to-the-red-carpet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latex Atsuko Kudo dress</a>. Probably sweaty, but definitely sexy.</p>
<h2>2015</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian&#8217;s second pregnancy with baby Saint in 2015 didn&#8217;t put her off racy lace, like this skin-baring, black Givenchy gown.</p>
<h2>2016</h2>
 
<p>In Kim Kardashian&#8217;s world, biker shorts are always happening. So are furry slides, sheer bras, cupless denim corsets and a varsity-inspired robe coat &#8212; and, ideally, all at once, as shown here in a 2016 paparazzi shot.</p>
<h2>2016</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian, an early adopter of <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/03/29/underwear-is-the-new-outerwear/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lingerie dressing</a>, wore this slinky look to Paris Fashion Week in 2016. But it&#8217;s momentous for more than the front-row snaps: Just a few hours later, she was <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/kim-kardashian-robbed-in-paris/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">held at gunpoint and robbed of more than $10 million worth of jewelry</a> at her hotel.</p>
<h2>2017</h2>
 
<p>Between the scant tank bra and the sparkly skirt&#8217;s thigh-high slit, this 2017 look left little to the imagination. (Even her ankles were on display in clear heels!) When Kardashian wore this, she and Kanye had just announced they&#8217;d be using a surrogate to have their third child.</p>
<h2>2017</h2>
 
<p>No pants? No problem. A newly blond Kardashian worked a <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/08/kim-kardashian-goes-basically-bottomless-nyfw/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sheer legging</a> (styled with high-cut undies underneath), bra top and clear mule during New York Fashion Week in September 2017. Online hysteria ensued.</p>
<h2>2017</h2>
 
<p>When Kardashian wore this minimalist, relaxed Tom Ford suit to the 2017 LACMA gala, the usually figure-flaunting star reminded us all that she can throw a sartorial kurveball.</p>
<h2>2018</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian attended 2018&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/07/the-top-moments-of-the-2018-met-gala/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;Heavenly Bodies&#8221; Met Gala</a> dripping in gold &#8212; Versace chainmail gold, to be exact.</p>
<h2>2018</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian arrived at the CFDA Awards in June 2018 to collect the inaugural Influencer Award dressed every bit the part. This stunning two-piece ensemble by Rick Owens was a surprisingly relaxed &#8212; but jaw-droppingly chic &#8212; choice for the reality star with a penchant for naked dressing.</p>
<h2>2018</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian made a bold appearance (and return to Paris Fashion Week <a href="https://pagesix.com/2018/10/22/kim-kardashian-is-grateful-for-paris-robbery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after being held at gunpoint</a> in 2016) at Virgil Abloh&#8217;s debut show for Louis Vuitton menswear in June 2018. Decked in one of Abloh&#8217;s ubiquitous utilitarian designs, Kardashian personalized it with her signature accessories: biker shorts and strappy high heels.</p>
<h2>2018</h2>
 
<p>The reality star has never met a neon bodycon she didn&#8217;t like, like this skin-tight vintage Versace mini, which she poured herself into while attending What Goes Around Comes Around&#8217;s 25th-anniversary celebration in August 2018. Kardashian styled it with sleek shades and a Judith Leiber Swarovski-encrusted French fry purse that retails for well more than a Happy Meal. We could say something like &#8220;future&#8217;s so bright&#8221; but this look is already money.</p>
<h2>2019</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian&#8217;s love affair with luxury vintage was taken to the next level when the fashion icon strapped her famous curves into this Thierry Mugler Haute Couture Spring/Summer 1998 gown while attending the 2019 Hollywood Beauty Awards in Los Angeles. Barely there, this look was everything.</p>
<h2>2019</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian&#8217;s sartorial streak with Mugler peaked at the 2019 Met Gala when she dressed head-to-toe in a wet look that she <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/story/kim-kardashian-met-gala-corset-mugler-mr-pearl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described to Vogue</a> as, &#8220;this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping.&#8221; The vision was dreamed up by Mugler himself, who emerged from retirement (he hasn&#8217;t designed his own collection since 2003) to create this custom latex look. Its extreme cinched waist had Twitter users wondering if Kardashian had removed a rib (or two) in order to fit into the dress.</p>
<h2>2020</h2>
 
<p>Kardashian made an appearance on Good Morning America in Feb. 2020 dressed as a literal ray of sunshine. Her monochromatic look &#8212; anchored by Bottega Veneta&#8217;s coveted strappy sandals &#8212; was one of her last public appearances mere weeks before the world went into COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

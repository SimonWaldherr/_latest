title: > 
  Joe Biden breaks silence on Hunter's laptop calling Rudy Giuliani Trump's 'henchman' 
description: > 
  'Wisconsin's Republican Senator Ron Johnson put out a statement — on Homeland Security letterhead — saying Hunter Biden, together with other Biden family members, profited off the Biden name,' reporter Adrienne Pedersen said.She asked Biden if there was any 'legitimacy' to what Johnson was claiming.'This is the same garbage Rudy Giuliani, Trump's henchman, it's a last-ditch effort in this desperate campaign to smear me and my family.'After the New York Post reported on information Rudy Giuliani says came from Hunter's laptop, Johnson said his committee was investigating and had met with a 'whistleblower.'However the email itself doesn't say the meeting happened, and the Biden campaign reviewed Bidens schedules and said it didn't.

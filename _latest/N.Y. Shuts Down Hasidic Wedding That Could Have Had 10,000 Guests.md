<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Some Orthodox voices, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/nyregion/orthodox-protests-borough-park.html" title="">including a growing faction of raucous young men</a>, have accused the government of targeting them because of their faith and religious life. Earlier this month, the governor ordered new shutdown restrictions in areas where cases were spiking.</p><p></p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Orthodox Jewish leaders announced a large community prayer scheduled for Tuesday in response to the shutdown of the wedding and the broader restrictions. The event, which will take place via phone, is not a protest, the leaders said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Cuomo on Sunday said that the state&#8217;s efforts to control outbreaks had been successful in reducing the positivity rate in the targeted neighborhoods, which he had divided into zones. As of Saturday, the state&#8217;s overall infection rate was 1.08 percent, the governor said, considerably lower than other states. But the rate is 3.19 percent in the areas with the highest infection rates, or &#8220;red zones,&#8221; which include neighborhoods near Williamsburg. The synagogue itself is not located in a hot spot.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;We are so aggressive every time we see the virus pop up &#8212; we run and hit it down,&#8221; the governor said about the state&#8217;s strategy for controlling outbreaks. &#8220;It&#8217;s exhausting but it&#8217;s effective.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">A number of factors &#8212; including distrust of scientific messaging and secular authority, a dedication to communal life and dense living conditions &#8212; have fueled the rise in the ultra-Orthodox community within the city.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">While New York State has one of the lowest rates of new cases, health officials are worried about another spike in the colder months, when people largely stay indoors and can more easily spread the virus in confined spaces. Mr. Cuomo noted on Sunday that even relatively small events, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/nyregion/virus-outbreak-sweet-sixteen.html" title="">such as a Sweet 16 party held on Long Island last month</a>, can spark an infectious outbreak.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The birthday party had more than 80 guests &#8212; above the 50-person maximum &#8212; and led to at least 37 cases and many more people forced into quarantine.</p></div>

<p>The Texas senator John Cornyn&#8217;s comments, <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/article246503045.html" class="u-underline">to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>, are the latest instance of a Republican under electoral pressure seeking to distance himself from an unpopular president, however gingerly, as polling day looms. Democrats are <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-senate/" class="u-underline">favoured to take the Senate</a>, potentially leading to unified government in Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what we found is that we&#8217;re not going to change President Trump,&#8221; Cornyn said. &#8220;He is who he is. You either love him or hate him, and there&#8217;s not much in between.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I tried to do is not get into public confrontations and fights with him because, as I&#8217;ve observed, those usually don&#8217;t end too well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump spent some of the weekend in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/17/donald-trump-ben-sasse-senate-republican-bloodbath" class="u-underline">a public fight</a> with Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Sasse criticised Trump in a call with constituents, lamenting among other things his treatment of women and the way he &#8220;kisses dictators&#8217; butts&#8221; and &#8220;flirts with white supremacists&#8221;.</p>
<p>Trump fired back with insults, forcing Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel on to the defensive on the Sunday talkshows.</p>
<p>Sasse is more or less assured of re-election in two weeks&#8217; time but his prediction of a &#8220;bloodbath&#8221; for Senate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans" class="u-underline">Republicans</a> with an unpopular president at the top of ticket may have stung Trump &#8211; and McDaniel &#8211; the most.</p>
<p>Cornyn, a former Senate majority whip, certainly knows what Sasse meant. He leads his Democratic challenger in the usually safe Republican state &#8211; <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/texas/" class="u-underline">but not by much</a>, some polls showing MJ Hegar within the margin of error.</p>
<p>Cornyn told the Fort Worth paper that &#8220;when I have had differences of opinion&#8221; with Trump, &#8220;which I have, [I] do that privately. I have found that has allowed me to be much more effective, I believe, than to satisfy those who say I ought to call him out or get into a public fight with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cornyn said he was happy to praise Trump publicly when they agreed, such as on judicial nominations and tax cuts. Subjects of disagreement included Covid-19 response; efforts to secure another relief bill; and the use of defense funds for border security.</p>
<p>On trade policy, Cornyn added: &#8220;I applaud him for standing up to China but, frankly, this idea that China is paying the price and we&#8217;re not paying the price here at home is just not true.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comment was mild enough not to immediately rile Trump, who was campaigning in battleground states. The Star-Telegram described Cornyn&#8217;s caution, saying he &#8220;noted that his friend, former [senator] Bob Corker [of Tennessee], who initially was on cordial terms with Trump&#8217;s White House, opted not to run for re-election in 2018 after clashing with Trump on issues such as a border wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corker was once considered as a running mate or secretary of state. Exasperated to the point of saying the White House was being run like an &#8220;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/bob-corker-white-house-adult-day-care-center-trump-twitter" class="u-underline">adult daycare centre</a>&#8221;, he retired in 2018.</p>
<p>Blasting back at Sasse, Trump showed he never forgets a slight. The Nebraska senator, the president tweeted, &#8220;seems to be heading down the same inglorious path as former senator Liddle&#8217; Bob Corker&#8221;, who became &#8220;totally unelectable&#8221; because of his criticism &#8220;and decided to drop out of politics and gracefully &#8216;RETIRE&#8217;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cornyn, 68, is hoping to defeat his 44-year-old opponent and secure a fourth six-year-term.</p>

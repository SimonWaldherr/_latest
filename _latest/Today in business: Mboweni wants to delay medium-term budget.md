Rand takes a hit after Trump shocker

The rand has weakened to R16.63/$ as investors dumped risky assets following a shock over the US economic stimulus plans. Markets faltered overnight after US president Donald Trump unexpectedly stopped negotiations over the plan.

The Dow plummeted as much as 1.5% immediately after the announcement.

Try spotting the moment where Trump just killed the stimulus https://t.co/M2O6hvFfl7 pic.twitter.com/BiVaOjFzi1 — Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) October 6, 2020

The abrupt pause leaves the US economy to recover without fiscal support many have deemed essential for fueling a timely bounce-back.

"I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business," the president said in a tweet.

This means Americans will not receive any additional economic relief — neither stimulus checks nor expanded unemployment benefits — until at least after the November election.

Insisting that Democrats only want to "bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat states," Trump said on Twitter that he would no longer negotiate with them over another stimulus package. Indeed, he insisted that the economy is "doing very well," despite there being 10.7 million fewer jobs today than there were six months ago, and said he would pivot instead to confirming his nominee Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

On 1 October, the Democrat-led House of Representatives passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package that included a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks for every American, with parents eligible to receive another $1,200 for each dependent child. The bill also proposed an additional $600 in federal unemployment benefits and $436 billion in aid for state and local governments to help cover the cost of providing assistance to out-of-work Americans.

But Senate Republicans negotiators balked at the price tag, and the two sides were unable to reach a deal.

Fuel price cuts from Wednesday

From Wednesday morning, 93 petrol will be 23 c/l lower, while 95 petrol will decrease by 32c/l. Diesel will be lowered with some 90c.

On Monday, oil prices rebounded as US president Donald Trump’s doctors suggested that he could be discharged from hospital today. Trump’s illness triggered uncertainty in the market. Brent crude oil was back above $40 a barrel. The rand was trading firmer at R16.44/$.

Sasol plans to sell a 50% stake in US base chemicals business, including its beleaguered Lake Charles project, to Dutch chemicals multinational LyondellBasell in a deal worth $2 billion. The proceeds will be used to lower Sasol's debt burden of $10 billion.

The unit will become a joint venture between the South African company and LyondellBasell, Sasol said in a statement Friday. The deal is expected to be completed this year.

Sasol announces sale of 50% of lake Charles in USA for $2bn. Total cost was around $12bn. So around $8bn lost on lake Charles. Still say might be right offer next year but no immediate urgency. Could happen if share price goes up — Wayne McCurrie (@WayneMcCurrie) October 2, 2020

The article has been updated to reflect that Sasol is selling a stake in its base chemicals business in the US.

Its share price is still down 30% from its highest level over the past year, but has doubled from recent lows.

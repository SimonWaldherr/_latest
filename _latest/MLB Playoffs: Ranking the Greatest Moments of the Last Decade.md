The 2020 Major League Baseball postseason isn't over yet, but there's already been one moment that ranks among the greatest playoff moments of the last decade.

We know this because we ranked the 15 best of the best.

We defined "the last decade" to mean 2011-2020 and considered in what game and situation that specific moments took place, as well as their significance in the grander schemes of recent and all-time MLB history. Sheer memorability was still another factor, though we limited ourselves to one (very obvious) World Series final out.

As far as what we weren't looking for, it's important to note that we drew a line between "moments" and "performances." As in, we narrowed our focus to events that occurred within minutes and even seconds, as opposed to hours.

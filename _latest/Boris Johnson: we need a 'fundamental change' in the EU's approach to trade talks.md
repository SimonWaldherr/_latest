Boris Johnson warned Britain would “embrace” a no-deal Brexit unless there is a “fundamental change” in the European Union’s approach to trade negotiations.

The Prime Minister said that unless the EU moves on its red lines of fishing and the level playing field guarantees, the UK would trade on WTO terms, with tariffs and quotas, from January 1.

“With high hearts and complete confidence, we will prepare to embrace the alternative and we will prosper mightily as an independent free-trading nation controlling our own borders, our fisheries and setting our own laws,” Mr Johnson said.

He refused to rule out further negotiations, despite missing his no-deal deadline of Thursday, the first day of an EU summit in Brussels, for an agreement “to be in sight”.

Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said he would be in London on Monday for talks. David Frost, the UK’s top Brexit official told him on Friday there was “no basis for negotiations”.

  Talking on the moon: Nasa and Nokia to install 4G on lunar surface 
description: > 
  With competition among Earth’s telecoms providers as fierce as ever, equipment maker Nokia has announced its expansion into a new market, winning a deal to install the first cellular network on the moon.The Finnish equipment manufacturer said it was selected by Nasa to deploy an “ultra-compact, low-power, space-hardened” wireless 4G network on the lunar surface, as part of the US space agency’s plan to establish a long-term human presence on the moon by 2030.The astronauts will begin carrying out detailed experiments and explorations which the agency hopes will help it develop its first human mission to Mars.Nokia’s network equipment will be installed remotely on the moon’s surface using a lunar hopper built by Intuitive Machines in late 2022, Nokia said.Among them, Elon Musk’s SpaceX received $53.2m for a demonstration of the transferring of ten metric tons of liquid oxygen between tanks on a starship vehicle, Nasa said.

There was no need to be a fly on the wall during the debate between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence. The fly was on the vice president's perfectly coiffed, white-haired head. And it was the star of the show.

The first and only vice presidential debate of the 2020 campaign season is not likely to change voters' minds. There were no meltdowns, no devastating zingers and no new revelations. The two contenders didn't scream or constantly interrupt each other – though Vice President Mike Pence had to be chastised numerous times by moderator Susan Page to finish his answer. Both avoided directly answering some questions.

So lacking in fireworks was the debate – drastically different from the chaotic display of the first presidential debate last week – that the black fly that made its way to the plexiglass-divided stage and settled on Pence's head became an easy distraction.

It was especially unfortunate timing for Pence, who was answering what was arguably the most critical question of the debate, a response to Harris's attack on President Donald Trump's refusal at the presidential debate to directly condemn white supremacy.

Pence began by vilifying a popular conservative target – the media – saying Trump's answers had been "selectively" edited to distort his response. Trump, Pence noted, has Jewish grandchildren. "This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people," Pence said, as the fly poised mute on his head.

Much of the debate came back to the major issue of the coronavirus pandemic, which had Sen. Harris of California declaring, with Trumpian superlative language, calling the administration's response to the crisis "the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country."

"They knew what was happening and they didn't tell you," she said. "They knew, and they covered it up. This administration has forfeited the right to reelection, based on that."

Pence retorted that "from the very first day, Donald Trump has put the health of Americans first" and said Democratic nominee Joe Biden and Harris's plan to deal with the pandemic – having universal testing, access to vaccines and protective gear – was pretty much what the Trump administration was already doing.

"It looks a little like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little about," Pence said, referring to Biden's acknowledgment in 1987 that he had cribbed from a British leader's speech – a revelation that contributed to his departure from the 1988 presidential campaign.

Asked directly why the White House would hold what was perhaps a "super-spreader" event at the White House, Pence put the risk on the American public.

"The president and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interests of their health," the vice president said.

Both appeared to have prepared lines to deliver for effect, even when the line didn't go directly to the question asked.

Pence, asked whether his home state of Indiana should outright ban all abortions if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v Wade, answered by saying, "Qassem Soleimani was responsible for the death of hundreds of American service members." Pence was referring to an Iranian commander killed by U.S. forces in January.

Harris responded by slipping in a reference to reports that Trump referred to slain veterans as "suckers" and "losers," something Biden frequently notes as his ticket seeks to win over military voters.

Harris avoided answering whether she and Biden would support "court-packing," or adding justices to the Supreme Court to counter the lopsided conservative bent the high court would take if Trump's nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is confirmed.

Harris instead denounced the Trump administration and GOP-run Senate for changing the rules they themselves set in 2016, when they refused to take up a nomination by President Barack Obama to the high court, saying it would be wrong to do so in an election year.

"The straight answer is that they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win the election," Pence said.

Asked about racial justice, Harris talked about the Biden-Harris plan for criminal justice reform, including eliminating cash bail and having a national database of police officers who break the law.

Pence criticized Harris and Biden for talking about "systemic racism," saying it was an insult to the American people and to "the men and women who serve in law enforcement." Before Page tried again to cut him off, Pence dropped a line about how his administration supports school choice, another important issue for conservatives.

Harris, too, took her chances to slip in topics that resonate with would-be Biden voters, in one case raising Trump's reported $750 federal tax bill as part of an answer to a question about transparency on Trump's health. She also several times mentioned threats to the Affordable Care Act, saying that if a person has a preexisting condition or is on a parent's health care plan, "they're coming for you."

Pence twice delivered what appeared to be a prepared zinger – that "you are entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts." The line, attributed to the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and invoked repeatedly by politicians over the past few decades, failed to rattle Harris.

The two did not engage in the sort of verbal throw-down Trump and Biden did last week, but there was tension over who was dominating the conversation. Page repeatedly had to interject, "thank you, Vice President," and "your time is up" as Pence continued to talk long past his allotted time – a risky tactic for a ticket that is doing very poorly among female voters in polls.

Harris, meanwhile, several times took the role of disapproving teacher with Pence, telling him, "Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. I'm speaking," when he tried to talk over her. And she pushed back on what she saw as efforts to diminish her record.

"I will not sit here and be lectured by the vice president on what it means to enforce the laws of our country," Harris said, going into detail about her professional record as a prosecutor and state attorney general. it wasn't a direct answer to a question posed by the moderator, but it did allow Harris to provide viewers with a brief biography of the woman who could be second-in-command.

Pence would not state what his role would be if, as Trump has alluded, the president would not agree to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost on election night.

"We're going to have a free and fair election. I know we have confidence in it," Pence said.

A “trailblazing” plan to reduce travel quarantine has been announced by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps; he has also ruled out testing at UK airports.

“We’re proposing a domestic test regime, where people land and wait a week, have a test and get early release,” said Mr Shapps, who is speaking at the annual Abta travel convention today.

“We’re also proposing an internationally recognised system, in which Britain would be a trailblazer, where tests and isolation take place prior to travel and after travel and would require no quarantine,” he added.

“There are two separate approaches that we're working on and Britain will be in the lead on both those fronts.”

Mr Shapps announced the launch of the Global Travel Taskforce last week. Its remit includes considering how a testing regime for international arrivals could be implemented to boost safe travel to and from the UK.

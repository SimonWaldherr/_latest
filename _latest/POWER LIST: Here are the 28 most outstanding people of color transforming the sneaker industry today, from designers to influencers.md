The sneaker industry is intrinsically bound to a variety of cultural influences, but that cultural impact is rarely seen beyond brands' outward messaging or campaigns.

For example, the sneaker industry is known to have roots in Black culture, but this does not correlate with the number of Black people in the industry as designers and executives.

But the pendulum is starting to swing.

The sneaker industry has never existed in a silo. From designers to consumers, the field is intrinsically bound to an array of cultural influences.

First and foremost, the sneaker community, as we know it today, has its roots in Black culture. Icons like Michael Jordan and Run DMC helped define the industry, while celebrities like Travis Scott and Beyonc√© give the industry relevance and excitement today.

Of course, the sneaker world is also a cultural melting pot that includes a wide range of communities. Chitose Abe's Japan-based Sacai label has become a major global brand since its 1999 founding, for example, and has become a major name in streetwear, featuring collaborations with Nike and Beats by Dre.

But when it comes to people of color in the sneaker industry, such cultural influences are rarely seen beyond a brand's outward messaging or campaigns. As the New York Times previously reported, fewer than 4.5% of the 1,700 Adidas employees at the Portland, Oregon, campus identified as Black, according to internal employment figures from the summer of 2019. In contrast, marketing campaigns and celebrity partnerships from Adidas are known to prominently feature artists and athletes of color, such as Kanye West and James Harden.

Adidas, Nike, and Under Armour have all recently acknowledged their part in maintaining a workplace lacking in diversity and inclusion, But more importantly, the sneaker industry has committed to changes.

Nike raised VP-level representation for underrepresented groups to 21% in 2019. Adidas announced a commitment to filling a minimum of 30% of new US Adidas and Reebok positions with Black and Latinx people. Meanwhile, the African American Footwear Forum (AAFF), an organization that works to address and solve diversity issues in the footwear industry, is looking to take stock of the industry's diversity and opportunity for Black people.

"People of Color are the heartbeat of the sneaker industry and epicenter of sneaker culture. They are our consumers, employees, athletes, and influencers," said Kris Wright, Nike's VP of global footwear for men's sport and lifestyle. "In order for brands to engage, understand and resonate with the communities they serve, their employee community must reflect those same POC communities so that those making product can relate and qualify their work with that of what our consumers would want to purchase."

Business Insider identified 28 outstanding people of color who are transforming the sneaker industry today. After a nomination process, final inclusion in the list was based on multiple factors, including an individual's impact on the sneaker industry as a whole or on the impact an individual has had on a company in which he or she has worked. The final list was determined through our reporting.

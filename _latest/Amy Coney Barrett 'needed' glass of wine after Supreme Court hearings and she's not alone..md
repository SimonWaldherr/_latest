Judge Amy Coney Barrett looked poised Wednesday entering the third day of Supreme Court nominee confirmation hearings. But it turned out Day 2 had been a tad stressful.

"I did have a glass of wine," Barrett disclosed Wednesday. "I'll tell you that I needed that, at the end of the day.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., did not grill Barrett for details.

“…let me just say on that kind of point you have a right to remain silent," Blumenthal joked.

Twitter had some fun.

During the confirmation hearings Wednesday, some noted a slip of the tongue by Barrett, who at one point said she would approach "every case with an open wine — open mind."

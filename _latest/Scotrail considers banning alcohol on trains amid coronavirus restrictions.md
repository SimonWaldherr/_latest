</p><p></p><p id="article-im-prompt"></p><p>&#8220;There has always been a concern with anti-social behaviour and assaults on staff, it's an ongoing issue,&#8221; Mick Hogg, regional organiser for the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, told the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-54586204"><i>BBC</i></a>.</p><p></p><p>&#8221;We certainly encourage our people to use the body cameras available in order to send a signal to people, and to report anti-social behaviour to the British Transport Police if it's serious.
</p><p>&#8220;A total ban on alcohol is something we've been advocating for a number of years.&#8221;
</p><p>According to Mr Hogg, train workers are still getting pushback from passengers about having to wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines.
</p><p></p><p>He added that an alcohol ban, though welcome, would be difficult for Scotrail employees to enforce.
</p><p>&#8220;We can only advise people they shouldn't be drinking and if that fails it's a matter for the BTP.
</p><p>&#8220;We certainly welcome a ban but it really begs the question - who is going to police it?&#8221;</p><p>Scotrail confirmed to <i>The Independent </i>that an alcohol ban &#8220;is something they are looking into&#8221; but had no further details to share at this stage.</p><p id="taboola-carousel-thumbnails"></p><p>It follows the news that <a href="/travel/news-and-advice/railcard-veterans-train-tickets-discount-b1030785.html">armed forces veterans can now apply for a railcard </a>that will offer a 34 per cent discount on many train tickets for journeys from 5 November.</p><p>Captain Sir Tom Moore, who served in the Second World War and raised millions for charity during lockdown, was presented with the first Veterans Railcard to be issued.
</p><p>The ninth national railcard is open to &#8220;UK veterans who served at least one day in Her Majesty&#8217;s Armed Forces or Merchant Mariners who have seen duty on legally defined military operations&#8221;. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which administers the scheme, estimates that 830,000 people will be eligible.

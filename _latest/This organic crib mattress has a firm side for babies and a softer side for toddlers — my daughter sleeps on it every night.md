It didn't seem comfortable, and it also didn't seem firm enough to be safe for an infant.&#160;</p><p>It was back to the drawing board, and the second time, I came up with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O6M4M8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=biipf_021220_colgate-eco-classica-iii-mattress-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004O6M4M8&amp;linkId=c5380729d4ba21496e6d02c74317a318" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored">Colgate Eco Classica III</a>.

In fact, your baby, placed on his or her back, should be the only thing in the crib. The only additional object you may place in the crib is a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-pacifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pacifier</a>, as they are thought to <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)</a>.&#160;</p><p>You should not be able to insert more than two fingers between the mattress and the slats of the crib. Additionally, the crib mattress should be <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firm</a> enough that it doesn't indent and conform to your baby's body.

</p><p>First and foremost, this mattress meets all of the safety guidelines listed above. It's a standard-sized mattress (27.5 inches by 51.75 inches by 6 inches) that fits perfectly in our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-emery-convertible-crib-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Children 4-in-1 Convertible Crib</a>. Once we convert the crib to a toddler bed, we'll still be able to use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O6M4M8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=biipf_021220_colgate-eco-classica-iii-mattress-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004O6M4M8&amp;linkId=c5380729d4ba21496e6d02c74317a318" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored">Colgate mattress</a>.&#160;</p><p>At 13 pounds, the mattress is very lightweight yet sturdy, and I had no problem getting it in the crib when I was still pregnant.</p><p>It's a dual-sided mattress, so there is a firmer side for infants and a softer side for toddlers. A clearly marked tag identifies each side. I'm very impressed with the firmness of the infant side of the mattress. Even after months of use, there was never an indentation where my daughter slept.&#160;</p><p>The toddler side is softer, but it's still much firmer than a regular mattress. This put my mind at ease when we flipped the mattress when my daughter was 14 months old.&#160;</p><p>An extremely firm mattress doesn't sound comfortable to us, but my daughter, who asks to get in her "trib" every night to go to bed, certainly doesn't seem to mind.&#160;</p><p>The outer layer, or cover of the mattress, has a food-grade waterproof backing. However, this cover is not removable. I haven't personally tested how well this waterproof backing works because I always put a second waterproof cover over the mattress to make changing the sheets in the middle of the night easier. I can attest that there are no crinkly sounds associated with the waterproof backing.&#160;</p><h2>Here's what makes this mattress a more eco-friendly option</h2><p>We can't avoid exposure to chemicals, plastics, and other harmful materials completely, but I appreciate products that try. When we're talking about something that my daughter spends a very large amount of time on, I want it to be as clean as possible. Colgate brands this mattress as eco-friendlier. Here are a few ways this mattress is greener than other options:&#160;</p><ul><li>It's <a href="http://greenguard.org/en/CertificationPrograms/CertificationPrograms_childrenSchools.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenguard Gold certified</a>, which means it emits very low levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that lower indoor air quality. I haven't noticed any chemical off-gassing smells coming from the mattress.&#160;</li><li>It uses rayon as a flame barrier rather than chemical flame retardants.&#160;</li><li>It's made from plant-based <a href="https://certipur.us/about-the-seal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CertiPUR-US certified foam</a>, which means it's made without formaldehyde, heavy metals, phthalates, and more.&#160;</li><li>It has a certified organic cotton cover. There is currently no industry-wide standard for organic crib mattresses. However, one of the main benefits of organic cotton is that it's grown without harmful synthetic pesticides and insecticides. This is important to me, especially in the outer layer that is closest to my daughter's skin.&#160;&#160;&#160;</li></ul><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>

A devoted mum who died in a horror smash along with three of her children had written some touching advice about parenting in her last blog post.

Zoe Powell tragically died alongside her two daughters, Phoebe, eight, and Amelia, four, and their six-year-old brother Simeon.

The 29-year-old had written about expecting her now 18-month-old daughter who survived the smash along with dad, Josh.

The crash has left the family's Chinnor, Oxford, community in shock.

The dad and baby are described as being in a “critical but stable” condition in hospital.

The crash has left the family's Chinnor, Oxford, community in shock.

People have paid tribute to the churchgoing parenting advice blogger, who also ran a business producing journals.

In a moving final post on her parenting blog last May, mummy Zoe had written about taking a break from blogging, as she prepared for the couple's fourth addition to her family.

She wrote candidly about the steps she was taking to prepare for the new arrival.

Zoe had not written a post since on her blog, T he Mama Book since - switching to her Instagram to post about family life in lockdown.

In the post, she wrote about finding mental space to enjoy motherhood, and how she was taking a temporary break from blogging and producing floral journals, to concentrate on being a mother-of-four.

The mum shared tips with followers about how she was preparing mentally for the exhaustion of welcoming the couple's fourth child.

She wrote: "Baby is (hopefully) just around the corner over here, and these weeks, months of preparation will soon be forgotten in a blur of feeding and sleeping and all those newborn things.

"I’ve done this before and yet I still wanted to make sure I prepared not only physically- our home- but also mentally.

"The sleep deprived fog can make it hard to think clearly and I know that if I can set some things in place now then hopefully the next few months will run smoother mentally as well as practically!"

She posted tips for preserving mental health when becoming a new mum - from reminding herself she was "capable" to accepting help from others.

Zoe also wrote about making time for herself and for sleep, rather than trying to "do it all."

She told followers how she had made a 'good things' list of activities that kept her happy - writing how she liked to be outside, listen to music, spend time alone or chat to a friend to give herself a break.

The mum also wrote of her Christian faith, saying she liked to place positive affirmation notes around her home and read bible verses to get through tough periods of sleep deprivation.

After taking a break from the blog and her journal business, Zoe had taken to posting parenting tips for entertaining little ones indoors during the coronavirus lockdown.

Her final post on October 3 captured scenes of her home on a rainy day as she enjoyed sippping coffee and cosying up in slippers.

Just over a week later, she and her family would be struck by tragedy in the A40 crash that witnesses described as a “scene from hell”.

The family’s silver Subaru collided with a HGV close to a railway bridge at 9.50pm on Monday.

Thames Valley Police said a 56-year-old lorry driver suffered minor injuries in the crash and did not need hospital treatment.

David Patchett, who lives on a narrowboat near the scene, called 999 after seeing people seriously injured.

He said: “There was a loud explosion, a horrendous noise which shook through the boat. It was enough to make your heart jump.

“I grabbed my phone and shoes and ran out at full pelt down the road while trying to dial 999. I knew it wasn’t a good sound.

“The first thing I saw was the lorry on the wrong side of the road and saw the driver was sat there okay.

“I continued running towards the car, that’s where I could have collapsed to my knees, it was an emotional rollercoaster.

“The car was in the middle of the road, it wasn’t just front-end damage it looked like it had been crumpled like a can.

“It was a horrifying thing to see and my first thoughts were nobody had survived, that’s how bad it was.”

Sgt Dominic Mahon, of Thames Valley Police, said the crash was an “absolute tragedy”.

He added: “This incredibly tragic incident has resulted in the deaths of four people from the same family.

“Our officers and colleagues from the other emergency services were dealing with an extremely upsetting scene.

“We will leave no stone unturned to ascertain what has caused this tragedy.”

Police appealed for witnesses or motorists who have dash-cam footage of the incident to come forward.

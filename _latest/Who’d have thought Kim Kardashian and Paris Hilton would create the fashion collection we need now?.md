  Who’d have thought Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton would create the fashion collection we need now?

  Several images featuring Kardashian West and Hilton were released on Instagram, alongside a behind-the-scenes video and model imagery of the collection.The whole collection is a stroke of genius, particularly on the marketing front.If anyone can bring back velour, it’s Kim and Paris, who, alongside Nicole Richie and Britney Spears, had elevated it to It status back in the early 00s.Then, cropped jackets and low-slung wide-leg trousers in the divisive fabric were worn with chunky trainers and monogrammed shoulder bags.In fashion, velour has gained a bad rap as velvet’s flimsier, less luxurious cousin, but in these tricky lockdown times, and with a concerning shortage of sweatpants reportedly on the horizon, the velour two-piece could be the lockdown fashion hero we need.

<div><p>Several images featuring Kardashian West and Hilton were released on Instagram, alongside a behind-the-scenes video and model imagery of the collection. It boasts seven pieces, with prices starting from $42 (&#163;32). Though it was both of their go-tos the first time round, a bubblegum pink iteration notably doesn&#8217;t feature, which instead has a minimal aesthetic that chimes with the Skims brand, with each piece available in four neutral shades.&#160;</p>
<p>The whole collection is a stroke of genius, particularly on the marketing front. &#8216;Major 2000s vibes! We&#8217;re bringing back velour,&#8217; was Kim&#8217;s Instagram caption. If anyone can bring back velour, it&#8217;s Kim and Paris, who, alongside Nicole Richie and Britney Spears, had elevated it to It status back in the early 00s.&#160;Then, cropped jackets and low-slung wide-leg trousers in the divisive fabric were worn with chunky trainers and monogrammed shoulder bags.&#160;The 2020 iteration is slim-fit, minimal and, dare I say it, quite stylish.&#160;</p>

The protest is the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/teacher-union-school-reopening-coronavirus.html" title="">latest example</a> of the difficulties that school districts and teachers around the country are navigating as they attempt to resume in-person instruction. On Wednesday, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/21/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates#i-am-heartbroken-that-today-we-have-to-close-our-doors-bostons-schools-freeze-their-reopening-plans" title="">Boston public schools suspended</a> the phased reopening of in-person classes. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Houston schools reopened its 280 schools on Monday. The next day, 16 of them were forced to close again because someone had tested positive on campus, according to the district. Administrators responded with an announcement on Wednesday that schools would no longer be closed when just a single person tests positive, a stricter policy than many other large districts across the nation had adopted.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Now it will take two sick people to close a campus. When there is just one, the infected person and others who were directly exposed will be isolated and &#8220;if possible, sent home,&#8221; and the campus will be disinfected overnight.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Learning will continue as normal, with students and staff remaining in their assigned classrooms throughout the day to limit movement and contacts,&#8221; the district said in a statement. &#8220;If two or more confirmed positive cases are reported on a campus, the campus will close and shift to virtual learning to adequately identify contacts of positive cases.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dozens of teachers in at least 35 campuses <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/education-news/2020/10/22/384495/houston-teachers-plan-sick-out-as-district-revises-when-covid-can-close-a-school/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called in sick</a> on Thursday to protest the district&#8217;s policies on social distancing &#8212;&#160;including allowing students to be within three feet of one another &#8212;&#160;and on class size, according to one of the leaders involved. Teachers with chronic health conditions have been forced to report to work while their applications for accommodations are reviewed, and requests to switch to virtual teaching are being denied even for people with cancer, the leader said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Responding to a request for comment about the sickout, the school district said it was working on a response.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/frances-robles" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="these-are-everyday-people-who-are-dying-a-study-offers-a-new-picture-of-the-lives-lost-to-the-virus"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#these-are-everyday-people-who-are-dying-a-study-offers-a-new-picture-of-the-lives-lost-to-the-virus">&#8216;These are everyday people who are dying&#8217;: A study offers a new picture of the lives lost to the virus.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="U.S. flags were placed on the National Mall in Washington last month when the country&#8217;s death toll from the coronavirus passed 200,000." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/us/22virus-briefing-yearslost2/merlin_177392340_7e9f33be-312b-45fb-99ae-0420ff4f1fca-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">U.S. flags were placed on the National Mall in Washington last month when the country&#8217;s death toll from the coronavirus passed 200,000.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There have been more than 220,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States, and each one represents years of potential life lost.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">They are years that might otherwise have been filled with moments rich and mundane: Time spent with family and friends. Trips to the grocery store. Late-night conversations on the phone. Tearful firsts with a newborn baby.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Staggering as the 220,000 number is, it may not fully capture the true toll of the pandemic, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.18.20214783v1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent analysis</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tabulating the ages of Americans known to have died of Covid-19, and tallying the number of years they might have lived had they reached a typical life expectancy, the report concluded that the virus had claimed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/health/coronavirus-statistics-deaths.html" title="">more than 2.5 million years of potential life in the United States</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Think of everything that a person does in a year,&#8221; said the author of the report, Stephen Elledge, a geneticist at Harvard. &#8220;Who among us would not give anything to have one more year with a parent, a spouse, a son or daughter, a close friend?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The report, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, comes as 37 states continue to see sustained increases in new infections, according to a New York Times database. Twelve have been roughly flat over the past couple of weeks. Only Hawaii is seeing consistent declines. On Wednesday, at least four states broke their single-day records for new cases reported.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Just last week, scientists published a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/world/white-house-embraces-a-declaration-from-scientists-that-opposes-lockdowns-and-relies-on-herd-immunity.html" title="">high-profile and discredited declaration</a> arguing that businesses and schools should be quickly opened and that people &#8220;who are not vulnerable&#8221; to the virus &#8212; presumably the young and healthy &#8212; should return to &#8220;life as normal&#8221; while older Americans remain cloistered from the coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Elledge&#8217;s analysis found that nearly half of the years lost were taken from people younger than 65.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;These are everyday people who are dying,&#8221; said Dr. Utibe Essien, a physician and health equity researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was not involved in the analysis. &#8220;They&#8217;re losing time with their kids, their grandkids, their opportunities to build their futures.&#8221; Dr. Essien was one of several experts who reviewed the study at the request of The New York Times.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-j--wu" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="forgotten-on-the-presidential-campaign-schools-in-crisis"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#forgotten-on-the-presidential-campaign-schools-in-crisis">Forgotten on the presidential campaign: schools in crisis.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="An elementary school in the Bronx.

Superintendents are warning of drastic budget cuts on the horizon. Teachers&#8217; unions are calling for standardized tests to be canceled for a second straight year. And millions of children are learning remotely &#8212; with little known about the long-term effects on their intellectual growth.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Yet none of this has been a big campaign talking point for either President Trump or former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It should really be a pivotal topic,&#8221; said Kisha Hale, principal of the upper grades at Eagle Academy Public Charter School in Washington.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Just this week, parents in one major city school system &#8212; Boston&#8217;s &#8212; had hopes dashed that their pre-K and kindergarten children might soon find themselves back in the classroom. With cases rising, the city <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/21/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates/i-am-heartbroken-that-today-we-have-to-close-our-doors-bostons-schools-freeze-their-reopening-plans" title="">put a hold on its school reopening plans</a> and even ended what little in-person teaching there already was, for so-called high-needs students.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was a microcosm of the disarray across the country as school districts try to get back to normal, or something resembling it. Several recent polls have suggested that the issue is a leading concern for many voters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With the lives of schoolchildren upended across the country, the presidential campaign&#8217;s lack of focus on the issue has frustrated parents and educators alike.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The subject of school reopening is not a major theme of either candidate&#8217;s ad campaigns, and it got less than a minute of airtime at the first debate between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump last month. Nor is it among the topics that Kristen Welker of NBC News plans to question them on at Thursday&#8217;s debate, though &#8220;Fighting Covid-19&#8221; is.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">To the dismay of parents and educators, the discussion has been limited partly because states and local districts have a larger role than the federal government in running &#8212; and funding &#8212; schools.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">When Mr. Trump brings up schools at rallies, he can generally be counted on to say that he will fight for school choice and protect charter schools. And he has consistently called for schools to reopen, threatening at one point to withhold federal funds from districts that resist. But he has said little to nothing about the role of federal funding in helping districts reopen safely.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has presented ideas on how and when school districts should reopen. But he has not addressed the divisions that exist within his own party about what conditions need to be in place before sending students and teachers back to classrooms.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Nor has either campaign put forth ideas on improving remote learning, or on how colleges should handle the return to campuses &#8212; deeply relevant issues to huge slices of the electorate.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/abby-goodnough" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="osha-is-under-fire-over-its-regulation-of-meatpacking-plants"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#osha-is-under-fire-over-its-regulation-of-meatpacking-plants">OSHA is under fire over its regulation of meatpacking plants.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Beatriz Rangel, center, at the grave of her father Saul Sanchez, a JBS employee who died of Covid-19 in April after an outbreak at the meat processing plant in Greeley, Colo.

Like Germany, Greece had done well in initially controlling the virus, but cases have been steadily rising. The country has recorded 27,334 total cases and 534 deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Poland, which has seen cases explode in recent weeks, set another record on Thursday, reporting more than 12,000 cases, according to Reuters. To control the spread of the virus, the country has made masks mandatory and limited hours for bars and restaurants, but more restrictions were expected Thursday. Poland&#8217;s deputy prime minister and de facto leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is in quarantine after coming into contact with an infected person.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Belgium, which had managed to contain the virus over the summer, has also been seeing cases spike since mid-September. On Thursday, the country&#8217;s foreign minister, Sophie Wilmes, was admitted to an intensive care unit with the virus. A spokesperson said she was stable and conscious, but required professional help. Ms. Wilmes had served as prime minister until the beginning of October. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Netherlands reported at least 9,000 new daily cases on Thursday, a record.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In other developments around the world:</p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Russia&#8217;s</strong> health minister, Mikhail Murashko, will self-quarantine after a member of his family tested positive for the coronavirus, an aide said on Thursday, according to the Interfax news agency.

The study&#8217;s authors concluded that the products they tested &#8220;may provide an additional level of protection against&#8221; the new coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But outside experts <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/health/covid-mouthwash.html" title="">warned against overinterpreting the study&#8217;s results</a>, which might not have practical relevance to the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 220,000 Americans. Not only did the study not investigate this deadly new virus, but it also did not test whether mouthwash affects how viruses spread from person to person.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a problem with using Listerine,&#8221; said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not an antiviral.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The study, which was published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology, looked only at a coronavirus called 229E, which causes common colds &#8212; not the new coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The researchers flooded 229E coronaviruses grown in human liver cells in the lab with several types of mouthwash and nasal rinses for 30 seconds, one minute or two minutes &#8212; longer than the typical swig or spritz into a nose or mouth. Around 90 to 99 percent of the viruses could no longer infect cells after this exposure, the study found.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But because the study didn&#8217;t recruit any human volunteers to gargle the products in question, the findings have limited value for the real world, other experts said. The human mouth, full of nooks and crannies and a slurry of chemicals secreted by a diverse cadre of cells, is far more complicated than the inside of a laboratory dish.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Researchers warn people not to misuse mouthwash or nasal rinses or ingest large quantities of the liquids, because they can be dangerous.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-j--wu" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid4-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="at-12-shes-a-covid-19-long-hauler"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#at-12-shes-a-covid-19-long-hauler">At 12, she&#8217;s a Covid-19 &#8216;long hauler.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Maggie Flannery, 12, at her home in Manhattan.

After three weeks, her parents recovered. Maggie also seemed to get better, but only briefly before suffering a relapse that left her debilitated.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It felt like an elephant sitting on my chest,&#8221; Maggie said. &#8220;It was hard to take a deep breath, I was nauseous all the time, I didn&#8217;t want to eat, I was very light-headed when I stood up or even just lying down.&#8221; She also experienced joint pain and severe fatigue.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She tested negative for both the coronavirus itself and for antibodies to it. But viral tests taken long after the initial infection are generally negative, and antibody tests are frequently inaccurate.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;They didn&#8217;t know anything about &#8216;long-Covid&#8217; at that point,&#8221; said Amy Wilson, Maggie&#8217;s mother. &#8220;They said it was anxiety. I was pretty sure that wasn&#8217;t true&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Maggie&#8217;s pediatrician, Dr. Amy DeMattia, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/well/family/coronavirus-symptoms-kids-children-long-hauler.html" title="">has since confirmed the Covid-19 diagnosis</a>, based on the child&#8217;s clinical history and the fact that both her parents tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">More than seven months into the coronavirus pandemic, it has become increasingly apparent that many patients with both severe and mild illness <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/us/coronavirus-long-term-effects.html" title="">do not fully recover</a>. Weeks and months after exposure, these Covid-19 &#8220;long-haulers,&#8221; as they have been called, continue experiencing a range of symptoms, including exhaustion, dizziness, shortness of breath and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/health/covid-survivors.html" title="">cognitive impairments</a>. Children are generally at significantly less risk than older people for serious complications and death from Covid-19, but the long-term impacts of infection on them, if any, have been especially unclear.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Although <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/well/family/caring-for-children-with-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome.html" title="">doctors recognize that a small number of children have suffered a rare inflammatory syndrome</a> shortly after infection, there is little reliable information about how many who get Covid-19 have prolonged complaints like Maggie.

In July, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/coronavirus-texas-rio-grande-valley.html" title="">ambulances lined up in a grim parade</a>, waiting to drop patients at emergency rooms.

But the game is perhaps more urgent and galvanizing in Texas than anywhere else. As towns along or near the Rio Grande have shut off their Friday night lights, or left them flickering in uncertainty, there has been a sense of cultural casualty.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In late August, the school district that includes Palmview High, La Joya High and Juarez-Lincoln High decided to cancel fall sports.

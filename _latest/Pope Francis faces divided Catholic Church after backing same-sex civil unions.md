  Pope Francis faces divided Catholic Church after backing same-sex civil unions 
description: > 
  Pope Francis' bombshell endorsement of same-sex civil unions reverberated through the Catholic world Thursday, with his comments sparking criticism but also support — including from the strongman leader of Asia’s largest Catholic nation.Still, conservative Catholic politicians have resisted legislation to recognize same-sex civil union or marriage fearing the ire of influential church leaders."The pope's statement clearly contradicts what has been the long-standing teaching of the church about same-sex unions," Tobin said in a statement.While serving as the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis opposed legislation to approve same-sex marriage, but supported legal protection for the rights of gay couples.However, he had never come out publicly in favor of same-sex civil unions as the pope.

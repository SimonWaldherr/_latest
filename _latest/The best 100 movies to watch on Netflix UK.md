<div><p>Lockdown may have eased, but as cinemas see only a slow trickle of new releases, and many stay closed until further notice, you may be searching for something to watch in the comfort of your own living-room.&#160;</p>
<p>Netflix has plenty of classic films in its catalogue, and in recent years, it has also produced some excellent content of its own, from the animal rights satire <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/okja-review-bong-joon-hos-daffy-anti-meat-monster-mash-beethoven/">Okja</a> to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2020/02/09/oscars-2020-what-time-uk-how-watch-live-academy-awards-tonight/">Oscar</a>-winning&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/roma-reviewalfonso-cuaron-returns-mexico-sweeping-heart-quickeningly/">Roma</a> and Noah Baumbach&#8217;s <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/marriage-story-review-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-splits-screwball-kramer/">Marriage Story</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>And yet,&#160;for every award-winning drama, there are just as many trashy B-movies, such as the risible romance <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/2017/12/12/netflix-fire-mocking-viewers-film-christmas-prince/">A Christmas Prince</a>.</p>
<p>If you need help navigating the&#160;murky, Sharknado-infested waters, look no further. In this star-rated guide, The Telegraph&#8217;s film critics have chosen 100&#160;of the very&#160;best.</p>
<h5><b>Spirited Away (2017)</b></h5>
<p><b>Genre: </b>Animation.<b> Dir:&#160;</b> Hayao Miyazaki.<b>&#160;Cast:&#160;</b>Rumi Hiiragi Miyu Irino, Mari Natsuki, Takeshi Naito, Yasuko Sawaguchi,&#160;Tsunehiko Kamij&#333;,&#160;Takehiko Ono and&#160;Bunta Sugawara.<b>&#160;Cert:&#160;</b>PG.&#160;<b>Time: </b>125&#160;mins.</p>
<p><b>In a nutshell:&#160;</b>Netflix recently secured the European distribution rights to Studio Ghibli&#8217;s&#160;catalogue, and it&#8217;s proving one of their most popular acquisitions in years. Ghibli enjoys an almost mythological status in&#160;Japan.&#160;Anything directed by co-founder and lead director Hayao Miyazaki possesses&#160;a generous humanity and beauty, but Spirited Away has come to epitomise the Ghibli style, with its simple pathos and enchanting blend of folktale, mysticism and modernity. It follows a girl whose parents are turned to pigs in a parallel world leading her on a quest to save them. The Odyssean reference is not to be missed; Miyazaki expertly draws out the similarities between the Western and Eastern canons.&#160;</p>

The mandatory wearing of masks in offices "will be taken into consideration" by ministers, the Housing Secretary has said.

Raising the prospect of further rules on face coverings, Robert Jenrick argued that their use in the workplace "does have some benefit".

It came as Transport for London (TfL) and the British Transport Police (BTP) officers mounted a rush-hour crackdown on public transport compliance on Thursday.

Masks were made compulsory for bar staff, shop workers, and waiters in England last month in an effort to stem the rising number of coronavirus cases. Raising the prospect of a further roll-out to include offices, Mr Jenrick said: "Some workplaces are asking their employees to do so voluntarily.

"It does have some benefit. So, I'm sure, as with other things, that will be taken into consideration by the Health Secretary and the chief medical officer, but we don't have a plan today to take action in that respect."

There have been 600,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and more than 40,000 people have died, government figures show.

However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.

New cases remain high after sharp increase

The government announced 12,872 confirmed cases on Sunday.

After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August.

On Friday, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that approximately one in 240 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 1 October. That equates to 224,000 people - approximately double the figure reported for each of the previous two weeks.

The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said it is "almost certain that the epidemic continues to grow exponentially across the country."

The official number of cases during the first peak underestimated the number of people with coronavirus, as widespread testing was not available until mid-May.

Hospital admissions vary around the UK

The latest figures show hospital admission rates for Covid-19 patients rising most quickly in the North West and the North East and Yorkshire region.

With rising Covid-19 admissions, there have been warnings that hospitals will have to cut back core services.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the UK is in a "perilous" position, and the ability of the NHS to see non-Covid patients is under threat.

Where are the current hotspots?

There are several local hotspots in the UK where cases have spiked in recent weeks.

Extra restrictions have been introduced in many areas of the UK - including across the whole of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and areas of Wales, Northern England and the Midlands.

Restrictions are expected to be further tightened in parts of England early next week, with the closure of bars and restaurants a possibility.

The Scottish government has already introduced tougher measures across the country's central region, which includes Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Daily deaths starting to rise

While daily cases are rising quite quickly now, the rise in deaths has been slower.

The government announced 65 new deaths on Sunday. Of these deaths, 62 were in England, two were in Wales and one was in Northern Ireland. No deaths were recorded in Scotland.

Three times as many people have died from Covid-19 than from flu and pneumonia in England and Wales this year, according to official figures.

Between January and August 2020, there were 48,168 deaths due to Covid-19 compared to 13,600 from pneumonia. Only 394 were due to flu.

Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.

England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been about 38,000.

Overall death toll could be more than 60,000

When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.

Government figures count people who tested positive for coronavirus and died within 28 days.

But there are two other measures.

The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been more than 57,000 deaths by 25 September.

The third method looks at all UK deaths over and above the number usually expected for the time of year - known as excess deaths. This measure shows the death toll was more than 65,000 by 25 September.

There were 10,861 deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 25 September, less than 2% above the expected level for this time of year.

It was the third week in a row that Covid-19 registered deaths had risen across the UK - a total of 234 involved coronavirus, up from a low of 83 three weeks ago. But the total is still far below the peak of 9,495 seen in April.

What is the R number in the UK?

The "R number" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.

If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.

On Friday, the government said its estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 1.2-1.5.

The estimate for England is 1.2-1.5, while for Scotland it is 1.3-1.6. The estimate for Wales is 1.3-1.6 and in Northern Ireland it is 1.5.

The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.

  Ørsted: The oil giant that went from dirty fuel to clean energy in a decade

  Despite presenting itself to the world as a haven of environmentalism, Copenhagen was hiding a dirty secret when it hosted the UN’s climate change summit in 2009.One of Denmark’s largest state-owned companies at the time was Dong Energy (now Ørsted), which was responsible for one-third of the country’s carbon dioxide emissions.Dong, or Danish Oil and Natural Gas, has existed in different forms since 1972, formed as a company to extract and sell Denmark's vast fossil fuel reserves.But by the time the UN conference rolled around in 2009, Dong had already made up its mind: it would begin a decades-long transition from dirty fuel to clean energy.But a decade later, Ørsted – as the company is now known – has a market capitalisation approaching that of oil titan BP’s.

<div><p>Despite presenting itself to the world as a haven of environmentalism, Copenhagen was hiding a dirty secret when it hosted the UN&#8217;s climate change summit in 2009.</p>
<p>One of Denmark&#8217;s largest state-owned companies at the time was Dong Energy (now &#216;rsted), which was responsible for one-third of the country&#8217;s carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>Dong, or Danish Oil and Natural Gas, has existed in different forms since 1972, formed as a company to extract and sell Denmark's vast fossil fuel reserves. But by the time the UN conference rolled around in 2009, Dong had already made up its mind: it would begin a decades-long transition from dirty fuel to clean energy.</p>
<p>Company executives have since said that the company decided on what it called an &#8216;85/15 vision&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the time, 85pc of our power and heat production was black and 15pc&#160;was green,&#8221; said Jakob Askou B&#248;ss, a senior executive at the company in charge of strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our chief executive, Anders Eldrup, said that within a generation, Dong would flip that ratio around, so that 85pc would be green and 15pc black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many scoffed at the idea, questioning whether the company would ever be profitable again. But a decade later, &#216;rsted &#8211; as the company is now known &#8211; has a market capitalisation approaching that of oil titan BP&#8217;s.</p>

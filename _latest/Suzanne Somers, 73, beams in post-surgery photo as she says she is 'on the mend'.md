Suzanne Somers had a terrible fall down a flight of stairs last week.

But now the 73-year-old actress, who is best known for her TV series Three's Company, is 'on the mend,' she said in an Instagram post from the weekend.

The blonde Seventies bombshell looked radiant in an off-the-shoulder dress as she posed with her 84-year-old husband Alan Hamel.

Better now: Suzanne Somers had a terrible fall down a flight of stairs last week. But now the 73-year-old actress is 'on the mend,' she said in an Instagram post from the weekend

She was a bright light in the 70s: The star is best known for her TV series Three's Company; seen here in 1978

The pinup had on an off-the-shoulder black dress as she beamed in the image.

Behind her was husband Alan who also looked to be in good health.

'SURPRISE!!! The family is here and we will reveal the October SUZANNE Selects Box today at 11am PT! I’m not quite camera-ready but my two favorite guys are here and Caroline made bolognese. I’m on the mend and Life is good! Join the fun!!' she said in her caption.

Also in the image was Bruce Somers Jr, the 54-year-old son of Suzanne and her first husband, Bruce Somers, who she was married to from 1965 until 1968.

Last week Suzanne let fans know she had hurt her neck requiring surgery.

The blonde beauty took a fall down a flight of stairs with her 84-year-old husband Alan Hamel and Suzanne felt the pain the most, she shared with a Wednesday Instagram post.

After seeing a doctor the pinup realized she had two vertebrae out of place and went in for an operation.

All good: 'SURPRISE!!! The family is here and we will reveal the October SUZANNE Selects Box today at 11am PT! I’m not quite camera-ready but my two favorite guys are here and Caroline made bolognese. I’m on the mend and Life is good! Join the fun!!' she said in her caption. Also in the image was Bruce Somers Jr

She explained how it went down: The personality shared the bad news with a Wednesday Instagram post

In the meantime, the couple is taking a break from their Facebook show.

Suzanne and Alan, who have been married since 1977, live in Palm Springs, California.

Somers is already recovering from a fractured hip from last year.

The TV star began: 'Thank you so much for all of your concern while Alan and I took a break from our normal schedule.'

She added: 'As most of you know, I have been struggling for the better part of the year with a fractured hip, and then Alan and I took an unfortunate fall while coming down the stairs at our home.

'I had an intense amount of pain after the fall that was not resolving – even after having tequila!'

After several scans, 'it was determined I had 2 vertebrae out of place which was causing pressure on nerves and creating that tremendous pain.'

A hit! She came to fame with John Ritter on Three's Company which debuted in 1976; Heather Lowe is far right

She said the good news was that she had neck surgery to correct the issues.

'And now I am on the mend! I need a bit more time to recover before I can join you again at the bar for our virtual cocktail parties.

'In the meantime, we will keep the sales going on our site. Watch for posts and special announcements on SuzanneSomers.com, and my accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. As always, I so appreciate your love and support. Be back soon! Love, Suzanne.'

Somers' most recent book is A New Way to Age: The Most Cutting-Edge Advances in Antiaging.

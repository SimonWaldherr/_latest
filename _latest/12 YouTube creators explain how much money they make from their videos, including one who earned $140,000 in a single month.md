This is the latest installment of Business Insider's YouTube money logs, where creators break down how much they earn.

Each month, many YouTube creators earn money off the ads that play in their videos.

Many factors — like whether a video went viral, or whether the audience that watches their content is valuable to advertisers — will determine what a creator earns per paycheck. YouTubers are paid out monthly and either receive a check by mail or direct deposit.

To start earning money from YouTube, creators must have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the past year. Once they reach that threshold, they can apply for YouTube's Partner Program. Overall, the program allows creators to start monetizing their channels through ads, subscriptions, and channel memberships.

Making money through Google-placed ads isn't the only form of revenue for these digital stars. Creators on YouTube earn their money a number of ways, from sponsorships to selling merchandise.

Still, one of their main sources of revenue is often directly from YouTube through ads. So how much do YouTubers generally make per month?

<div><p>Dozens of Success Academy charter school backers gathered at a field in Harlem to protest the city&#8217;s demand of $500,000 to use their athletic facilities on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Citing coronavirus budget cuts and maintenance costs, City Hall wants permit fees for all city schools &#8212; including traditional public schools &#8212; to use public fields for extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>The charter network has pushed back on the demand and said that city workers have shut them out of facilities that they&#8217;ve used <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/success-academy-claims-city-wants-500000-to-use-playing-fields/">without cost for years.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here because the mayor locked us out of our own fields,&#8221; said Success Academy CEO and founder Eva Moskowitz at one of the contested grounds in Harlem. &#8220;It&#8217;s illegal. He wants to charge us a half a million dollars which he is not permitted to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Success Academy said that they have been barred from using seven facilities in Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Manhattan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t even know it was happening,&#8221; Moskowitz said. &#8220;We came and the fields were locked. And we tried to get the key and they changed the locks on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The charter network said the move has halted practice for more than 300 elementary and middle school athletes in soccer, basketball, and track.</p>
<p>The fields are connected to buildings where Success Academy shares space with traditional public schools.</p>

 
	<p>The network says it sent Chancellor Richard Carranza a letter about the impasse one week ago but has yet to hear back.</p>
<p>The DOE said Monday that they hope to work towards a resolution on the matter and cited costs associated with cleaning and maintaining facilities during a budget crunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends and I love the game of soccer. We have big dreams &#8212; I want to be a pro player,&#8221; said Moussa Daho, an eighth grader at SA Harlem North Central. &#8220;I need to train to make that happen. We can&#8217;t lose an entire year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The charter school, which currently enrolls roughly 20,000 students at 47 schools, elected for a fully-remote model until next year when they will review their format.</p>

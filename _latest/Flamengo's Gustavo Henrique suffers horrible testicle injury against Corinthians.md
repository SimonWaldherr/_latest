  Flamengo's Gustavo Henrique suffers horrible testicle injury against Corinthians 
description: > 
  Flamengo defender Gustavo Henrique was left in tears on Sunday after sustaining a gruesome testicular injury against Corinthians.The 27-year-old was reportedly caught by an accidental stamp during a challenge in the first-half, with blood quickly staining his white shorts.Henrique will be hoping the nasty injury will not put him out of action for too long, with Flamengo facing league leaders Internacional on Sunday.He came through the youth academy at Santos - Neymar's former club - and made 216 first-team appearances for the club in eight years.Though never capped by the senior national team, he did make three appearances for Brazil Under-23s back in 2015.

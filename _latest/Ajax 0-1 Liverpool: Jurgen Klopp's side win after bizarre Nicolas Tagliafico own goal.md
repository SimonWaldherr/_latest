<div><p class="adHolder" id="leader_wide"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were four minutes of injury time gone when Nicolas Tagliafico lofted a ball into the Liverpool area. Adrian came out to clear it but his punch fell short to midfielder Jurgen Ekkelenkamp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a split second it looked as if there may be another late sting in the tail for Liverpool, more of the frustration felt at Everton; but Ekkelenkamp shot over, and the win was safe. A good win, too. Liverpool haven't lost to Dutch opponents since 1966, but Ajax are a useful side and certainly had their moments. An away win, and a clean sheet, in Liverpool's first match without the talismanic Virgil van Dijk is not to be sniffed it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet that little vignette at the end of the second-half told its own story. It is not just Van Dijk that Liverpool are weaker without. When Alisson does not start, they are a different team, too. Adrian, his understudy, is similar in many ways to Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana; capable of a fine save one minute, a fine mess the next. </p><img id="i-57a595599dcfcea4" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="622" width="962" alt="Liverpool celebrate after Nicolas Tagliafico's own goal in the 35th minute gave the visitors the lead in the first period" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-57a595599dcfcea4" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34678134-8863919-Liverpool_celebrate_after_Nicolas_Tagliafico_s_own_goal_gave_the-a-110_1603319642901.jpg" height="622" width="962" alt="Liverpool celebrate after Nicolas Tagliafico's own goal in the 35th minute gave the visitors the lead in the first period" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Liverpool celebrate after Nicolas Tagliafico's own goal in the 35th minute gave the visitors the lead in the first period</p><img id="i-f4cd7f04d6c7fb00" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="643" width="962" alt="Despite the lucky goal, Jurgen Klopp's side battled out an important opening European win at the Johan Cruyff Arena" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f4cd7f04d6c7fb00" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34678340-8863919-Despite_the_lucky_goal_Jurgen_Klopp_s_side_battled_out_an_import-a-106_1603319642814.jpg" height="643" width="962" alt="Despite the lucky goal, Jurgen Klopp's side battled out an important opening European win at the Johan Cruyff Arena" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Despite the lucky goal, Jurgen Klopp's side battled out an important opening European win at the Johan Cruyff Arena&#160;</p><img id="i-93643812fc310c6a" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="678" width="962" alt="Mohamed Salah found it tough on Wednesday and was substituted with 30 minutes to go but the Reds held on for the victory" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-93643812fc310c6a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34676994-8863919-Mohamed_Salah_found_it_tough_on_Wednesday_but_the_Reds_held_on_a-a-107_1603319642851.jpg" height="678" width="962" alt="Mohamed Salah found it tough on Wednesday and was substituted with 30 minutes to go but the Reds held on for the victory" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Mohamed Salah found it tough on Wednesday and was substituted with 30 minutes to go but the Reds held on for the victory</p><img id="i-6dacefebabd53145" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="678" width="962" alt="Joe Gomez looked assured playing alongside Fabinho in central defence for Liverpool, in the absence of Virgil van Dijk" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-6dacefebabd53145" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34677016-8863919-Joe_Gomez_looked_assured_playing_alongside_Fabinho_in_central_de-a-112_1603319642924.jpg" height="678" width="962" alt="Joe Gomez looked assured playing alongside Fabinho in central defence for Liverpool, in the absence of Virgil van Dijk" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Joe Gomez looked assured playing alongside Fabinho in central defence for Liverpool, in the absence of Virgil van Dijk</p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">AJAX 0-1 LIVERPOOL - MATCH FACTS&#160;&#160;</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Ajax: Onana, Mazraoui, Schuurs (Traore 84) Martinez, Tagliafico, Klaassen (Labyad 74) Blind (Huntelaar 84), Gravenberch, Neres (Ekkelenkamp 74), Tadic, Kudus (Promes 9)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Subs not used: Stekelenburg, Alvarez, Klaiber, Kotarski</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Goals: None&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bookings: Promes</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manager: Erik ten Hag&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Fabinho, Robertson, Milner (R Williams 90) Wijnaldum, Jones (Henderson 45) Salah (Jota 60) Firmino (Minamino 60), Mane (Shaqiri 60).&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Subs not used: Origi, Kelleher, Neco Williams, Jaros, Cain</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Goals: Tagliafico 35 OG</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bookings: Milner, Alexander-Arnold</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manager: Jurgen Klopp&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Referee: Felix Brych (Germany)</p> <p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_1"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>
</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In the second-half, Onana produced a good save from Takumi Minamino swiftly followed by a chaotic clearance almost charged down by Diogo Jota. Yet Onana is Ajax's number one. The players do not have a superior team-mate to compare him to, and that makes a difference.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All goalkeepers make mistakes, but some continue to inspire confidence despite it. Onana does, for Ajax. His defenders do not seem greatly skittish around him.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is different for Liverpool. Maybe because they know what they are missing. From Ajax's first attack to the last, there was a feeling a fleeting misjudgment could change this game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It did, of course, but not in a way it was imagined. The goal that divided these teams was flukey, and nothing less. As unfortunate as Liverpool were last weekend at Goodison Park so the balance was redressed in their favour in the first half here.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For all the moments of fragility that Adrian had displayed, it turned out to be a panicked defensive error by Ajax that separated the sides.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To further emphasise the good fortune, it came after 35 minutes at a time when Liverpool had barely created a chance of their own. And what a strange goal it was.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadio Mane was actually trying a shot when he took out a chunk of the arena turf with his toecap like a 24-handicapper trying a low iron from a difficult lie.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ball spun off and was actually heading out for a throw in, when it reached Tagliafico. The defender somehow got his feet mixed up and diverted it past goalkeeper Onana, into his own net.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a staggering moment, and another almost followed nine minutes later when Mane crossed and this time Perr Schuurs almost made it two. Maybe Onana's team-mates thought he was getting bored and needed occupying. Certainly Liverpool hadn't been giving him a great deal to do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this wasn't about Liverpool's forwards, but how their defence would cope without Van Dijk. And they managed. There are, of course, better sides in this competition than Ajax; teams that will test Liverpool's defence to its limit.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the good news is, this defensive group will hold firm against most. Fabinho, in particular, was impressive, filling in for the injured Joel Matip, and Andrew Robertson was outstanding, his usual marauding self. Trent Alexander-Arnold came onto a good game eventually, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet more than two months separate Liverpool from the January transfer window and Jurgen Klopp may still wish to bolster his numbers, no matter how well the residents are doing. The lack of central defenders has a knock-on effect. Fabinho was switched from his midfield role, Curtis Jones drafted in for his European debut.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At half-time the young man was replaced by Jordan Henderson as Klopp looked to hold what he had. The coach spent even more of the game than usual bellowing, whether at the officials or his own men it was hard to say, there was so much of it.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ultimately, Liverpool were good enough to hold the result, but a spark was most certainly absent.&#160;</p><img id="i-dd0bd6452ef086c0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="642" width="962" alt="Fabinho did brilliantly to acrobatically clear off the line just before half-time after Dusan Tadic lobbed Adrian on the goal-line" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-dd0bd6452ef086c0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34681278-8863919-Fabinho_does_brilliantly_to_clear_off_the_line_after_Dusan_Tadic-a-111_1603319642908.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="Fabinho did brilliantly to acrobatically clear off the line just before half-time after Dusan Tadic lobbed Adrian on the goal-line" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Fabinho did brilliantly to acrobatically clear off the line just before half-time after Dusan Tadic lobbed Adrian on the goal-line</p><img id="i-7b4fe55fb2ac5f28" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="642" width="962" alt="Gini Wijnaldum was bright throughout the whole 90 minutes as the Reds fought for their win in the rain on Wednesday night" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-7b4fe55fb2ac5f28" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34681292-8863919-Gini_Wijnaldum_was_bright_throughout_the_whole_90_minutes_as_the-a-113_1603319642927.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="Gini Wijnaldum was bright throughout the whole 90 minutes as the Reds fought for their win in the rain on Wednesday night" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Gini Wijnaldum was bright throughout the whole 90 minutes as the Reds fought for their win in the rain on Wednesday night</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the first time since 1984-85 that Liverpool have entered Europe's most prestigious tournament as English champions &#8211; they did win the league after that, but during the time of the European ban &#8211; so this result will have resonance.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rest of the tournament will take note, but it won't tell the whole story. Liverpool were solid, more than exceptional, they worked hard, and overcame obstacles; they did not dazzle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed they led pretty much against the balance of play, and despite looking rather fragile at the back early on. In moments, Adrian is unconvincing and when he got into a terrible mix-up with Joe Gomez after just two minutes it revealed the assuredness Liverpool have lost.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gomez was shepherding the ball back and clearly wanted Adrian to stay home to receive the pressure-alleviating pass.&#160;</p><img id="i-22ae3b718789e07e" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="642" width="962" alt="Captain Jordan Henderson was a substitute at half-time and was influential throughout the second half as the Reds held on" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-22ae3b718789e07e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34681286-8863919-Jordan_Henderson_was_a_substitute_at_half_time_and_was_influenti-a-114_1603319642931.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="Captain Jordan Henderson was a substitute at half-time and was influential throughout the second half as the Reds held on" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Captain Jordan Henderson was a substitute at half-time and was influential throughout the second half as the Reds held on</p><img id="i-9359fdd7b4db5290" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="646" width="962" alt="Brazilian midfielder Fabinho once again looked very impressive in his unusual role of centre back for Jurgen Klopp's side" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-9359fdd7b4db5290" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34681276-8863919-Fabinho_once_again_looked_very_impressive_in_his_unusual_role_of-a-115_1603319642933.jpg" height="646" width="962" alt="Brazilian midfielder Fabinho once again looked very impressive in his unusual role of centre back for Jurgen Klopp's side" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Brazilian midfielder Fabinho once again looked very impressive in his unusual role of centre back for Jurgen Klopp's side</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adrian had other ideas and came haring out, trying to make a substantial hoofed clearance upfield with Gomez in the way. The ball ricocheted out for a throw-in.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were other moments of vulnerability. In the 15th minute, Adrian dawdled too long over a clearance and saw it charged down by Dusan Tadic &#8211; fortuitously spinning away from goal rather than towards it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At other times, he came to the rescue. Everyone needs to be on their guard when Tadic is around and the former Southampton man was at the heart of much that was good about Ajax, as usual. It was his cross after 16 minutes that set up Lisandro Martinez at the far post, but the Argentinian's header was snaffled by Adrian.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quincy Promes, on as a substitute for the luckless Mohammed Kudus &#8211; who suffered a ninth minute knee injury, landing awkwardly after a challenge from Fabinho &#8211; teed up Ryan Gravenberch in the 21st minute, his shot travelling just wide.&#160;</p><img id="i-393f40f6b2a677c0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="642" width="962" alt="Tagliafico simply couldn't sort his feet out at the back post as the ball cruelly spun off him into the net past Andre Onana" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-393f40f6b2a677c0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34681312-8863919-Tagliafico_simply_couldn_t_sort_his_feet_out_at_the_back_post_as-a-108_1603319642888.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="Tagliafico simply couldn't sort his feet out at the back post as the ball cruelly spun off him into the net past Andre Onana" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Tagliafico simply couldn't sort his feet out at the back post as the ball cruelly spun off him into the net past Andre Onana</p><img id="i-787501fa2ca21dcf" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="745" width="962" alt="Ajax skipper Tadic tries to dribble away from Reds right back Trent Alexander-Arnold in the first-half on Wednesday night" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-787501fa2ca21dcf" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34681282-8863919-Tadic_tries_to_dribble_away_from_Trent_Alexander_Arnold_in_the_f-a-117_1603319642935.jpg" height="745" width="962" alt="Ajax skipper Tadic tries to dribble away from Reds right back Trent Alexander-Arnold in the first-half on Wednesday night" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Ajax skipper Tadic tries to dribble away from Reds right back Trent Alexander-Arnold in the first-half on Wednesday night</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And soon after when Promes combined with David Neres in a succession of neat passes, Adrian saved smartly from close range.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ajax came closest either side of half-time, when Fabinho's alertness proved invaluable. It was Tadic again, put through one on one, and lobbing Adrian beautifully. Somehow, though, Fabinho got there first, looping the ball away inches from the line with a spectacular overhead kick. It was the sort of bold, responsible defending we have come to expect from Van Dijk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What happened at the start of the second half, however, was more luck than judgment. Davy Klaassen, late of Merseyside's blue half, struck a shot which defeated Adrian but not the outside of the post. Just as well, really. Liverpool have suffered enough at the hands of Evertonians these last few days.&#160;</p><img id="i-6672dd2009948a5c" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="654" width="962" alt="Jordan Henderson and manager Jurgen Klopp embrace after the crucial Champions League victory on matchday one" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-6672dd2009948a5c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34681288-8863919-Jordan_Henderson_and_Jurgen_Klopp_embrace_after_the_crucial_Cham-a-109_1603319642890.jpg" height="654" width="962" alt="Jordan Henderson and manager Jurgen Klopp embrace after the crucial Champions League victory on matchday one" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Jordan Henderson and manager Jurgen Klopp embrace after the crucial Champions League victory on matchday one&#160;&#160;</p><img id="i-47562db34766c124" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="582" width="962" alt="Reds No 2 goalkeeper Adrian kept a clean sheet in Amsterdam on Wednesday, deputising for the injured Alisson Becker" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-47562db34766c124" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/23/34681280-8863919-Reds_No_2_goalkeeper_Adrian_kept_a_clean_sheet_in_Amsterdam_on_W-m-118_1603320373047.jpg" height="582" width="962" alt="Reds No 2 goalkeeper Adrian kept a clean sheet in Amsterdam on Wednesday, deputising for the injured Alisson Becker" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Reds No 2 goalkeeper Adrian kept a clean sheet in Amsterdam on Wednesday, deputising for the injured Alisson Becker&#160;</p></div>

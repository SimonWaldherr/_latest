There is a soundbite that accompanies every draft special WWE has produced for the last decade in which Vince McMahon exclaims, "it's time to shake things up again!"

That is all good and well when that actually happens. Friday night, though, was not one of those times.

WWE held a draft that saw some faces make a jump to the opposing show, some stay put, but nothing really changed.

Seth Rollins was the biggest acquisition of night one, heading to SmackDown. While that should have been a huge coup for the blue brand and a major opportunity for the Messiah to freshen things up after six years spent on the flagship, it was undone later in the night when Rey and Dominik Mysterio were drafted to Friday nights.

Why is that relative to Rollins? Because they have spent the last four months feuding and working with each other every single week on Raw. They have been inseparable, making for repetitive and tired television. It is no accident that they ended up on the same show, where they are almost certain to work with each other on the grander stage that network television presents.

Add to that unwelcome development so many draft picks that remained put, far more than those who switched shows, and you have less of a shakeup than much ado about nothing.

It is disappointing, too, because the draft is one of the most eagerly anticipated elements of WWE television every year and really could have helped create a spark in a product that has largely been stagnant here in 2020.

President Donald Trump said lung scans taken during his time at Walter Reed Medical Center showed he had some "congestion" in his lungs following his COVID-19 diagnosis.

The president appeared on Fox News Friday, saying he underwent lung scans while he stayed at the hospital last week after he tested positive for the coronavirus.

"They tested the lungs ... with different machinery ..., and it tested good," he said. "Initially, I think they had some congestion in there, but ultimately it tested good, and with each day it got better, and I think that's why they wanted me to stay frankly."

President Donald Trump revealed details into his bout with COVID-19, saying he had some "congestion" in his lungs while he was hospitalized at Walter Reed Medical Center.

The president appeared in an interview Friday with Fox News' Dr. Marc Siegel during Tucker Carlson's show. Siegel, a physician and professor of medicine at New York University, has mostly praised the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The president said he underwent lung scans while he stayed at the hospital last week after he tested positive for the coronavirus.

"They tested the lungs ... with different machinery ..., and it tested good," Trump said. "Initially, I think they had some congestion in there, but ultimately it tested good, and with each day it got better, and I think that's why they wanted me to stay frankly."

White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said scans taken at the hospital showed "expected findings but nothing of any major clinical concern," he said in a statement, but failed to clarify what those findings were.

Trump tested positive for the virus last week, and stayed at Walter Reed for several days to undergo testing and treatment for the coronavirus. He returned to the White House earlier this week, but he has yet to release results of a test showing he no longer has the virus.

Asked by the doctor on Fox News if he had been tested again for the virus he said: "I have been re-tested and I haven't even found out the numbers or anything yet, but I've been re-tested and I know I'm at either the bottom of the scale or free."

When asked on Fox News if he knew how he contracted the virus, the president said he didn't know.

"I don't know, they had some big events at the White House. Perhaps there. I don't really know. Nobody really knows. Numerous people have contracted it."

Trump said during the Fox News interview that he is not currently on any medication for COVID-19 "as of eight hours ago."

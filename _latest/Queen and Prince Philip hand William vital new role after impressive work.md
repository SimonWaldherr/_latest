 <p>     </p> <p>He replied: "I think to be perfectly honest I&#8217;m struggling to keep the optimism levels going with my own children, and that&#8217;s really kind of like a self&#8230; an understanding moment where you kind of look at yourself and go 'am I doing enough on this?'</p> <p>"Are we really at this stage in life when I can&#8217;t be hugely optimistic and pleased that my children are getting so into nature, because you kind of worry and dread they&#8217;re soon going to realise that we are in a very, very dangerous and difficult time in the environment and that as a parent, you feel you&#8217;re letting them down immediately.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>"So, having watched so many David Attenborough documentaries recently with my children, they absolutely love them, the most recent one &#8211; the extinction one &#8211; actually George and I had to turn it off, we got so sad about it halfway through.</p> <p>"He said to me you know I don&#8217;t want to watch this anymore, why has it come to this and you know he&#8217;s seven years old and he&#8217;s asking me these questions already, he really feels, it and I think every 7-year-old out there can relate to that.</p> <p>"So, I really feel from an emotional point of view as well I think every parent, everyone wants to do the best for their children, and I think we have to have a decade of change, a decade of repairing the planet so that we can hand it on to the next generation and future generations and sustain the prosperity for their lives too."</p></div>

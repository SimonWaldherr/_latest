In the Ghanaian town of Krobo Odumase, the Partey family used to wake up early and head for the mountains. Led by Jacob, the father of five children, they would run to the hills in the mornings, building their strength and working on their technique with whatever tools they could find.

The oldest of the five siblings was Thomas, who knew from a young age what he wanted to do with his life. “My father wanted me to be a professional,” he says. “It was always about football. He would go out with us in the early mornings to run to the mountains. We would be jumping, heading leaves and all those things. He was my first coach.”

Partey Snr clearly knew what he was doing. He worked closely with Thomas (who also has three half-siblings on his mother’s side) and nurtured a player who has since grown into one of the finest midfielders in the European game. The journey that started under the trees and on the hills of Krobo Odumase now continues at Arsenal, where Partey arrived for £45 million last week.

He does not need to be told that expectations are high. At Arsenal they have long craved a midfielder of Partey’s technical and physical qualities, and the hope in north London is that the former Atletico Madrid player is ready to transform Mikel Arteta’s side into a more combative, competitive unit.

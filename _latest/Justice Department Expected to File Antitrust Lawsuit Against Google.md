It will accuse Google of spending billions of dollars from advertisers to pay phone manufacturers, including Apple, to make sure that Google is the default search engine on phone browsers.</p><p>The lawsuit will also focus on the fact that Google's search application is pre-loaded and cannot be deleted from phones running its Android operating system. The government will allege that the company illegally prohibits other search applications from being preloaded onto phones, according to reports. </p><p>Google controls some 80% of search queries in the U.S., officials will reportedly say. The company has previously denied accusations that it illegally maintains a monopoly and is expected to harness its significant cash reserves to fight the lawsuit, which could stretch on for years. Alphabet has battled similar lawsuits in Europe, where it has been fined billions of dollars. </p><p>The legal action follows a year-long investigation by the Justice Department that comes amid criticism and scrutiny from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as President Donald Trump, who are wary of the dominance of tech giants like Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon &#8211; though sometimes for different reasons. </p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">The Week in Cartoons: Oct. 19-23</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/dc615be/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Ff9%2F22%2F0b7ab3a341e293e2d5944b8bb25a%2Fmrz101820dapc.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>The lawsuit comes days after the publication of a House Judiciary subcommittee report on big tech's market dominance.

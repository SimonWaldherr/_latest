  The billionaire cofounder of Shopify says he intentionally slowed the company's growth — and it was the key to managing the 'crushing' stress of being a CEO 
description: > 
  Shopify CEO and cofounder Tobias Lütke has one word to describe the responsibility of being a chief executive: "crushing."And [there's] the state of complete dread and 'we're dead, we're dead, we're dead tonight.'"To deal with it, Lütke intentionally prevented the e-commerce platform from growing as quickly as it could have between 2009 and 2010, he told NPR."If you come from [an] engineering [background], you know that something's always a bottleneck, and then the moment you remove that, something else becomes a bottleneck — and the same goes for companies," Lütke told NPR."The bottoms are deep, and the implications of what failure means — it just means so much," Lütke told NPR.

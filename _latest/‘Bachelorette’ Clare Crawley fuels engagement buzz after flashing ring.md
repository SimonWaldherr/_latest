<p>Over the weekend, &#8220;Bachelorette&#8221; Clare Crawley walked through her hometown of Sacramento, Calif., sporting what appeared to be an engagement ring.</p>
<p>Dressed in all black from head-to-toe, Crawley, 39, and her dazzling accessory appeared to enjoy the afternoon outing, one week after her season of &#8220;The Bachelorette&#8221; premiered on ABC.</p>
<p>A longtime Bachelor Nation star, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/03/the-bachelorette-twist-two-female-stars-in-season-16/?_ga=2.182259111.1064371662.1603023695-408226937.1554312161">Crawley is rumored</a> to have cut her &#8220;Bachelorette&#8221; journey short after falling for contestant Dale Moss, a former NFL football player. <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/13/bachelorette-recap-season-16-episode-1/?_ga=2.175599266.1064371662.1603023695-408226937.1554312161">In the first episode</a>, Crawley said she got the &#8220;feels&#8221; after encountering 32-year-old Moss for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely feel like I just met my husband, I&#8217;m shaking,&#8221; Crawley said at the time.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Moss received the coveted first impression rose from Crawley.</p>
<p>Although it remains to be seen how <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/01/bachelorette-allegedly-kept-clare-crawley-for-big-twist-exit/?_ga=2.182259111.1064371662.1603023695-408226937.1554312161">Crawley&#8217;s much-speculated exit</a> will play out on-air &#8212; spoiler alert: host Chris Harrison says she&#8217;s &#8220;blown up &#8216;The Bachelorette'&#8221; &#8212; the hairstylist <a href="https://www.etonline.com/bachelorette-clare-crawley-on-her-electric-connection-with-dale-and-if-shes-engaged-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did tell &#8220;Entertainment Tonight&#8221;</a> in a recent interview that she&#8217;s &#8220;happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy,&#8221; she said, remaining coy about her current relationship status.</p>

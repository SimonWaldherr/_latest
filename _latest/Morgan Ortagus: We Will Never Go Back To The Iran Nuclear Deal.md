<p>"I can tell you that we will never go back into that deal. What President Trump and Mike Pompeo have said is that we want to negotiate for a new and better deal.  
We know that the former Iran deal, that deal did did it actually provided a path for Iranians to get the nuclear weapon. It just delayed it. It was going to take time, but it was essentially kicking the can down to another for another administration to deal with. Also, crucially, one of the big problems with the deal your listeners have probably heard us talk about the fact that Iran got billions of dollars in sanctions relief. It's not just about them getting the money. It's really about what did they do with the money. Right. That's what matters. So if they had gotten the money and said we are going to build roads, schools, public health infrastructure and did all these things to start behaving normally, it would be different. But they didn't. What did they do? They use that money to fund their terrorist groups throughout the region. Iran remains the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism. And so they're giving weapons and munitions and aid to terrorist groups around the region which are attacking Saudi Arabia, attacking all of our interests. And so you have to you have to ask yourself, well, why does that matter? It matters because we just gave the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism billions of dollars to fund more terrorism. Call me crazy, I don't think that's very logical."</p>

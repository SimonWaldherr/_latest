The streets of Paris and eight other French cities fell silent last night as police enforced a 9pm curfew aimed at stemming the surge in coronavirus infections.

Twenty million French people - about a third of the population - are now under the 9pm to 6am curfew.

Most people stayed at home rather than risking a €135 (£122) fine for breaching the controversial curfew, which began on Saturday and will remain in force for at least a month. About 12,000 police officers have been assigned to patrol the streets.

Dog-walkers and people travelling to work or seeking medical treatment are allowed out, but must carry a signed declaration explaining their reason.

The fast-moving 2020 MLB postseason train has arrived at its penultimate stop, with the American League Championship Series and National League Championship Series unfolding this week.

The Tampa Bay Rays survived Game 5 against the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series to advance to the ALCS for just the second time in franchise history. They won Game 1 on Sunday against the Houston Astros, who went 29-31 during the regular season but have upended the Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics so far.

On the National League side, the Los Angeles Dodgers are in the NLCS for the fourth time in five years but are still searching for their first World Series title since 1988. The Atlanta Braves stand in their way, and with the pieces falling into place in the starting rotation, the NL East champs are dangerous.

As we look ahead to another exciting week of postseason baseball, this week's Monday morning power rankings will take a deeper dive into those four teams by ranking their respective bullpens, starting pitching rotations and offenses.

Two best-of-seven series with zero off days promise to provide plenty of drama as the final four teams look to punch their tickets to the World Series.

description: > 
  So again we say: go and form your European Premier League, see if we care.Bayern Munich versus Barcelona, or Barcelona versus Bayern Munich?Real Madrid versus Juventus, or Juventus versus Real Madrid?But if they can find some way of hurting the Premier League - by devaluing its market share - then they will thrive.That is why the Premier League was so keen to deliver it.

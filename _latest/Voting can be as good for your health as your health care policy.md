<div><p class="endmarkEnabled">Health care will be on voters' minds as they cast their ballots in the next two weeks: Nearly 6 in 10 said the issue was "a very big problem," according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/national-problems-topline.pdf" target="_blank">the Pew </a><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/national-problems-topline.pdf" target="_blank">Research Center in June</a>, and <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2020/" target="_blank">the Kaiser Family Foundation found in September</a> that 30 percent of Americans identified either the coronavirus or health care as the most important issue in this election.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">There are likely a number of reasons why.

Mass protests have swept the nation, millions are out of work and natural disasters from floods to fires have destroyed homes and caused mass evacuations.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">And then there's the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Many people are concerned about leaving their homes, much less congregating with hundreds of their fellow Americans at polling places. According to a recent Healthline survey, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wsav.com/news/your-local-election-hq/how-to-stay-safe-while-voting-in-person-this-election-season/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!8hxNshKzW7yXGnaN9RSfekgamkCeraVHYV8l7zZhVjV2DxgbSUhb-DO0wMtji287UIXx%24" target="_blank">68 percent</a> of Americans are afraid they'll get exposed to Covid-19 if they vote in person.</p><p></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Voting can be done safely during this pandemic: Plan your vote by knowing where to cast your ballot and how much time it will take, where to park and whether you'll need to stand in line. If so, you might want to take a bottle of water and a snack. Wear a mask, keep 6 feet away from others and carry hand sanitizer. If you can vote early or via absentee ballot, do so.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">But vote. It can be a balm for all of today's uncertainty.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">A wealth of research confirms that acts of civic engagement such as voting, volunteering and charitable giving deliver significant mental and physical health gains across all age groups.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">A Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-21685-006__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!8hxNshKzW7yXGnaN9RSfekgamkCeraVHYV8l7zZhVjV2DxgbSUhb-DO0wMtjiwPmEVy9%24" target="_blank">study</a> found that in adults over 50, those who volunteered 200 hours or more in the previous year were less likely to develop high blood pressure and reported greater increases in psychological well being.</p><p class="opinary-widget-embed"></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Higher levels of civic engagement make the entire population healthier &#8212; not just individuals.

Humans are social creatures, so we naturally want to feel like responsible members of a group, according to <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-money-and-your-heart/201210/how-voting-contributes-your-overall-well-being__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!8hxNshKzW7yXGnaN9RSfekgamkCeraVHYV8l7zZhVjV2DxgbSUhb-DO0wMtji5lcD_RX%24" target="_blank">Michal Ann Strahilevitz</a>, a professor at St. Mary's College in California.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"Voting is a form of civic engagement that allows individuals the opportunity to be part of something greater than ourselves," Dr. Timothy J. Legg, a medical advisor to Healthline, told me.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">That's why people in households who are told they'll receive public praise for voting are nearly 5 percent more likely to cast a ballot, according to a <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9114-0__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!8hxNshKzW7yXGnaN9RSfekgamkCeraVHYV8l7zZhVjV2DxgbSUhb-DO0wMtji0vTa76w%24" target="_blank">Fordham University study</a>. The same study found that publishing the names of all eligible, nonregistered voters in the local newspaper also increased turnout.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Just think about the "I voted" stickers that are ubiquitous on Election Day: Usually, adults find it silly to adorn themselves in stickers, yet millions of Americans are already proudly wearing their stickers this year, thanks to the rise of early voting and absentee balloting. Many are even displaying the icon on their videoconference backgrounds. This little symbol offers public proof that the bearer is a good citizen.

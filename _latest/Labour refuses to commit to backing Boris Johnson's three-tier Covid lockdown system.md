Boris Johnson is "several steps behind the curve and running to catch up" Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday as he refused to commit Labour MPs to supporting his new three-tier scheme to tackle coronavirus.

Sir Keir, the Labour leader, was responding to the new strategy for local lockdowns which the Prime Minister said would inform the "appropriate interventions" needed to tackle coronavirus cases in each area.

He listed the previous occasions on which Mr Johnson had announced measures to tackle the virus which had failed to dent the rising numbers of cases, adding: "Those measures have not worked – we wouldn't be here if they had."

Refusing to back Mr Johnson's plans, the Labour leader said: "The question is whether the restrictions announced by the Prime Minister can bring the country back from the brink, whether they can regain control of the virus or provide support and confidence that local businesses need.

"We will consider the package – we will look at the small print of the Prime Minister's statement, we will discuss them with local Mayors, councillors and leaders in the areas most affected – and we will scrutinise the economic package that sits alongside them.

"But I have to say to the Prime Minister that I am now deeply sceptical that the Government has actually got a plan to get control of this virus, to protect jobs or regain public trust.

"We tried to give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt, but it increasingly feels like the Prime Minister is several steps behind the curve and running to catch up with a virus that he has lost control of long ago."

Mr Johnson replied that while Sir Keir was happy to criticise the Government's response to Covid, "he won't say what he would do – he won't say how he will get the virus down without those kind of restrictions".

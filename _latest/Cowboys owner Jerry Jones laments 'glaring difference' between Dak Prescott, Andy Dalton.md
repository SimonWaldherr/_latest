  Cowboys owner Jerry Jones laments 'glaring difference' between Dak Prescott, Andy Dalton 
description: > 
  This wasn’t the team that scored 24 unanswered fourth-quarter points against the Cleveland Browns.“That was the pretty glaring difference out there last night,” Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday morning on Dallas radio station 105.3 The Fan, referencing his team's 38-10 loss.“We can get the most out of our team and it could be enough with Andy Dalton,” Jones said.I wish we had been in better shape protection-wise there, I wish we had a better run game and could get in better field position and better points in the game to work with.Jones also steered clear of bashing defensive coordinator Mike Nolan, whose unit has allowed a league-worst 36.3 points per game.

The scenery was familiar to this year's team.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But this time was different.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">No more was this the team that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2020/09/20/dallas-cowboys-atlanta-falcons-score-dak-prescott-ezekiel-elliott/5846758002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">rallied from a 20-point deficit against the Falcons</a> to escape with a 40-39 win. Nor was this the team that trailed by 15 in Seattle in the third quarter yet managed to lead briefly in the fourth before <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2020/09/27/dallas-cowboys-seattle-seahawks-score-russell-wilson-dak-prescott/3557334001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">falling short in the final minutes</a>. This wasn&#8217;t the team that scored 24 unanswered fourth-quarter points against the Cleveland Browns.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This team no longer has Dak Prescott.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;That was the pretty glaring difference out there last night,&#8221;&#160;Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday morning&#160;on Dallas radio station 105.3 The Fan, referencing his team's <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2020/10/19/dallas-cowboys-arizona-cardinals-score-ezekiel-elliott-andy-dalton/5987240002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">38-10 loss</a>. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t have to stay that way.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Prescott was far from perfect before he<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2020/10/11/dak-prescott-injury-cowboys-qb-carted-off-after-hurting-leg/5963463002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> suffered a season-ending compound fracture and dislocation of his ankle</a> in the third quarter of a Week 5 win over the Giants. He&#160;threw four interceptions and lost three fumbles in five weeks, an uncharacteristic trend of ball insecurity for a player who recorded a 23:4 touchdown-to-interception ratio as a rookie.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But Prescott threw for at least 450 yards three times in four-and-a-half games. He scored three rushing touchdowns in the second half against the Falcons en route to the win. The magic fell short at times, but tight end Dalton Schultz said and teammates echoed: With Prescott in the huddle, &#8220;we know we&#8217;re never out of the fight.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Monday night, the Cowboys were out. They failed to score a touchdown until the final 3 minutes of the loss after scoring at least 30 points in their four previous&#160;games. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2020/10/19/dallas-cowboys-ezekiel-elliott-fumbles-mike-mccarthy-andy-dalton/5988270002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Ezekiel Elliott fumbled twice in the first half</a>, prompting a brief benching. Quarterback Andy Dalton threw two interceptions, with additional passes bouncing&#160;off&#160;Arizona defenders&#8217; hands. The Cardinals scored 24 points off the four giveaways that further entrenched the Cowboys' turnover rate as the&#160;worst of any team in the league. Dallas&#160;didn&#8217;t answer.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We can get the most out of our team and it could be enough with Andy Dalton,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t last night. He contributed to the turnovers early. We had a play that could have been a turnover right off that would&#8217;ve been significant. But we can get there with Andy.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;He&#8217;s going to be challenged. I wish we had been in better shape protection-wise there, I wish we had a better run game and could get in better field position and better points in the game to work with.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;When Dak had those things, we did well. Dak was able to take us when we didn&#8217;t have those things and keep us in the ball game and get a couple wins.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Dalton completed 34 of 54 passes for 266 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It&#8217;s one of those things where everybody has to look at themselves," he said. "I&#8217;ve got to be better and I&#8217;ve got to do a better job out there of giving our guys chances."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">NFL POWER RANKINGS:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/nate-davis/2020/10/20/nfl-power-rankings-week-6-seahawks-packers-steelers-titans/5987579002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Packers' meltdown leads to another change at No. 1</a></p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Arizona Cardinals linebacker Dennis Gardeck (45) tries to tackle Dallas Cowboys quarterback Andy Dalton (14) in the end zone in the first quarter at AT&amp;T Stadium."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jones declined to criticize coaching as the Cowboys fell to 2-4 in the Mike McCarthy debut season, instead touting the coach's &#8220;outstanding experience&#8221; rallying teams from adversity during 13 years in Green Bay.

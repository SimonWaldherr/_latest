<h3>Areas 'may be put into Tier 3 as preventative measure' <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf1102"> </a></h3>
<p>Areas could be placed into Tier 3 lockdown as a preventative measure&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf1103">before they have met threshold triggers</a>, the director general of the Joint Biosecurity Centre has said. Dr Clare Gardiner said talks with council leaders and local directors of public health to introduce "prophylactic action" to stop case numbers rising were ongoing. Giving evidence to the science and technology select committee, Dr Gardiner said decisions about imposing tougher restrictions were largely down to "professional judgments" rather than "hard thresholds". It comes as ministers came under fire from the Opposition benches and some of their own MPs over the Government's approach to local lockdowns.&#160;<strong>Camilla Tominey&#160;</strong>analyses how the Government&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf1104">is turning what should be Tory victories into spectacular own goals</a>. Yet, given the huge furore surrounding Manchester's move to Tier 3,&#160;<strong>Madeline Grant</strong>&#160;sketches how Prime Minister&#8217;s Questions&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf1105">was more like a tea party than a bloodbath</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a bid to protect the most vulnerable from the virus, staff will be&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf1106">banned from working in more than one care home</a>&#160;in an attempt to halt the spread.&#160;The Telegraph&#160;understands the Government is drawing up legislation that will make it illegal for care homes to employ staff working at multiple sites. It follows concerns repeatedly expressed by Government scientists that outbreaks within the sector are "seeding" infections across whole communities, with agency workers singled out. With cases rising and hospitals filling up, it is tempting to worry the UK is heading for a second wave as deadly as the first. Yet&#160;<strong>Sarah Knapton</strong>&#160;analyses how data from intensive care units&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf1107">shows that is not the case</a>.</p>
<h3>Trump lawyer Giuliani caught in Borat film 'gotcha'</h3>
<p>Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump&#8217;s personal lawyer and former New York mayor, has been&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf1108">caught in a compromising situation</a>&#160;with a young actress while unsuspectingly being filmed for the latest Borat film. Mr Giuliani was invited to a hotel in Manhattan in July by a member of comedian and director Sacha Baron Cohen's team posing as a Russian reporter who said she wanted to talk about the president's coronavirus handling.&#160;<strong>Josie Ensor&#160;</strong><a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf1109">describes what happened</a>. It comes as Barack Obama&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf110a">unleashed a fierce attack</a>&#160;on Mr Trump during his first in-person appearance on the campaign trail, mocking the US president's tweeting of conspiracy theories, and dismissing his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is not the ideal preparation for the President for tonight's final TV debate. Here is a&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf110b">guide to the event</a>&#160;and receive analysis and updates with&#160;The Telegraph&#8217;s&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf110c">US election WhatsApp group</a>.</p>
<h3>Sir Paul McCartney completes 50-year album trilogy</h3>
<p>Many of us resolved to tackle those jobs in lockdown that had fallen to the bottom of the to-do list. In the case of Sir Paul McCartney, it was to&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf110d">finish a trilogy of albums that he began half a century ago</a>. Sir Paul has revealed he has made McCartney III, 50 years after the release of his first self-titled solo album and 40 years after McCartney II. As with the two earlier records, he plays every instrument - guitar, piano, bass, drums and more - and has written and produced every song. Sir Paul explains&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf110e">what provided his inspiration</a>&#160;and&#160;<strong>Neil McCormick</strong>&#160;sets out why the album&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6f9f68d8,39d16525,36bf110f">will prove a worthy match for Adele and Ariana Grande</a>.</p>

  Mercedes Schlapp: Biden won't answer on court packing -- but Dems appear to draw inspiration from socialists 
description: > 
  The Supreme Court is on the minds of American voters right now – Biden must give a straight answer.If you think that’s farfetched, just look at another country that packed their Supreme Court – socialist Venezuela.Sixteen years after Chavez's Supreme Court expansion, the Democratic Party led by Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, which has increasingly embraced socialism, shares a similar objective.They are openly calling to pack the Supreme Court as retribution for Judge Barrett’s nomination and eventual confirmation.It was for this reason that Justice Ginsburg herself strongly urged against packing the Supreme Court.

  Facebook suspends account of Ukrainian politician working with Giuliani 
description: > 
  Facebook has suspended the account of the Ukrainian politician Andrii Derkach, who has been accused by the U.S. government of being a Russian agent and trying to meddle in the presidential election.“We removed this account and this Page for violating our policy against the use of our platform by people engaged in election-focused influence operations,” Facebook said in a statement Monday.Since the 2016 election, Facebook and other tech companies have stepped up their efforts to try to prevent election meddling, especially by foreign agents.Giuliani told MSNBC last month that he was unaware Derkach was a Russian agent.“I don’t know what’s in the Treasury Department investigation, nor have I ever seen any evidence that he [Derkach] is or is not a Russian agent,” Giuliani said.

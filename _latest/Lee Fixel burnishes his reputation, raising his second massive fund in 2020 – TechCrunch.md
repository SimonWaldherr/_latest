<div><p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, former Tiger Global Management investor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/lee-fixel" target="_blank">Lee Fixel </a> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1828125/000182812520000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">registered plans</a> for the second fund of his new investment firm, <a href="https://addition.com/">Addition</a>, just four months after closing the first. But investors who were shut out of that $1.3 billion debut fund and who might have hoped to write a check this time around are already too late.</p>
<p>According to the Financial Times, that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ba8c63ad-b84b-46a1-a3ea-9bfe34103d06">ship has sailed</a>. Fixel has already secured a fresh $1.4 billion in capital commitments for the second fund, which Addition reportedly doesn&#8217;t plan to begin investing until next year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obviously a lot of money to raise in a very short amount of time, even in today&#8217;s go-go market, and will surely help cement Fixel&#8217;s reputation as a prized dealmaker, one whose reluctance to talk on the record with media outlets seems only to add to his mystique. (Forbes published a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/07/01/lee-fixel-raises-1-billion-fund-addition/#4338fc8719a1">lengthy piece</a> about Fixel this summer, in which Fixel seems to have provided just one public statement, confirming the close of Addition&#8217;s first fund and adding little else. &#8220;We are excited to partner with visionary entrepreneurs, and with our 15-year fund duration, we have the patience to support our portfolio companies on their journey to build impactful and enduring businesses,&#8221; it read.)</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>According to Forbes, that first fund &#8212; which Fixel is actively putting to work right now &#8212; intends to invest one-third of its capital in early-stage startups and two-thirds in growth-stage opportunities.</p>
<p>Whether that includes some of the special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, that are coming together right and left, isn&#8217;t yet known, though one imagines these might appeal to Fixel, who has longed seemed to be at the forefront of new trends impacting growth-stage companies in particular. (A growing number of SPACs is right now looking to transform some of the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">many hundreds</a> of richly valued private companies in the world into public companies.)</p>
<p>Clearer is that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/addition-e278" target="_blank">Addition </a> is wasting little time in writing some big checks. Among its announced deals is Inshorts, a seven-year-old, New Delhi, India-based popular news aggregation app that last week unveiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/lee-fixels-addition-leads-35-million-investment-in-india-inshorts-public-social-network/">$35 million </a>new funding led by Fixel.</p>
<p>The deal represents Addition&#8217;s first India-based bet, even while Fixel knows both the country and the startup well. He previously invested in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/news-in-shorts" target="_blank">Inshorts </a> on behalf of Tiger; he&#8217;s also credited for snatching up a big stake in Flipkart on behalf of Tiger, a move that reportedly produced $3.5 billion in profits when Flipkart sold to Walmart.</p>
<p>Addition also led a $200 million round last month in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snyk" target="_blank">Snyk, </a> a five-year-old, London-based startup that helps companies securely use open-source code. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/snyk-bags-another-200m-at-2-6b-valuation-9-months-after-last-raise/">more than twice the valuation</a> it was assigned when it raised its previous round ten months ago.</p>
<p>And in August, Addition led a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2020/08/25/lyra-health-hits-11-billion-valuation-as-coronavirus-boosts-need-for-teletherapy/#3665eba56938">$110 million</a> Series D round for Lyra Health, a five-year-old, Burlingame, Ca.-based provider of mental health care benefits for employers that was founded by former Facebook CFO David Ebersman.</p>
<p>A smaller check went to Temporal, a year-old, Seattle-based startup that is building an open-source, stateful microservices orchestration platform. Last week, the company announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/temporal-raises-18-75m-for-its-microservices-orchestration-platform/">$18.75 million</a> in Series A funding led by Sequoia Capital, but Addition also joined the round, having been an earlier investor in the company.</p>
<p>According to Pitchbook data, Addition has made at least <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/investor/327363-13#overview">17 investments</a> altogether.</p>
<p>Fixel &#8212; whose bets while at Tiger include Peloton and Spotify &#8212; isn&#8217;t running Addition single-handedly, though according to Forbes, he is the single &#8220;key man&#8221; around which the firm revolves, as well as the biggest investor in Addition&#8217;s first fund.</p>
<p>He has also brought aboard least three investment principals from Wall Street and a head of data science who worked formerly for Uber (per Forbes). Ward Breeze, a longtime attorney who worked formerly in the emerging companies practice of Gunderson Dettmer, is also working with Fixel at Addition.</p>

  PSG vs Manchester United player ratings: David de Gea impresses as United earn Champions League win 
description: > 
  Manchester United surprised a lacklustre Paris Saint-Germain to earn a 2-1 win in the Champions League on Tuesday night.United missed several chances to add a second on the counter-attack, with Marcus Rashford spurning one chance in particular.Good when able to get forward, putting in a few crosses and having a chance to score himself.Fortunate to get another chance with his penalty, but his all-round game was very good in the first half.Should have taken on one chance he tried to pass and skied another chance - then won the match late on.

Furious his penalty save didn&#8217;t count. Two good saves in the second half.</p><p>Alessandro Florenzi - 5. Absolutely nothing offered going forward and didn&#8217;t exactly shut down his flank defensively either.</p><p>Abdou Diallo - 6. Clumsy with clearances and challenges. Good recovery run before half-time to thwart Rashford.</p><p>Presnel Kimpembe - 5. Bit of a shambles for the captain. Missed some big tackles and headers.</p><p>Lavin Kurzawa - 7. Good when able to get forward, putting in a few crosses and having a chance to score himself. Defended well too for the most part.</p><p id="taboola-carousel-thumbnails"></p><p>Idrissa Gueye - 5. Very passive on the ball and not his usual destructive self against the opposition counters. Subbed at the break.</p><p>Danilo Pereira - 7. Easily his side&#8217;s best midfielder, which wasn&#8217;t saying much. Great tracking back to tackle Rashford in the second half.</p><p>Ander Herrera - 5. Ineffective with most parts of his game other than wild shots and winning a few free-kicks.</p><p>Angel Di Maria - 5. One good effort which tested De Gea. Mostly ran into blind alleys and overhit set-pieces.</p><p></p><p>Kylian Mbappe - 7. His team&#8217;s best attacker, but it always seemed to have to be individual moments. Twice denied after good runs.</p><p>Neymar - 6. Lots of tricks, but often in deep areas. Grew more frustrated and less effective.</p><p>Man United scored from the spot</p><p class="sc-pRFZy iIPyzR copyright">(AFP via Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Manchester United</strong></p><p>David de Gea - 8. Made two very good saves and was generally strong with his handling.</p><p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 7. Lots of big tackles to shut out the left-wing threat of PSG.</p><p>Victor Lindelof - 6. A few clearances but probably the quietest of United&#8217;s back line, more relying on positional intelligence than needing to make the big challenges.</p><p></p><p>Axel Tuanzebe - 7. The chance he has been waiting so long for this year and certainly proved his worth on the night. Twice ousted Mbappe with pace and power.</p><p>Luke Shaw - 7. Quietly impressive as the left-centre defender.&#160;</p><p>Alex Telles - 7. Decent enough debut, some good set-pieces. Much more to come from him.</p><p>Scott McTominay - 8. Nothing flashy, everything effective. Won the ball, blocked the runs, cut out the passes.</p><p>Fred - 6. Hard-working but probably lost the ball as many times as he won it back.</p><p>Bruno Fernandes - 7. Fortunate to get another chance with his penalty, but his all-round game was very good in the first half. Less influential after the break.</p><p>Marcus Rashford - 7. Movement was ten out of ten, end product was about a five. Should have taken on one chance he tried to pass and skied another chance - then won the match late on.</p><p></p><p>Anthony Martial - 6. Good skill to win the penalty but little other positive impact. Unfortunate with the own goal.</p><p class="sc-ptCms fzKffT"></p></div>

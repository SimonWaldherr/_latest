New Tier 2 coronavirus restrictions will “decimate” pubs and the hospitality industry in the absence of extra support, industry leaders have warned Matt Hancock.

Tier 2 rules which state that households cannot mix indoors in any setting will be in place in London, Essex, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness and North-East Derbyshire from tomorrow.

Peter Ducker, the chief executive at the Institute of Hospitality, told The Telegraph the restrictions are “not viable at all” and “the worst of all possible worlds.”

“We do need to see support because perfectly good businesses that are viable in a normal world just won’t be able to sustain,” he said.

“Surely the Government doesn’t want to see that happen.

“It will certainly spell the end for a number of hospitality businesses and create great hardship and distress for a lot of people.”

Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said the tighter measures will leave "most pubs fighting for their very survival".

“Tier 2 measures mean pubs can remain open, but households cannot mix inside them,” she said, adding that such premises will not be eligible for any additional Government support.

There has so far been no decision on moving Greater Manchester to Tier 3 after a frosty call between regional leaders and Downing Street resulted in an impasse.

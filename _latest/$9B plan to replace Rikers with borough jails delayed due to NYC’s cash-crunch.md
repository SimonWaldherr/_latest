<div><p>The city&#8217;s COVID-19 budget crisis has caused the de Blasio administration to push back plans to replace Rikers Island &#160;&#8212; and may mean that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/17/city-council-approves-deal-to-close-rikers-build-4-smaller-jails/">four smaller jails</a> will never get built.</p>
<p>The $8.7 billion scheme for new jails in every borough except Staten Island, was scheduled to be done by <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/17/city-council-approves-deal-to-close-rikers-build-4-smaller-jails/">the fall of 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Now they won&#8217;t be completed until August 2027, according to a City Planning Commission presentation given by administration officials Monday.</p>
<p>De Blasio and many of the City Council members who approved the new jails plan last year will be term-limited out of office by 2022&#8211; years away from the revised completion date.</p>
<p>De Blasio has already cut spending for the massive plan by $500&#8201;million in this year&#8217;s budget, and pushed costs into 2029, prompting <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/27/bill-de-blasios-replace-rikers-plan-is-falling-completely-apart/">the council&#8217;s finance director</a> to note, &#8220;Continued delays of these projects into years beyond the current administration decrease the chances of these jails being built.&#8221;</p>
<p>News of the new timeline <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/10/19/21524219/manhattan-jail-tombs-replace-rikers-delayed-nyc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was first reported</a> by the media outlet The City.</p>
<p>The closure of Rikers Island depends on a continuing shrinking of the jail population at a time when <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/02/current-nycs-murder-tally-just-surpassed-all-of-2019-nypd-data/">some categories of crime</a> including murder are rising in the city.</p>
<p>The de Blasio administration also facing three lawsuits over the new jail locations, including one <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/27/bill-de-blasios-replace-rikers-plan-is-falling-completely-apart/">recently green lighted</a> by a Manhattan judge who found government officials hadn&#8217;t completed required reviews for a replacement facility at 125 White St. Two other suits are pending in The Bronx and Queens.</p>
<p>Still the Dept. of Correction is moving ahead with plans to demolish and rebuild the current Manhattan Detention Facility known colloquially as &#8216;The Tombs&#8217; at 125 White St with a smaller lockup. The notorious downtown slammer <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/09/officials-unveil-plan-to-close-the-tombs-jail-on-rikers-island/">is scheduled to close</a> by the end of November.</p>
<p>&#8220;The city&#8217;s commitment to closing the jails on Rikers Island has not wavered,&#8221; Colby Hamilton, a spokesman for the Mayor&#8217;s Office of Criminal Justice, told The Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;The updated schedule reflects the ongoing dynamics forced on the city by the COVID-19 pandemic. The completion of new, modern facilities closer to communities and families will remain within the 10-year time frame established by Mayor Bill de Blasio. We will continue working diligently to achieve this goal shared by New Yorkers,&#8221; Hamilton said.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;The impact of the updated schedule on the borough-based jail project&#160;cost remains under review.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former New York state Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman, who led a panel that recommended closing Rikers and replacing it with smaller lockups across the city, blasted the delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unacceptable for the city to further delay closing the jails on Rikers,&#8221; Lippman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The events of 2020 &#8211; from the pandemic to the economic crisis to a sharpened focus on racial equity &#8211; have made the need to shut down institutions of racial injustice like Rikers more, not less urgent,&#8221; Lippman said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Council Speaker Corey Johnson said, &#8220;Closing Rikers Island remains a high priority for the City Council, and we are committed to making this a reality.&#8221;</p>

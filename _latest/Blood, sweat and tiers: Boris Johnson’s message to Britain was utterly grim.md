Mr Johnson, however, didn’t seem to share Mr Fabricant’s confidence. All he would say was that he had “little doubt” that by spring the country would be “in a very different environment”. (Let’s hope he meant a better one.)

Perhaps bitter experience has discouraged him from making big promises. In July, he gave a speech in which he looked forward to “a more significant return to normality by November”. Maybe in hindsight he has glumly decided that that speech was more than optimistic; it was rash – or even reckless.

Later he held a news conference. A woman in Chesterfield wanted to know what hope there was of a normal family Christmas.

“That is going to depend, I’m afraid, on our ability to get this virus down,” sighed Mr Johnson. Obeying the new rules was essential “if we’re going to allow anything like a normal Christmas”. In other words: if you want it, it’s up to you to earn it.

He repeated that he didn’t want a full lockdown. That, of course, is no guarantee that he won’t impose one.

“We don’t want to go down that extreme route,” he said, “right now.”

Those final two words hung ominously in the air.

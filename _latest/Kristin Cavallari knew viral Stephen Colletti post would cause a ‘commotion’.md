<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/08/04/laguna-beach-exes-kristin-cavallari-stephen-colletti-reunite/">Reflecting on a certain Instagram shot</a> shared in August &#8212; in which she cozied up to former &#8220;Laguna Beach&#8221; love Stephen Colletti &#8212; the Uncommon James founder, 33, anticipated an influx of responses, she just underestimated how much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it was going to create a little commotion, I didn&#8217;t know to what degree,&#8221; Cavallari said on Monday&#8217;s installment <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bleav-presents-on-the-list-with-brett-gursky/id1442147220?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of the &#8220;On The List with Brett Gursky&#8221; podcast</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my most-liked photo on Instagram ever. More than my kids. More than anything in my life. That photo with Stephen,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I mean, I think it&#8217;s really neat that people are still so invested and it really takes people back to that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavallari and Colletti, 34, first graced audiences with their presence in 2004 as original cast members on MTV&#8217;s &#8220;Laguna Beach.&#8221; The pair was entangled in a love triangle with Lauren Conrad during the show&#8217;s first two seasons. Today, however, Cavallari said she and Conrad, 34, are &#8220;totally fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Stephen, I&#8217;ve always loved Stephen, and clearly, you know, 15 years later we&#8217;re still really good friends,&#8221; Cavallari also said on the podcast. &#8220;But no, I brought my kids to Laguna Beach, I saw a lot of people, I didn&#8217;t just see Stephen &#8230; So it was a really fun trip, but that&#8217;s all there is to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the wake of <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/04/26/kristin-cavallari-jay-cutler-break-up-after-10-years-together/">her April split from husband Jay Cutler</a>, 37, Cavallari is focusing on her family life, namely the couple&#8217;s three children: sons Camden, 8, Jaxon, 6, and 5-year-old daughter Saylor.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s sad when you close a chapter of your life and Jay and I were together for 10 years and we have three kids together. I will always love Jay in some capacity and so it&#8217;s tough,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As for dating, although Cavallari <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/12/kristin-cavallari-spotted-kissing-jeff-dye-after-jay-cutler-split/">was recently linked</a> to comedian Jeff Dye, the reality star said she is &#8220;not ready to jump into a relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing right now. I&#8217;m going through a divorce, obviously. I&#8217;m putting myself first. I mean, my kids will always be first, but beyond my kids, I&#8217;m making myself a priority right now,&#8221; Cavallari said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything &#8230; I&#8217;m not ready to jump into a relationship, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m taking care of me and I&#8217;m figuring out ultimately what I&#8217;m going to want in life, and I&#8217;m going through the motions and the process of figuring that all out.&#8221;</p>

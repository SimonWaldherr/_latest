When John Lennon was gunned down outside his New York apartment on the night of 8 December 1980, the world mourned the death of one of the twentieth century’s cultural icons. The blizzard of shocked eulogising that followed inevitably focused on Lennon’s past as a Beatle.

But the attention on the musician’s legacy eclipsed a tantalising fact: Lennon was just months away from embarking on what could have been one of the most ambitious tours in rock history. The 40-year-old’s ‘One World, One People’ tour was shaping up to be a futuristic extravaganza that was years ahead of its time.

With uncanny prescience given how concerts have evolved in the decades since, Lennon envisaged a tour using holograms and giant video screens. His avant-garde stage was to resemble a colossal crab with roving claws onto which were attached video cameras to relay images back to the screens. The singer was also considering pay-per-view screenings to cater for the 1980s’ burgeoning cable TV audience. Six years before David Bowie took his Glass Spider around the world and 11 years before U2 unleashed their postmodern multimedia Zoo TV Tour, the Liverpudlian had imagined the template.

Plans for the tour – which would have seen Lennon play live for the first time in over six years – were cruelly thwarted by assassin Mark Chapman’s bullets. But details of the ambitious production are laid bare in a new book John Lennon 1980: The Last Days in the Life, released this week to coincide with what would have been the singer’s 80th birthday.

In the book, Lennon’s producer and then-bandmates give glimpses of a tour that could have been one of the most jaw-dropping live events of the new decade, a decade in which modern rock concerts cemented their form and became the multimillion dollar money-spinners they are today.

<div><p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a new streaming service in France called <a href="https://www.salto.fr">Salto</a>. The companies behind the new service have been around for a while though. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salto" target="_blank">Salto </a> is a joint initiative between TF1, France T&#233;l&#233;visions and M6 &#8212; three major TV networks.</p>
<p>Those companies already had their own apps with live TV and ad-supported catch-up content. And of course, you can access content from these networks from your set-top box. But they&#8217;re trying something new with Salto.</p>
<p>For now, Salto is mostly an ad-free combination of all the individual apps from TF1, France T&#233;l&#233;visions and M6. You can watch live TV from 19 different channels. You can play catch-up content from all three networks without any video ad.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>It costs &#8364;6.99 per month. For &#8364;9.99, you can watch on two screens simultaneously. For &#8364;12.99 per month, you get four screens. Salto has released apps for Android, Android TV, iOS and tvOS. It also works in a web browser.</p>
<p>Such an offering probably won&#8217;t be enough to attract subscribers. That&#8217;s why Salto is slowly adding exclusive content to its platform as well. Salto is also going to be a good way to access content for kids in a dedicated section.</p>
<p>You can see some TV shows before they air on TV, such as an adaption from Agatha Christies&#8217; &#8216;And Then There Were None&#8217;, the new season of Fargo. There are also some classic shows, such as Parks &amp; Recreation and Seinfeld.</p>
<p>Who will be subscribing to Salto then? If you mostly watch live TV and you already know how to access catch-up content, Salto isn&#8217;t for you. If you already have access to premium content through a Canal+ subscription for instance, Salto isn&#8217;t for you.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re addicted to reality TV and daily soap operas, Salto could be a nice service to consume your favorite show. If you don&#8217;t pay for any streaming service, it could be a cheap service to get started and access some basic shows and movies.</p>

As unemployment climbs in the world’s wealthiest economies, demand from consumers is likely to drop with a potentially huge knock-on effect to the world’s developing countries. As their exports fall and foreign currency earnings diminish, combined with reduced overseas remittances as migrant workers find jobs more scarce, we may well see mounting debt problems that could have a domino effect and create another wave of global financial instability. Another more basic problem is hunger, with fears we could see a global health emergency turn into a humanitarian one. The number of people facing food insecurity is projected to double due to the coronavirus pandemic with Latin America being hardest hit, followed by west and central Africa. New export restrictions coupled with diminished harvests may add to the more than 100 million people undernourished in the world.

The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that for every one per cent increase in hunger, there is a two per cent increase in migration, so problems will not be contained within the borders of those countries affected. As David Beasley, the WFP’s executive director, put it “until the day we have a medical vaccine, food is the best vaccine against chaos”.

It is astonishing how little political debate there has been about the huge global problems created by the pandemic and the lack of urgency with which they are being met. There are a number of potential reasons for this – but there is also a much more fundamental, and more painful, question to be faced. How much of the global economic situation is created by the pandemic itself and how much is created by our response to it?

So far, there have been around a million Covid-related deaths worldwide, each a personal tragedy, but recent World Health Organisation estimates suggest that between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths occur annually from influenza with other recent studies putting that figure at an even higher level.

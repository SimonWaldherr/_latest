<div><p><a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/thanh-le/">Thanh Le</a> is on the doorstep of greatness as he prepares to step back inside the Circle.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese-American powerhouse will challenge ONE Featherweight World Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/martin-nguyen/">Martin &#8220;The Situ-Asian&#8221; Nguyen</a> for the gold at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/inside-the-matrix/">ONE: INSIDE THE MATRIX</a> on Friday, 30 October, in Singapore.</p>
<p>And after three consecutive knockout victories, Le is adamant that this World Championship contest won&#8217;t see the judges&#8217; scorecards.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a chess match, and you&#8217;re going to see some fireworks eventually, whether it&#8217;s 10 seconds into the fight, or five, 10, 15 minutes &#8211; whatever the case may be. Somebody&#8217;s going to sleep,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The finish is going to be up to Martin and how he approaches me. If he decides to step into my range and test my power, then it could be a short fight.&#8221;</p>
<p class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"></p>
<p>That statement is not Le boasting, but rather a fact based on his <a href="https://www.onefc.com/category/mixed-martial-arts/">mixed martial arts</a> career.</p>
<p>He holds an 11-2 professional record with a perfect 100 percent finishing rate. What&#8217;s more, ten of those victories have come via knockout.</p>
<p>Those numbers are even more impressive when you consider that Le has faced top-notch competition since making his ONE Championship debut in May 2019.</p>
<p>First, he overcame a rocky opening stanza to knock out <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/yusup-saadulaev/">Yusup &#8220;Maestro&#8221; Saadulaev</a>. Next, he captivated audiences with back-to-back first-round finishes over former ONE Lightweight World Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/kotetsu-boku/">Kotetsu &#8220;No Face&#8221; Boku</a> and Shooto Pacific Rim Featherweight Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/ryogo-takahashi/">Ryogo &#8220;Kaitai&#8221; Takahashi</a>.</p>

 

<p>Those impressive wins earned Le a shot at Nguyen. And even while the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic forced many fighters out of their usual routines, the top contender was able to maintain his focus in Louisiana, United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, we didn&#8217;t skip much of a beat at all with training because I keep such a tight-knit group. I train at a small gym, and I had my guys come into my gym,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been business as usual. I&#8217;ve had a little less of a chance to bring guys in and go travel and train, but since ONE was comfortable with setting a date and an event location, I was then able to travel, train, and bring guys in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I continued to train, develop my skills, and be the best me possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Le will need to be at his best to lift the ONE Featherweight World Title from Nguyen&#8217;s waist.</p>
<p>The highly decorated Sanford MMA star became a household name when he knocked out <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/marat-gafurov/">Marat &#8220;Cobra&#8221; Gafurov</a> to win the featherweight belt in August 2017 and then knocked out then-ONE Lightweight World Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/eduard-folayang/">Eduard &#8220;Landslide&#8221; Folayang</a> three months later to become the first-ever two-division ONE World Champion.</p>
<p>And just like Le, Nguyen is also a devastating finisher. He holds a 13-3 professional record with a 92 percent finishing rate and nine victories coming by KO.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Situ-Asian&#8221; has continued his dominance in recent outings, with his last two fights resulting in memorable finishes over former featherweight titleholder <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/narantungalag-jadambaa/">Narantungalag &#8220;Tungaa&#8221; Jadambaa</a> and the division&#8217;s #2-ranked contender, <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/koyomi-matsushima/">Koyomi &#8220;Moushigo&#8221; Matsushima</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin has power in his right hand. When he hits people, they know it. He&#8217;s got great experience and has been the champion for a long time. He&#8217;s a big draw, and he deserves to be,&#8221; Le says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin&#8217;s a smart guy, and he&#8217;s the champion for a reason. I think he&#8217;s going to come out, calculate some things, and collect information, and we&#8217;re going to be back-and-forth for a while until one of us breaks discipline.&#8221;</p>

<p>The World Title bout is allotted five rounds, but Le reiterated that he doesn&#8217;t plan on going the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going out there and losing by decision. It&#8217;s just not going to happen,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go out there, put all my cards on the table, press the issue, and make sure I get this W.&#8221;</p>
<p>That mindset is not only due to Le&#8217;s exciting, aggressive style. It&#8217;s also because he wants to push himself beyond perceived limits and test his skills against the very best in the business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only reason I do this sport is to prove to myself and my family that I&#8217;m one of the best fighters in the world, and I belong here. I belong at the top of that list as the World Champion,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to find an easy route to get [this belt] wrapped around my waist. I&#8217;m trying to fight the best guys in the world, and Martin is the best in the world. That&#8217;s why I want to fight this man.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-200164" src="https://cdn.onefc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Thanh-Le-at-ONE-A-NEW-TOMORROW-DC-1948.jpg" alt="American mixed martial arts fighter Thanh Le gets ready to step into the cage" width="1920" height="1280"></p>
<p>Of course, Le still plans to be careful. He&#8217;ll stick with his strategy and wait for his adversary to make a mistake.</p>
<p>At that point, the Vietnamese-American will have only one goal in mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Martin finally reaches, I&#8217;m going to knock him out,&#8221; Le says. &#8220;Just like I&#8217;ve been doing during my entire ONE career.&#8221;</p>

Terrifying video shows a Utah hiker being stalked by a mountain lion after the man stumbled on her cubs.

“Oh, f–k!’’ Kyle Burgess says on the camera footage as he realizes the mother wild cat is starting to follow him and he begins to film her while trying to hurry back down a trail in Slate Canyon near Provo on Saturday, according to local KUTV.

Breathing heavily — while futilely trying to scare the cougar with weak roars — Burgess stumbles along the gravel path shouting at the cat, “Please go away!

“I’m big and scary!” the man says — as the cat raises itself on its hind legs at times and bares its teeth and claws at him.

“You’re a good little kitty,’’ Burgess says — before muttering again, “Holy sh-t! Holy sh-t!

“Where’s my gun?’’ he adds in exasperation. “OK, this is where I f–king die.’’

After a torturous 6 minutes, the mountain lion finally decides she’s done toying with the hiker and stops following him.

Burgess posted the footage on YouTube and Instagram, writing on the former, “I found what I thought were bobcats on the trail during a run.

“Turns out they were cougar cubs and their mother was not happy to see me. She follows me for over six minutes acting very aggressive while I walk backwards up the trail.”

                                              YouTube creator Austin Evans got an early look at the next-gen Xbox earlier this year, seen above.

                                    <p>As previously noted, Quick Resume keeps several of your most recent games and apps running, accessible from wherever you left off. It's an evolution of a function that only worked for one game at a time on the Xbox One. And it can be amazing!</p><p>Quick Resume works for several games at once, and includes games from previous generations as well as new games made for next-gen consoles. The rules of how this functionality works, however, can be mysterious. There's no "Available for Quick Resume" menu to show you the currently running games, but there's no warning if you're about to shut down a game that's suspended to load a new one. It's the kind of stuff that Microsoft figured out ages ago on Windows, but still seemingly can't get right on a home game console.</p><p>These issues are outliers, no doubt, but they are issues nonetheless. Thankfully, every one of them &#8212; save for the size of the console, of course &#8212; could be addressed in software updates to the console in the years to come.</p><p>Of note: The Xbox Series X console I've been using was provided by Microsoft, and it's running non-final software. It has received several software updates in the past two weeks, and is likely to receive more updates between now and the November 10 launch.</p><p><strong>Got a tip?</strong>&#160;Contact Business Insider senior correspondent Ben Gilbert via email (<a href="mailto:bgilbert@businessinsider.com">bgilbert@businessinsider.com</a>),&#160;or Twitter DM (<a href="https://twitter.com/RealBenGilbert">@realbengilbert</a>).

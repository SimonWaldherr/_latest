Clay&#8217;s two World Series rings, championships he earned serving primarily as a bench player on the 1999 and 2000 New York Yankees.</p><p>&#8220;Not really,&#8221; Clay said when asked if his son has inquired about how to win a championship. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t play a whole lot. I was more a defensive substitute later, pinch-running, that kind of stuff. I didn&#8217;t get four or five at-bats every single game. I was more of a cheerleader.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p></p><p>In <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2020-10-18/dodgers-braves-nlcs-game-7-world-series-mlb-season">Sunday&#8217;s Game 7</a> of the National League Championship Series, Cody&#8217;s role was the exact opposite. When he came to the plate in the seventh inning for his fourth at-bat, the score was tied. The pennant hung in the balance.</p><p>Then he hammered a ball that will long live in Dodgers history, a go-ahead and eventual game-winning solo home run that helped send his team back to the World Series for the third time in four years &#8212; and moved him one step closer to finally matching his dad&#8217;s championship status.</p><p>&#8220;Cody is as talented as any player in baseball,&#8221; Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said following the team&#8217;s <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2020-10-18/dodgers-braves-nlcs-game-7-world-series-mlb-season">4-3 win over the Atlanta Braves</a>, sending them to a Fall Classic matchup with the Tampa Bay Rays. &#8220;But I think this postseason has shown him: He&#8217;s learned really the value of controlling the strike zone, taking what they give you, trying to win pitches, and if there&#8217;s a walk in there, take the walk. If they make a mistake, you can still slug.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>That&#8217;s exactly what happened during Bellinger&#8217;s series-deciding at-bat, a heavyweight bout against sinkerball-spinning reliever Chris Martin that lasted eight rounds. Martin landed the first blow in the righty-lefty matchup with a cutter that grazed the outer half of the strike zone. Bellinger battled back by laying off a couple sinkers away, then watched another cutter paint the outside edge.</p><p>Martin&#8217;s plan was clear: Where other pitchers attack the big-swinging Bellinger up-and-in, Martin was trying to set him up away.</p><p>&#8220;Bellinger just hasn&#8217;t shown the ability to stay off that [up-and-in] pitch,&#8221; said Fox broadcaster and MLB Hall of Famer John Smoltz, who was on the losing end of that 1999 World Series as a pitcher for the Braves. &#8220;But the strength of Martin, and the call that [catcher Travis] d&#8217;Arnaud has, is staying away.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what the battery did on two of the next three pitches, an arm-side sinker and cutter Bellinger fouled away. Sandwiched between those pitches was an inside sinker Bellinger fought off as well.</p><p>And on pitch No. 8, D&#8217;Arnaud positioned his glove in the upper corner again, wanting to mix up locations once more. The ball never got there. Martin&#8217;s 94-mph sinker stayed over the heart of the plate. Bellinger crushed it 400 feet.</p><p>&#8220;I tried to have the same approach,&#8221; Bellinger said during a Fox television interview, having flied out in another eight-pitch at-bat against Martin in Game 6. &#8220;Tried to stay within myself right there, and with two strikes, I was in battle mode and got a pitch I could hit. I knew right away it felt pretty good.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>The 2020 regular season was one of frustration for Bellinger. The reigning NL MVP struggled to figure out his mechanics and approach while collecting career-lows in batting average (.239), on-base-plus-slugging (.789) and OPS+ (113, meaning he was only 13% better than the average hitter).</p><p>His 30 walks, however, ranked second on the team &#8212; a sign to both his manager and his dad that his struggles would be only temporary, that he could still put himself in a position to punish mistakes.</p><p>In the playoffs, he is batting .250 with an OPS of .911. His 10 RBIs are second-most on the team behind only Corey Seager. On Sunday, he became the first player to hit home runs in multiple NLCS Game 7s, one-upping his blast against the Milwaukee Brewers from 2017.</p><p>&#8220;Most of the season, he was seeing it well,&#8221; Clay said. &#8220;He just couldn&#8217;t figure it out mechanically-wise. And then he finally made an adjustment &#8230; and started doing pretty well ever since then.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p></p><p>Added Roberts: &#8220;The surface-line average might not speak to how good he&#8217;s been. But spoiling pitches, the amount of pitches he&#8217;s seen, taking walks, has been considerably better than he was this [regular] season. And that&#8217;s just, credit goes to him.&#8221;</p><p>Bellinger&#8217;s next chance for redemption will come in this week&#8217;s World Series &#8212; a stage on which he struggled in 2017 and 2018, hitting a combined five-for-44 (.114) in 12 games with five RBIs, one home run, one walk and 23 strikeouts.</p><p>Those numbers weren&#8217;t weighing on his mind Sunday night though. He celebrated his home run with a pose-striking bat flip and arm-banging celebration with Kik&#233; Hern&#225;ndez that popped out his right shoulder (&#8220;I had to go back into the trainer&#8217;s room and they popped it back in so I could go out and play defense,&#8221; he said). He wore a constant smile during the postgame trophy celebration. He was a franchise hero once again. This time, he hopes there will be a ring to go along with it.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gonna be a great series,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna enjoy this and then go and try to bring that trophy home.&#8221;</p></div>

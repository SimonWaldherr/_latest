A woman in a wedding dress was caught on camera storming into a Las Vegas Target and demanding that her fiance - a store employee - marry her on the spot or she'd break up with him.

TikTok user @boymom_ashley posted a two-part video Friday, showing the determined bride-to-be as she marches through the store aisles, searching for her unsuspecting fiance.

She is accompanied by a man in dark clothes and what appears to be a bridesmaid, judging by her frock, the bouquet she's holding and her arm-swinging determination as she keeps pace with the 'bridezilla.'

By Part 2 of the video, the woman - who was not named - has tracked down her fiance, who was in the midst of restocking a shelf.

'You put this ring on my finger two years ago and it's time to do it or get out,' she tells her red shirted-finance.

She goes on to tell him that she's brought a pastor and Emily, her bridesmaid, and that if he doesn't marry her 'this second,' she's 'done' and 'out.'

When the bride spots the crowd watching her antics, she greets them and says that she's just making her fiance 'commit' or she's dumping him.

Eventually the finance asks if they can continue the conversation outside and the bride agrees, noting to the camera that she's 'shaking.'

As the fiance walks past the camera, it sounds like he says: 'Could someone had told me then?'

Unfortunately there is no Part 3, showing whether the bride is now a married woman or a single lady.

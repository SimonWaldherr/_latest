  Everything goes right for Dodgers in rout over Rays in Game 1 of World Series 
description: > 
  It was the smallest crowd at a World Series game -- highest of this "bubble" postseason -- since Game 6 of the 1909 World Series between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Detroit Tigers, with Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb as the featured stars.Betts, acquired in February in a trade from the Red Sox, became the first player to ever hit a homer, steal two bases and score two runs in a World Series game.He joined Ruth as the only players in World Series history to steal two bases and draw a walk in the same inning.All that will be remembered is this gorgeous night of his life, particularly if it culminates with a World Series title.“To be able to win a World Series after all this would be just as special as any other one for sure.”Follow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale

He permitted two hits and a run with eight strikeouts in six innings.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Rays were helpless&#160;against him. Kershaw, with his slider biting as well as it ever has in his career, retired 17 of the last 18 batters he faced. The Rays swung and missed 19 times against him, with the 50% strikeout rate the highest in any start of his career.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Betts, the gift that keeps on giving from the Boston Red Sox, brought back bitter, painful memories of trading away Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Cody Bellinger rounds the bases after a two-run home run in the fourth inning."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Betts, acquired in February in a trade from the Red Sox, became the first player to ever hit a homer, steal two bases and score two runs in a World Series game. He joined Ruth as the only players in World Series history to steal two bases and draw a walk in the same inning.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We&#8217;re here to win, man,&#8221; Betts said. &#8220;You can tell. You can tell.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And there was Bellinger, who was last seen <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/playoffs/2020/10/18/dodgers-braves-nlcs-game-7-mlb-playoffs/3707698001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">hitting a game-winning home run in Game 7 of the NLCS</a> over the Atlanta Braves, and mildly separating his shoulder in excitement with a forearm bash with Kike Hernandez in the dugout.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Bellinger, who told the doctors he wasn&#8217;t interested in a brace, let alone even tape, stepped up to the plate and in the fourth inning and calmly ripped Tyler Glasnow&#8217;s 98-mph fastball into the right-field seats. Bellinger pointed to the Dodgers&#8217; fans in the stands, waved to his parents, and when he crossed home plate, reminded his teammates about his shoulder.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">So, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/10/20/cody-bellinger-dodgers-celebration-home-run-world-series-rays/6001026002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">he played footsie in the celebration</a>, tapping his foot with each of his teammates, keeping his shoulder to his side, and laughing along the way.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It was that kind of night for the Dodgers, who showed why they are the most talented team in baseball, and have three more victories to prove it for their first championship since 1988.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>BELLINGER:&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/10/20/cody-bellinger-dodgers-celebration-home-run-world-series-rays/6001026002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Dodgers star learned his lesson from celebration injury</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>FREE TACOS:</strong>&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/10/20/mookie-betts-taco-bell-stolen-base-world-series/6001318002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">World Series stolen base means Taco Bell for all</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Yet, even with all of the heroes on stage, this night belonged to Kershaw, putting on his most dominant postseason performance of his career, in front of his friends and family near his hometown of Dallas.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Kershaw, the greatest pitcher of his generation with his three Cy Young awards and career 2.43 ERA, has been relegated to almost ordinariness in the postseason. He had made 35 postseason appearances, and 28 starts, but was just 11-12 with a 4.31 ERA, and a gruesome 1-2 with a 5.40 ERA in five World Series appearances.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And then, along came this night, the 10th Game 1 postseason start of his career. He had been just 4-5 with a 5.86 ERA in the previous nine starts, with the Dodgers losing three of his last four starts in 2017 and 2018.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">No matter. All that will be remembered is this gorgeous night of his life, particularly if it culminates with a World Series title.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Winning the World Series is going to be special,&#8217;&#8217; Kershaw said. &#8220;I was throwing simulated games in May, June, July, wondering if we were even going to be playing.

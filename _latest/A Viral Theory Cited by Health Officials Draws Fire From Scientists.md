  A Viral Theory Cited by Health Officials Draws Fire From Scientists

  Even Dr. Fauci has suggested that another national lockdown must be instituted only as a last resort.“This has been wrongly framed as a debate between lockdown and no lockdown,” said Dr. Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London.Dr. David Nabarro, a special envoy to the World Health Organization, has urged governments not to resort to lockdowns as the primary method to control the virus.But the lockdowns in the spring were necessary, he added, as emergency measures to give countries time to put in place strategies to control the virus.“There is a middle way,” Dr. Nabarro added, between strict lockdowns and letting the virus freely infect people.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Among scientists, too, there is near-universal agreement that lockdowns are harmful. Even Dr. Fauci has suggested that another national lockdown must be instituted only as a last resort.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But mostly, scientific disagreement centers on whether lockdowns are a necessary move when other strategies to contain the virus have not even been put in place, or have failed.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;This has been wrongly framed as a debate between lockdown and no lockdown,&#8221; said Dr. Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Dr. David Nabarro, a special envoy to the World Health Organization, has urged governments not to resort to lockdowns as the primary method to control the virus.

They say that governments should never have imposed lockdowns at all, and never should have tried to institute coronavirus testing and contact-tracing. Instead, the trillions of dollars in economic aid approved by Congress should have been spent on programs to protect those at highest risk of illness and death.</p></div>

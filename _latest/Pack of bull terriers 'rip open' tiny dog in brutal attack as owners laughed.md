 <p>     </p> <p>Alliah Akam, 24, who is Milo&#8217;s owner and Tina&#8217;s daughter, said: &#8220;My mum tried to pick up the two tiny dogs but she was knocked over by the dog which ran off with Milo, shaking it and savaging it.</p> <p>&#8220;It ripped Milo&#8217;s jaw open, pierced its lungs and chest. It only stopped when it thought he was dead.</p> <p>&#8220;My mum was on the floor. She fell when the dog jumped at her and broke her little finger and has cuts to her face.&#8221;</p> <p>After attacking Milo, the dog then turned its attention towards Coco who &#8220;luckily&#8221; only suffered bruises but was left shaken after being picked up by the attacking dog.</p>

   <p>Alliah says the three males just stood and watched the horror unfold as her mum began screaming for help.</p> <p>&#8220;They just walked away,&#8221; said Alliah, &#8220;having witnessed my mum in floods of tears and screaming, then told her to shut up.&#8221;</p> <p>A nearby resident heard Tina&#8217;s screams and rushed out with a towel to wrap up Milo and Coco, who were taken to Kingston Vets to be checked over.</p> <p>Alliah says Milo is currently in a critical condition and is unsure whether or not he is going to pull through.</p> <p>She said: &#8220;I am concerned for my dog worrying if he is going to pull through or not. My mum is in a state of distress. She just wants to know if he is going to make it.&#8221;</p>

 <p>     </p> <p>Alliah says that she felt sorry for the six dogs and that the fault for the attack is on their owners and claims there have been &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of similar attacks on rabbits and cats.</p> <p>She has also called the police to inform them of the attack.</p> <p>&#8220;I feel sorry for their dogs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the dog or its breed itself it is how they have been brought up.</p> <p>&#8220;I think the police need to do something. It&#8217;s not just our case, we are aware of hundreds of cases where cats have been killed by those dogs. It has been going on for a couple of months now."</p> <p>&#8220;A lot of comments on my phone requested for me to arrange a GoFundMe page,&#8221; said Alliah.</p> <p>&#8220;Obviously, at the moment my mum is not in the financial situation to fund that money and we have been asked for a majority of the money up front.</p> <p>&#8220;It is difficult to get that money.&#8221;</p></div>

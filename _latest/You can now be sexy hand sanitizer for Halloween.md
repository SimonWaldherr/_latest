If 2020 had a mascot, it could be this.

Internet-favorite costume retailer Yandy has debuted their latest sexy spin for Halloween 2020: a hot hand sanitizer look.

The revealing outfit costs $69.95, and comes with a high-hip leotard printed with a fake hand sanitizer logo and a clear apron-style tutu.

“Did you disinfect from head to toe cause you’re glowing with that germ-free vibe! Just a pump is all it takes to put bacteria at bay,” reads the costume’s description on the Yandy website. “Wash away the dirt of the day, and soak in that squeaky clean feeling in this exclusive Hand Sanitizer costume featuring a mint green bodysuit with a scoop neckline, a Yandy Hand Sanitizer print with ‘Kills 99.99% of germs,’ a pink Yandy logo, and a matching clear vinyl flared dress with velcro straps attached to the skirt.”

It comes in sizes small, medium and large. The heels are not included.

The cheeky look is perfect for Instagram, the only safe place to celebrate Halloween this year. As coronavirus cases continue to rise, the CDC listed many favorite traditions, such as close indoor parties, hayrides, haunted houses and trick or treating as high-risk activities. However, Governor Andrew Cuomo said in September he won’t ban trick-or-treating in New York.

But for all their boundary-pushing costumes of years past, don’t expect to find a sexy COVID-19 costume on the site. Yandy vowed to not sell any hot coronavirus looks this year. “I don’t think there’s anything sexy about it,” Pilar Quintana-Williams, Yandy VP of Merchandising, told Business Insider.

It’s a smart move: Chinese company YTFU is under fire for selling coronavirus horror masks on Amazon.

Yandy may have learned their lesson after facing backlash in 2018 for selling a sexy spin on “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

Other zeitgeisty costumes available on the site this year include hot versions of “Tiger King” and an erotic interpretation of a mail-in ballot.

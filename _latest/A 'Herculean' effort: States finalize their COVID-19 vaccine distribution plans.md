There had been the possibility that a vaccine could become available as soon as Nov.&#160;1.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-health-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">To get ready, in Maine&#160;the public health department is planning "down to the person,"&#160;&#160;Shah said. "We're looking at how many miles our public health nurses may need to drive."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On Friday state public health departments submitted&#160;vaccination distribution plans to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The plans were as detailed as they could be given the many things that are still unknown:</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-health-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">When a vaccine or vaccines will become available.</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">Which groups will be first in line to get it and who comes next.</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">What kind of storage and refrigerator or freezer requirements they might have. At least one must be stored at -94&#176;.</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">For vaccines that require two doses (all but one),&#160;when the second dose must be administered.</li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li">Information about whether a certain vaccine works or doesn't work in specific populations such as the elderly, pregnant women or the young.&#160;</li></ul><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In a call with reporters Monday, public&#160;health officials talked about how they're preparing and what they still need.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This involves hours and hours of meetings:&#160;Last week state health officials spent two hours meeting with Pfizer just about the packaging it has&#160;developed to keep the&#160;vaccine cold as it's distributed and stored, said&#160;Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Latest news:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/10/19/covid-news-stimulus-deadline-anthony-fauci-60-minutes-donald-trump/3704077001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">&#160;Global COVID cases pass 40M; US nears 220K deaths; Fauci not surprised Trump was infected</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Deadly discrimination:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/10/18/coronavirus-asian-americans-racism-death-rates-san-francisco/5799617002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Asian Americans in San Francisco are dying at alarming rates from COVID-19: Racism is to blame</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Maine's Shah said he's having multiple meetings every day&#160;and many at night to get ready for what will be one of the biggest public health pushes of the modern era.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The final plan for who gets COVID-19 vaccine first will come from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. That committee is standing ready to meet the day or the day after a vaccine is approved,&#160;Shah said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Where will your family be?&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/02/covid-vaccine-expert-panel-lays-out-which-americans-get-first-nih-cdc/5887107002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Expert panel recommends who should be first in line for COVID-19 vaccine.&#160;</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But even without the official plan, state health officials have a pretty good idea of the distribution order based on a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/10/02/covid-vaccine-expert-panel-lays-out-which-americans-get-first-nih-cdc/5887107002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">report</a> released earlier this month by the&#160;National Academies of Sciences, Engineering&#160;and Medicine.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs answers a reporter&#8217;s question during a coronavirus news briefing in Jackson, Miss."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The first phase, 1a, is very likely to be front-line health care workers. That will make it relatively easy because those vaccinations will take place at hospitals, which are already set up for doing large-scale vaccination efforts, Shah said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It's when things get to the early stages of Phase 2, which includes people with preexisting conditions that put them at greater risk for becoming seriously ill or dying of COVID that it gets more complicated.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-health-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Maine has an older population and many people with preexisting conditions. "That's a large swath of Maine's population,"&#160;Shah said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">There's also a complex and delicate computer interface to create. All states have&#160;immunization registries to track childhood immunizations. Those are now being expanded to include COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And&#160;states are building systems to remind patients to come back for their second shot, if one is needed, and which of the possible multiple vaccines they received&#160;so they know which one to get a second time.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Also at issue: Maintaining patient privacy&#160;at a faster pace than usual &#8211;&#160;recording vaccinations within 24 hours instead of five days.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We've been telling our providers they're going to need to be reporting into our system every night," Shah said. The state's pressure-testing its systems to make sure they can handle the influx of information.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In Mississippi, state health officials have been working hard to get ready, said&#160;Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the&#160;state health officer.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"This is going to be a Herculean effort," he said.&#160;</p></div>

There's no Hail Mary for liberals who want to thwart Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation.

Even top congressional Democrats concede that their toolbox is pretty much empty as Republicans plow ahead to confirm a conservative replacement for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

"If they want to do that, we think they can before the election but we are exploring all options," Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat and 2016 vice presidential nominee, told Insider.

A blockbuster revelation from Barrett's past — which has already been heavily scrutinized — or a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in the Senate that complicates a final floor vote on her confirmation may be the only real threats to her quick confirmation.

President Donald Trump's foes are holding out hope that a last-minute political miracle will thwart Republican efforts to put Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.

But there's virtually nothing Democrats can really do to stop them.

Senate Republicans are the ones who essentially hold all the cards in determining when a confirmation vote happens, and even the on-again, off-again negotiations over a costly stimulus package wouldn't distract them from delivering another conservative justice with a lifetime appointment to the nation's most important court.

Over in the House, Democratic leaders aren't touching the ultimate break-glass-maneuver — impeaching Trump again — that some on the left were tossing out as a way to gum up the works and keep the Senate from holding a Supreme Court confirmation vote before Election Day.

Indeed, party stalwarts are all but conceding Trump and his Senate GOP allies are on the verge of installing a third justice from the current administration that will cement the court's conservative majority for decades.

"If they want to do that, we think they can before the election but we are exploring all options," Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat and the party's 2016 vice presidential nominee, recently told Insider.

Add it all up and it amounts to the ultimate gut punch for Democrats, who are raging as Republicans plan to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat just before the election after the GOP said in February 2016 that a vacancy created by the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia shouldn't be filled during an election year.

COVID-19 isn't stopping the GOP

Democrats are even more incensed that powerful Republicans from the president and first lady to three GOP senators who attended the Saturday afternoon White House Rose Garden event announcing Barrett's nomination have since tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Two of those Republicans now diagnosed with the sometimes fatal and contagious virus actually sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee: Mike Lee of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Even so, Senate Republicans are nonetheless plowing ahead with a confirmation hearing that kicked off Monday morning and GOP leadership is lining up the schedule for a floor vote to confirm Barrett before the Nov. 3 election.

There's a purely procedural reason this is all happening so fast in a chamber that carries the nickname of the "world's greatest deliberative body." The traditional tactics that rebellious senators in the minority could once use to throw a wrench into the confirmation process aren't there anymore. The Senate's top Republican, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, changed the rules in 2017 to allow Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed with the support of just 51 members of the Senate.

Before that, 60 votes were required to "end debate" and move forward to a confirmation vote, and that was a much steeper climb that required winning support from the minority party. McConnell changed the rules to ease the confirmation of Scalia's ultimate replacement, Neil Gorsuch, and it also paved the way for a largely party-line vote in 2018 for Trump's second nominee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Now, Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate. Two of them — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — say they oppose confirming a nominee before the election. If the GOP can otherwise hold its ranks, which appears likely, Barrett will get the votes she needs. Even if Republicans lose support from one more member, Vice President Mike Pence can cast a tie-breaking vote.

Changes to the Senate procedures aimed at speeding up confirmations "really reduced the power of the minority," said Don Ritchie, a former Senate historian who spent about four decades working in the Senate Historical Office before he retired in 2015. "It's very hard to stop things," he added.

That all means it'd take something truly spectacular, say a blockbuster revelation about Barrett's past, or a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in the Senate, as the only things that could truly complicate the schedule for a final floor vote on her confirmation before Election Day arrives.

Dems shift to a messaging war

Conceding that their hands are largely tied, Democrats say they intend to seize the confirmation fight as an opportunity to message against Trump and the Senate GOP. They're stressing that Barrett could soon be the deciding vote that overturns the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law whose ban on insurers turning away the sick is popular with voters.

"The biggest tool that we have is to make the American people know that this nominee poses a direct threat to their healthcare," Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Insider in a brief interview in the US Capitol.

Top congressional Democrats have circulated talking points urging their colleagues to stress that a Barrett confirmation could jeopardize the healthcare law during a pandemic, as the Supreme Court is slated to hear arguments in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act one week after the November election.

Washington insiders who want to keep Barrett off the bench have been hoping for a procedural Hail Mary from the left, but even the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, admits there's not much he can do.

"We are going to use every tool in the toolbox to try and slow things down because we think rushing through this nomination while the election is already ongoing is so so very wrong," Schumer said at a press conference earlier this month. "The problem of course is McConnell under his defiling the Senate has limited the number of tools that are in that tool box."

To showcase how little power Democrats have right now, Barrett's expected confirmation has opened the door to a fulsome debate among Washington veterans and beyond about whether to "pack the court" if Joe Biden wins the White House in a way to add additional liberal justices in 2021 or later.

Hearings plow ahead

The stakes are huge for Democrats. Replacing the liberal icon Ginsburg with conservative Barrett could tip the court's ideological leanings for a generation or more and pave the way for rulings on landmark issues from abortion to the environment. A progressive Biden agenda could find itself in the crosshairs from the new Supreme Court. Democrats are also concerned that a court that has Barrett swapped in for Ginsberg could help Trump win a second term should it take up any big election-related cases where the race remains up for grabs pending resolution of a lawsuit.

As Democrats vow to do everything they can to stop the confirmation, Republicans remain wary of any surprise tactics.

One outside source close to Republicans told Insider that McConnell had privately brought up the concern that Schumer would try to use a possible Senate floor debate over a coronavirus stimulus bill to push political amendments on the Supreme Court confirmation process. Even that approach, however, is more about slamming Republicans in the hopes of motivating voters on Election Day, rather than effectively derailing the confirmation.The probability of bringing a coronavirus stimulus to the floor before the election also remains improbable, given how far apart House Democrats, Senate Republicans, and the White House are on policy priorities and dollar amounts for the package.

Even COVID-19 infections rippling through the White House and the Senate haven't slowed things at all. While McConnell has sent the Senate into a recess, the Judiciary Committee led by Chairman Lindsey Graham on Monday launched into four days of confirmation hearings that will last through Thursday and which lawmakers can opt to attend virtually.

Several Republicans on the committee are facing tough reelection battles in November — including Graham and Tillis — but they've given every indication that they intend to have Trump's back and vote for Barrett.

Graham took flak from the left after supporting Kavanaugh during that bitterly contested confirmation fight that included allegations of sexual assault during the nominee's high school years. But the South Carolina senator who used to be a vocal Trump critic dating to the 2016 GOP presidential primaries is now leaning into his support for conservative judges as he attempts to fend off his Democratic rival Jaime Harrison.

Graham even refused to undergo a COVID-19 test ahead of a debate with Harrison slated for Friday night, prompting speculation that Graham was attempting to avoid a potential positive test that could thwart the Barrett hearings. Graham also accused Harrison of attempting to get out of the debate.

"If you want conservative judges," Graham said as he debated Harrison earlier this month, "I'm your only bet in this race."

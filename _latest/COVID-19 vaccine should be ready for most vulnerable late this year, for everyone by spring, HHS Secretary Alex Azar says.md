All three men wore masks the entire time they spoke, not taking them off at the podium as has been the practice at other government news conferences during the pandemic. It&#160;was the first time the CDC had held a media call on COVID-19 since Aug. 21.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">All three emphasized basic public health measures.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;For anybody reconnecting to school, reconnecting to work, going back to worship or reconnecting to health care or engaging in the political or civic life of our country, our advice remains the same: Wash hands, watch your distance, wear face coverings when you can&#8217;t watch your distance, avoid gatherings where you aren&#8217;t going to be able to do those things,&#8221; Azar said.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-health-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They commented on the rise in COVID case numbers across three-quarters of the country, with cases reaching 60,000 a day on average over the last week and about 700 deaths a day.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We are seeing a distressing trend here in the United States,&#8221; Butler said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Butler said he understands people are getting tired of wearing masks and taking other protective measures, but &#8220;it continues to be as important as it&#8217;s ever been,&#160;and I would say it&#8217;s more important than ever as we move into the fall season.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">More:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/health/2020/10/21/covid-vaccine-may-come-record-time-but-delivering-doses-complex/3707399001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">USA TODAY's experts say securing a COVID-19 vaccine in record time could be easy, but distributing it won't be</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He said people should be particularly careful around the holidays and urged them to consider four risks when gathering with others: the closeness of the interaction, how long it lasts, whether it&#8217;s indoors or outdoors (outside is safer), and the number of people involved. People should do what they can to minimize those risks both for themselves and to protect their loved ones and the larger community, he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Azar also said the government is considering changing quarantine requirements for people exposed to the virus.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Under current CDC guidance, those exposed to someone with COVID-19 should stay at home for 14 days, the period during which symptoms are expected to show. Now, the agency is studying whether testing an exposed person 5 or 7 days after exposure could allow their quarantine period to be shortened.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Obviously, we don&#8217;t want people to be quarantined for 14 days unnecessarily,&#8221;&#160; Azar said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Azar also stressed the process of developing a vaccine against COVID-19 has been very deliberate, scientific and &#8220;by the book.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He pointed to the fact that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/10/13/covid-19-vaccine-trials-on-hold-eli-lilly-johnson-johnson/3643936001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">two vaccine trials and a treatment trial are currently on hold</a>. In all three trials, a volunteer has become ill and the study has been paused while the illness can be investigated to determine if it is related to the vaccine or drug.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;The system&#8217;s working,&#8221; Azar said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He also listed five checks and balances in place to ensure any shot that receives federal approval will have been carefully vetted for safety and effectiveness:</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-health-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><ol class="gnt_ar_b_ol"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ol_li">Each trial has an independent data safety and monitoring board to keep track of any side effects the vaccine may trigger, and to ensure effectiveness goals are met.

  Election live updates: Trump, Biden presidential campaigns in final push 
description: > 
  Former RNC chair Michael Steele endorses BidenFormer Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele has endorsed Joe Biden, the first such endorsement of a Democratic presidential nominee in the modern era.He has become an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, serving as a senior adviser of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump super PAC.His backing comes as the Trump campaign has sought to make inroads among African American voters, especially younger Black men who have tended to support Biden in lower numbers than other age groups.Because of his role with the Lincoln Project, it's unlikely Steele would play a direct role in Biden's campaign or act as a surrogate.But he informed Biden campaign of his plans to publicly support him.

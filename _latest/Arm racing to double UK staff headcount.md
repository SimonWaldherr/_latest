Arm is facing a race against time to hit ambitious hiring pledges the British microchip company made when it was bought by Japan’s SoftBank.

The Cambridge-headquartered company has to hire 490 staff in Britain in the next 12 months to meet legally-binding pledges to double Arm’s UK headcount by September 2021.

Filings submitted to the takeover panel last week showed that it had increased UK staff numbers by 262 in the last 12 months to 3,004, compared to 208 the previous year. To meet its 2016 targets, it must have 3,494 UK staff by next September, an increase of 490.

Arm has committed to meeting the pledges despite SoftBank recently agreeing to sell the company to US giant Nvidia. Simon Segars, Arm’s chief executive, said hiring had been slowed down by the pandemic, but that it was planning to increase job numbers this year, including hiring more graduates.

“We’ve still been hiring through that period,” he said. “There will be quite a significant graduate intake.”

Arm’s $40bn (£31bn) sale to Nvidia has raised concerns that 300 UK jobs at Arm’s graphics processor division could be at risk, since Nvidia has said it plans to add its own graphics technology to Arm’s. Mr Segars said this was not the case and that Arm had no plans to sell its graphics division, Mali.

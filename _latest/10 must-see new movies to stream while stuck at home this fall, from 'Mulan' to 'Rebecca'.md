Usually when the end of August rolls around, film fans prepare for the cinematic doldrums prior to awards season. Like everything else this pandemic-filled year, however, expectation is subject to change.

Indoor movie theaters are slowly beginning to reopen as people weigh returning to cinemas for major releases like Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller "Tenet" (rolling out Monday) and the anticipated superhero sequel "Wonder Woman 1984" (Oct. 2). But for movie fans who live where theaters aren't open or who don't feel safe going, Netflix and various other streaming services are funneling new films to home devices this fall.

Some movies are hanging tough to their theatrical dates, from the crime comedy "Kajillionaire" (Sept. 18) to the horror revamp "Candyman" (Oct. 16). While we wait to see if those dates actually stick in still uncertain times, what's heading to streaming seems a lot more solid.

Here are 10 upcoming movies to definitely put on your quarantine calendar:

Remember the good old days, when you could have a heated-yet-enjoyable debate with your friends about things that didn’t matter that much, not really – like whether the pop chart should count streaming or not, or whether you could be a true Manchester United fan if you didn’t come from Manchester?

How things have changed.

Now, all the disagreements feel deadly serious. Like when your colleague pronounces that wearing a face mask in public is a threat to his liberty. Or you’re on your way to meet friends when you see that one them has just tweeted that, actually, all lives matter. Before you know it, you’re feeling angry and forming harsh new judgments about your colleagues and friends. Let’s take a collective pause and breathe: there are some ways we can all try to have more civil disagreements in this febrile age of culture wars, Brexit, Trump and Covid-19.

‘Coupling’ and ‘decoupling’

The first is to consider how much you, and the people you are disagreeing with, are inclined to ‘couple’ or ‘decouple’ the issues that you think about from wider political and social factors.

The decoupling concept originates with psychologist Keith Stanovich, who used it to describe the ability to think about hypothetical concepts separately from how things are in the real world. More recently, Swedish writer and data analyst John Nerst has developed the decoupling concept as part of ‘erisology’ (his project to study disagreement), where he uses it to describe the contrasting ways that people approach contentious issues. Those of us more prone to ‘coupling’ see them as inextricably embedded in a wider matrix of factors, whereas those more prone to ‘decoupling’ prefer to zoom in and consider an issue in isolation.

To take a crude example, a decoupler might be prepared to consider in isolation the very specific empirical question of whether a vaccine provides a degree of immunity to a virus; a coupler, by contrast, would immediately see the issue as inextricably entangled in a mesh of cultural, political and social factors, such as pharmaceutical industry power and parental choice. Crucially, Nerst believes we can often end up arguing past each other by not appreciating this fundamental difference in perspective.

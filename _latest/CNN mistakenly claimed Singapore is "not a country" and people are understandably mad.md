So, CNN messed up big time.

In an article published on October 7, CNN mistakenly wrote that Singapore is "not a country".

Of course, people are understandably pissed.

The CNN article discussed U.S. President Donald Trump's "erratic" behavior as well as his " irresponsible and politically questionable moves" since he left the hospital after being diagnosed with COVID-19.

It went on to list down countries which had lower COVID-19 cases compared to the U.S. White House.

Unfortunately, it was at this moment where CNN fucked up.

In addition to spelling Papua New Guinea incorrectly as "Papau New Guinea," the list also made a note beside Singapore's number of cases that the island nation is "not a country."

Um. What?

Obviously, people were quick to point out CNN's mistake.

In case you're not up to date on your history lessons, Singapore is recognized as a sovereign country after it separated from the Federation of Malaya back in 1965.

CNN later published a statement on their page removing the chart and apologizing for their mistake.

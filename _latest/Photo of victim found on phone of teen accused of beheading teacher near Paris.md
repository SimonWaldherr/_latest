<p>Gerald Darmanin said on French radio Europe 1 that at least 80 cases of hate speech have been reported since Friday's attack.</p><p>Paty was beheaded in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, northwest of Paris, by a 18-year-old Moscow-born Chechen refugee, who was later shot dead by police.&#160;</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron held a defense council on Sunday at the Elysee presidential palace. The government will reinforce security at schools when classes resume on Nov. 2 after two weeks of holidays, Macron's office said.</p> 
<p>A national homage is to be held for Paty on Wednesday.</p><p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered on Sunday across France in support of freedom of speech and in memory of the slain 47-year-old teacher. Many chanted "je suis prof" &#8211; I am a teacher &#8211; echoing the chants of Je suis Charlie after the Charlie Hebdo attack in 2015, Cobbe reports.</p><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/19/4e391998-b553-4bb6-915f-3da77e426feb/thumbnail/620x419/32f5f8698d95df1aca5daea9e416ae76/2020-10-18t135617z-1173467107-rc21lj9khqcr-rtrmadp-3-france-security.jpg#" alt="Tribute to Samuel Paty, the French teacher who was beheaded on the streets of the Paris suburb of Conflans St Honorine, in Lille " height="419" width="620" class=" lazyload"></span><p class="embed__caption">A girl holds a banner with a picture of Samuel Paty, the French teacher who was beheaded on the streets of the Paris suburb of Conflans St Honorine, during a tribute at the Place de la Republique, in Lille, France, October 18, 2020.</p>

              <p>French authorities said they detained 11 people following the killing. Darmanin said they include the father of a student and an Islamist activist who both "obviously launched a fatwa," or religious ruling, against the teacher.</p><p>A man who said he was the father of a student had posted a video on social media asserting that Paty had shown an image of a naked man and told students it was "the prophet of the Muslims." He called on other angry parents to contact him, and relay the message.</p>

<p>Darmanin said authorities were also looking into about 50 associations suspected of encouraging hate speech. Some will be dissolved, he said.</p><p>The president of the Conference of imams in France, Hassen Chalghoumi, said "we are hurt, we are condemning this barbaric act," on French news broadcaster BFM TV. "Samuel is a martyr of freedom."</p><p>"Barbarism has no place in schools nor elsewhere in France," he said.</p><p>Chalghoumi, who is an imam in Drancy, a suburb northeast of Paris, said he had received death threats and insults on social media from radical Islamists in recent days.</p><p>Justice authorities opened an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive. At least four of those detained are family members of the attacker, who had been granted 10-year residency in France as a refugee in March. He was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun, which fires plastic pellets.</p></div>

  Google Justice Department antitrust lawsuit explained: This is what it means for you 
description: > 
  The Justice Department on Tuesday charged Google with stifling competition and harming consumers in online search and advertising in violation of antitrust laws.The Justice Department spent more than a decade taking on Microsoft and the case it's bringing against Google has distinct echoes.“Google is the gateway to the internet and a search advertising behemoth,” U.S. Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen told reporters Tuesday.It says the government’s antitrust case is “deeply flawed” and these agreements it has struck don't box out competitors.“But they could still switch back to Google if they want, just as now they can switch away from Google,” Patterson said.

It is the first action to result from investigations by the Justice Department, Congress and state attorneys general. A group of states is pursuing&#160;a separate inquiry.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Why is DOJ going after Google?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is the first lawsuit following President Trump&#8217;s pledge to take on the massive power of Big Tech. Attorney General William Barr is bringing the case before the election.&#160;Eleven states have joined it.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Justice Department spent more than a decade taking on Microsoft and the case it's bringing against Google has distinct echoes.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-tech-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Microsoft settled that marathon litigation&#160;in 2001&#160;after appealing&#160;a judge&#8217;s ruling&#160;that it violated antitrust laws by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I suppose the Justice Department is&#160;telling the court, 'You don&#8217;t have to be scared of this case. You&#8217;ve done it before,'" says William Kovacic, a George Washington University law professor and former Federal Trade Commission chairman. "This is Microsoft part 2."</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-tech-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">What does the Google lawsuit allege?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google is owned by Alphabet Inc., which has a market value just over $1 trillion. The federal government argues Google unfairly dominates online search and advertising to the detriment of consumers and competitors and that it has struck lucrative deals to maintain its 90% control of the world&#8217;s online search market.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For example, Google plays Apple billions of dollars a year to have its search engine as the default on iPhones and other devices. The Justice Department also says Google has contracts with smartphone makers that use Google&#8217;s Android mobile operating system to make its search engine the default there, too.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Google antitrust:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/10/20/google-face-antitrust-case-filed-justice-department/5989179002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Justice Dept. files landmark case against Google</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Google Nest:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/10/19/googles-nest-hub-more-personalized-recommendations/3685209001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Google's Nest Hub video displays offering more recommendations</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google&#8217;s dominance in digital advertising &#8211;&#160;nearly all of Alphabet&#8217;s $34 billion in profit last year came from it &#8211;&#160;is also at issue.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Google is the gateway to the internet and a search advertising behemoth,&#8221; U.S. Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen told reporters Tuesday. &#8220;It has maintained its monopoly power through exclusionary practices that are harmful to competition.&#8221;</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">So what does Google say?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It says the government&#8217;s antitrust case is &#8220;deeply flawed&#8221; and these agreements it has struck don't&#160;box out competitors.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Google home page"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google says there&#8217;s plenty of choice and competition. Users can switch to other search engines such as Microsoft&#8217;s Bing or Yahoo Search, if they want.&#160;Most of Google&#8217;s services are offered for free (albeit in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell ads).</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google's argument: This is not the 1990s. People are savvy consumers who can easily switch apps and change defaults. They elect to use Google even when it&#8217;s not the default option because it&#8217;s the most helpful, not because they have to because the search results are better and the advertising more relevant, Google says.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Google also argues that there is &#8220;fierce&#8221; competition in digital advertising. &#8220;We compete for advertising dollars every day,&#8221; against Amazon, Apple, Facebook and all kinds of rivals every day, Google says.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It also warns that should the DOJ prevail, it could&#160;become harder for people to get quality search results and it could raise phone prices.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-tech-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">What are others saying?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We hope this is a sign that Justice is stepping up, and will now be keeping its eyes on the online marketplace,"&#160;George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports, said in a statement. &#8220;These powerful online platforms that connect us all on the internet must be held accountable, and competition must be protected, so that the marketplace works for consumers and for all who seek to reach them online.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We're concerned about the increasing power of a handful of dominant platforms like Google. These tech giants are gaining more control over the commerce and communications that are linked up through the internet, and people across the political spectrum are worried about it."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">What does the antitrust lawsuit mean for you?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is just the start of a lengthy legal battle. A trial could take 12 to 18 months and subsequent appeals could take years. So the lawsuit won&#8217;t have an immediate&#160;effect on internet users. But ultimately what could be at stake is&#160;a potential breakup of the internet search and advertising company.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"While this is a long and uncertain road, in the end consumers have a serious chance at getting fairer, less biased results and companies have a serious chance at&#160;getting fairer treatment as to search results and the use of their information," said Spencer Weber Waller, director of the Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies at&#160;Loyola University Chicago School of Law. "There is also a chance that, over time new companies will have a more open path to providing new and innovative choices for consumer and sellers for both basic search and search advertising."</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-tech-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But is it really possible to disrupt&#160;America's dependence on Google?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Christopher S. Yoo, director of the Center for Technology, Innovation &amp; Competition at the University of Pennsylvania, says consumers switch to Google even when it's not the default search engine.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;This means that courts will have to do the hard work of disentangling whether Google&#8217;s market position results from its superior product or from the conduct forming the basis of the government&#8217;s case," he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If the DOJ prevails, Mark Patterson, an antitrust&#160;law professor at Fordham University, says consumers could get phones, computers or browsers that are not pre-set to Google.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;But they could still switch back to Google if they want, just as now they can switch away from Google,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;Many of them will switch back, I expect, so I think the effect will be minimal."</p></div>

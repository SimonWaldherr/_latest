They recently celebrated their daughter Patricia's second birthday.

And Christine Lampard appeared to be in good spirits as she linked arms with husband Frank, 42, while enjoying a dinner date in London on Saturday night.

The Loose Women star, 41, cut a stylish figure in a tailored black suit which accentuated her svelte physique for the outing.

Christine looked sensational in her ensemble, adding some extra height to her frame with a pair of black heels.

The brunette beauty wore her long locks down and let them cascade over her shoulders as she beamed a grin at the camera.

Keeping her accessories to a minimum, Christine donned a gold watch and carried a small handbag as well as a face mask to ensure she abided all coronavirus rules.

Frank also put on a dapper display for their date night, wearing blue chinos with a polo-neck top. He completed his look with a stylish long charcoal grey jacket.

Christine's cheerful display comes after she and husband Frank celebrated daughter Patricia's second birthday last month.

The presenter and the football manager, 42, marked their little one's big day at home with a Peppa Pig-themed party.

Sharing snaps from the low-key celebration via Instagram, Christine gushed: 'Our little girl is the big 2 already!

Staying safe: Both Christine and Frank donned face masks as they left the restaurant

There she goes: The presenter's fitted trousers highlighted her svelte physique

'We mightn’t have been able to have a big party but we made up for it with a #peppapig cake, presents and plenty of balloons.'

Christine and Frank made sure to surprise Patricia by decorating their home with an array of adorable animal balloons as well as ones adorned with Peppa Pig characters.

Finishing off the fun celebration, Christine also ordered a tray full of chocolate cupcakes that were shaped like hearts and topped with other sweet treats.

As well as sharing Patricia with Frank, Christine is also step-mum to his daughters Luna, 15, and Isla, 13, who he shares with ex Elen Rivas.

Frank and Christine first crossed paths at the Pride Of Britain awards in 2009, and Christine has previously said she and Frank were not meant to be at the award show on the night they met.

Speaking on Lorraine in October, Christine said: 'It’s a strange one, because it is ten years ago that we met at them, it was one of those nights that neither of us were meant to go to.

'It was a last minute thing for him and I arrived at the awards late because of work. We were sat on tables next to each other.'

Christine added that Piers Morgan got some credit for introducing her to Frank as he 'did do an introduction', and joked: 'He was there at that moment so I can’t actually take that away from him.'

The TV personality went on to gush over Frank's skills as a father to Patricia, as she praised: 'He is very good, he has to be directed a little bit, I suppose, but he's great. He's so brilliant with her.'

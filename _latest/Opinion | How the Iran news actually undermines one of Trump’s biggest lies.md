  Opinion | How the Iran news actually undermines one of Trump’s biggest lies 
description: > 
  The wretched meaning of this is further underscored by the video that Iran has allegedly circulated.So, to be as clear as possible, this video circulated by Iran, which Ratcliffe has denounced for spreading false information about voter fraud, features Trump himself making such claims.Barr has repeatedly hyped bogus instances of voter fraud and has insisted that mail voting is susceptible to foreign counterfeiting of ballots.He noted that Ratcliffe, perhaps without realizing it, has now badly complicated Trump’s ability to make this claim going forward.ADTrump’s appearance in the video spread by Iran shows that “foreign actors don’t need to cook up disinformation,” Geltzer continued.

<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">But Ratcliffe also said something else in his Wednesday evening comments that is oddly getting overlooked: He indirectly but unequivocally confirmed that the claims that Trump has been making about voter fraud, particularly in vote-by-mail, are false.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In that way, this affair actually demonstrates just how low Trump has sunk in trying to corrupt the election: validating Trump&#8217;s efforts to undermine confidence in the integrity of the voting is a line that even Ratcliffe, who&#8217;s widely seen as a devoted Trump loyalist, won&#8217;t cross.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The centerpiece of Ratcliffe&#8217;s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/ratcliffe-says-iran-and-russia-are-taking-actions-to-influence-2020-election/2020/10/21/f14d7a60-c53f-4005-a4c0-6c99cd638a92_video.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9">announcement</a> was that Iran &#8212; and Russia, which was mysteriously downplayed &#8212; have obtained voter data enabling Iran to send emails to voters that were faked to seem like right wing efforts to menace them into voting for Trump.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Ratcliff <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/ratcliffe-says-iran-and-russia-are-taking-actions-to-influence-2020-election/2020/10/21/f14d7a60-c53f-4005-a4c0-6c99cd638a92_video.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_10">noted</a> that this was &#8220;designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage President Trump.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The idea is that these emails are supposed to associate Trump with right wing efforts to intimidate voters, harming him politically. But <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/rep-schiff-dni-director-should-not-be-trusted-without-proof-on-the-table-94362181992" target="_blank">as Democrats noted</a>, too little is known about the scheme to conclude that this was the conscious aim.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">But the other thing that Ratcliffe said about Iran is really important. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/ratcliffe-says-iran-and-russia-are-taking-actions-to-influence-2020-election/2020/10/21/f14d7a60-c53f-4005-a4c0-6c99cd638a92_video.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_14" target="_blank">Here it is</a>:</p><blockquote class="blockquote font--body gray-darkest ma-0 mb-md pl-lg b bl bw-thick"><p class="">Iran is distributing other content to include a video that implies that individuals could cast fraudulent ballots, even from overseas. This video, and any claims about such allegedly fraudulent ballots, are not true.</p></blockquote><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">You don&#8217;t say, DNI Ratcliffe. By the way, who else has been making such claims about fraudulent ballots?</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Why, Trump has, of course. And so has his attorney general, William P. Barr. And so has the president&#8217;s son, Donald Trump Jr.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The wretched meaning of this is further underscored by the video that Iran has allegedly circulated. It&#8217;s not available now because Twitter suspended the account where it had been posted.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/20/proud-boys-emails-florida/?itid=lk_inline_manual_19" target="_blank">The Post viewed the video</a>:</p><blockquote class="blockquote font--body gray-darkest ma-0 mb-md pl-lg b bl bw-thick"><p class="">The video, which was reviewed by The Washington Post, shows Trump making disparaging comments about mail-in voting, followed by a logo with the name of the Proud Boys. It then documents what was made to appear as a hack of voting data in an effort to produce a fraudulent ballot.</p></blockquote><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">So, to be as clear as possible, this video circulated by Iran, which Ratcliffe has denounced for spreading false information about voter fraud, features <i>Trump himself</i> making such claims.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Indeed, the series of claims that Ratcliffe here denounces as disinformation from a hostile foreign power &#8212; that balloting fraud is a serious problem, including from overseas, which necessarily means vote-by-mail &#8212; are ones that the President of the United States and his attorney general make on a regular basis.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">These false assertions are absolutely central to Trump&#8217;s endgame in this election. He has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/15/trump-just-repeated-his-ugliest-claim-about-election-why-isnt-it-bigger-news/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25">insisted</a> that because of mail-vote fraud, the election cannot render a legitimate outcome in which he loses. And he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/31/trump-just-told-us-how-mail-delays-could-help-him-corrupt-election/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25">openly telegraphed</a> that he&#8217;ll use this idea to try to invalidate untold numbers of ballots.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">What&#8217;s more, Barr has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/04/attorney-general-barrs-false-claims-about-voting-by-mail/?itid=lk_inline_manual_26">echoed these falsehoods</a>. Barr has repeatedly hyped bogus instances of voter fraud and has insisted that mail voting is susceptible to foreign counterfeiting of ballots.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/22/donald-trump-jr-is-actively-helping-his-father-corrupt-election/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28">stated as fact</a> that &#8220;millions&#8221; of mail ballots will inevitably be faked as part of a scheme to steal the election from his father, and has even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/22/donald-trump-jr-is-actively-helping-his-father-corrupt-election/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28">used this to mobilize</a> Trump supporters for a sustained struggle over the results.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Yet now Trump&#8217;s own DNI has flatly stated that all this is nonsense.</p><p><h3 class="font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod">Trump is a disinformation superspreader </h3></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">I ran this by Joshua Geltzer, the senior counterterrorism director at the National Security Council from 2015 to 2017. He noted that Ratcliffe, perhaps without realizing it, has now badly complicated Trump&#8217;s ability to make this claim going forward.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;Ratcliffe himself just put this in a bucket of falsity, despite Trump being the one to say it all the time,&#8221; Geltzer told me.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump&#8217;s appearance in the video spread by Iran shows that &#8220;foreign actors don&#8217;t need to cook up disinformation,&#8221; Geltzer continued. &#8220;They just need to amplify the president of the United States.&#8221; </p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;Then when his own cabinet talks about foreign disinformation, they&#8217;re actually talking about things the president has said,&#8221; Geltzer noted.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">On top of all this, Ratcliffe also confirmed that this disinformation about voter fraud is designed to &#8220;cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,&#8221; as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/ratcliffe-says-iran-and-russia-are-taking-actions-to-influence-2020-election/2020/10/21/f14d7a60-c53f-4005-a4c0-6c99cd638a92_video.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_37" target="_blank">he told reporters</a>.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump says this stuff constantly. But now his own DNI has confirmed that it&#8217;s actively harmful to the national interest.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">&#8220;He&#8217;s saying the circulation of precisely this sort of claim that Trump makes all the time is bad for American democracy and for the United States,&#8221; Geltzer concluded.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump will surely make these claims countless more times going forward, including at the final debate. Perhaps the moderator might consider asking Trump what he thinks about his own DNI&#8217;s assertion that they&#8217;re disinformation, and that they&#8217;re bad for our country.</p></div>

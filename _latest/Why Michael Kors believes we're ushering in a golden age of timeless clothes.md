<div><p>This autumn, Michael Kors, the Bugler of Beige, has re-released a camel-coloured cape that first saw the light of day twenty years ago, on <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/naomi-campbell-50-supermodels-memorable-quotes/">Naomi Campbell</a>. This time round, Kaia Gerber, 19 year-old daughter of Cindy Crawford, one of Campbell&#8217;s fellow supermodels, got to wear it on the catwalk. See how circular this fashion thing is? Even the genes get recycled.&#160;</p>
<p>Everyone assumes women&#8217;s styles change on a yearly basis, but it&#8217;s the foundations which evolve: hair, make up, and shoes. Keep on top of their constant, subtle mutations and you could wear at least some of the same clothes you own now in ten years - and beyond - and not look dated. If that&#8217;s not a recommendation for buying quality, then what is?&#160;</p>
<p>Michael Kors&#8217; spring 2021 collection, which was unveiled, digitally earlier this week, featured a stream of liquid silks, sliced into bias cut skirts and dresses , worn with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/best-places-buy-cashmere-every-shape-budget/">chunky cashmere sweaters</a>. Whatever the collective noun for a lot of soothing clothes is (a pacifier?), this collection was its incarnation.&#160;</p>

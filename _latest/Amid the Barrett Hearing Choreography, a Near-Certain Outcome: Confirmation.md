  Amid the Barrett Hearing Choreography, a Near-Certain Outcome: Confirmation 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON — The outcome of the Senate struggle over President Trump’s high court nominee was evident from the moment Senator Lindsey Graham convened the proceedings by announcing that “the hearing to confirm Judge Amy Barrett to the Supreme Court will now begin.”He could have said, as is more customary, that the Judiciary Committee hearing to consider her nomination was starting.But Mr. Graham was more truthful in saying what he did.Most times, it appeared to be less about Judge Barrett than about the differences between the two parties as they headed to Nov. 3 with Democrats and Republicans dueling over their competing ideologies.Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, used much of her allotted time to discuss the reach of the Affordable Care Act before even posing a question.After spending four years gleefully muscling more than 200 conservative judges through the Senate, Republicans were not about to be deterred from cementing a 6-to-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court for years to come by either the calendar, pandemic health risks, cries of hypocrisy or the prospect of losing their majority — and certainly not by Democrats.

WASHINGTON — The outcome of the Senate struggle over President Trump’s high court nominee was evident from the moment Senator Lindsey Graham convened the proceedings by announcing that “the hearing to confirm Judge Amy Barrett to the Supreme Court will now begin.”

He could have said, as is more customary, that the Judiciary Committee hearing to consider her nomination was starting. But Mr. Graham was more truthful in saying what he did. Judge Barrett’s confirmation has always been the virtually certain result of the hearing and the coming Senate vote just days before Election Day, and that was more apparent than ever on Tuesday as senators questioned her

With the hearing taking place closer to an election than any other Supreme Court confirmation — and with the Senate Republican majority at real risk — the proceeding was imbued with electoral politics perhaps to a greater degree than any previous one. Most times, it appeared to be less about Judge Barrett than about the differences between the two parties as they headed to Nov. 3 with Democrats and Republicans dueling over their competing ideologies. Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, used much of her allotted time to discuss the reach of the Affordable Care Act before even posing a question.

After spending four years gleefully muscling more than 200 conservative judges through the Senate, Republicans were not about to be deterred from cementing a 6-to-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court for years to come by either the calendar, pandemic health risks, cries of hypocrisy or the prospect of losing their majority — and certainly not by Democrats.

description: > 
  Lynne Sladky/Associated PressDays after he made his NFL debut, the Miami Dolphins are making 2020 first-round pick Tua Tagovailoa their starting quarterback, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.Tagovailoa stepped onto the field for the first time in Sunday's 24-0 win over the New York Jets.Tagovailoa was clearly going to replace Ryan Fitzpatrick at some point.To see him elevated to the starting job after six games is a bit of a surprise, though.Assuming he's still the starter, Tagovailoa is slated to face off with a pair of fellow rookies down the line.

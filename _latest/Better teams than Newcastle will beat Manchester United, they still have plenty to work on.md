<div><p>And even the Glazer family, across the Atlantic Ocean, needed this victory a week after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/15/project-big-picture-sent-shockwaves-football-set-tone-future/">their grubby plan to seize control of English football was exposed</a> by Telegraph Sport. Project Big Picture took three years to plan and barely lasted three days once it became public so they should focus on what needs to be done to improve their own club, rather than try to tell the rest of us how to make English football better in the middle of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>However, it is, relatively speaking, easy to win a football match, particularly with the attacking players Solskjaer has and their ability to pick teams off on the counter. Far harder to put a run of good results together.</p>
<p>It is surely, also, only a matter of time until Donny van de Beek starts a Premier League fixture. Manchester United were far better when he slotted into the midfield and he played a key role in the build up to Bruno Fernandes&#8217;&#160;crucial goal which gave them the lead for the first time with four minutes remaining.</p>
<p>Yet, until that point, Newcastle were holding their own. Under the cosh, yes, but they did not look like conceding, with goalkeeper Karl Darlow making good saves when needed while most efforts came from long range as his defence packed the area in front of him.</p>
<p>Darlow was playing on one leg, following a nasty collision with Marcus Rashford by the time the visitors scored their three late goals and, without fans inside to demand some resolve, Newcastle threw in the towel at 2-1.</p>
<p>Take a moment to view the highlights, though, and you will see the Magpies also created plenty of chances. Better teams will take them. Manchester United have much still to work on.</p>

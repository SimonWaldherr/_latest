Former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is wanted by both Manchester United and Manchester City, according to reports, with the future of their managers shrouded in doubt.

The Argentinian is locked and loaded for his Premier League return, revealing his 'tank is completely full' as he searches for his next job.

Pochettino was sacked by Spurs almost a year ago and has taken time to recharge amid constant links to Barcelona, Madrid and Manchester.

Both Manchester United and Manchester City are keen on Mauricio Pochettino taking over

United are considering sacking Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after a shocking start to the season

Pep Guardiola could also leave City at the end of the season as he is yet to sign a new deal

Meanwhile, Manchester United have endured a horrendous start to the 2020-21 season and Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is still yet to sign a new deal at the Etihad. The Catalan's contract expires in just seven months.

Both clubs are now forced to consider alternate options and believe Pochettino would be an ideal replacement, according to the Sun.

Pochettino never won silverware but oversaw an incredible transformation at Spurs, rising from a status as outsiders to become a serious threat on a tight budget, guiding the North Londoners to the Champions League final.

That's a stage United haven't been close to since Sir Alex Ferguson quit, and a return to the top still seems a long way off.

Pochettino's management of Tottenham has made him a front-runner for Europe's top jobs

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is once again under pressure after failing to transfer United's post-restart form in 2019-20 to the new season, being battered 6-1 by Spurs in their last match.

Meanwhile City have also stuttered, embarrassed 5-2 by Leicester and held 1-1 by newly promoted Leeds.

The Citizens' Champions League failure last season, crashing out to Lyon in the Champions League final, also left Guardiola's main objective of becoming champions of Europe still unfulfilled.

Those failings could be behind Guardiola's unwillingness to commit to the club, and Pochettino will be one of the front-runners to succeed him.

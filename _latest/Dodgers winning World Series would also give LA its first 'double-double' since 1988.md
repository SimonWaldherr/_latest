After failing to advance beyond the National League Division Series in 2019, the Dodgers will play the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2020 World Series starting Tuesday.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Now that they get another shot at it, it would pretty disappointing for everybody in the organization if they can&#8217;t finish this one off,&#8217;&#8217; said Orel Hershiser, the former Dodgers pitcher who was the MVP of the 1988 World Series. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the perfect scenario to write the next chapter.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">By that, Hershiser was referring in part to the Lakers&#8217; winning the 2020 NBA Finals, as they did in 1988, when Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy led the Lakers past the Detroit Pistons.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Four months after the Lakers beat the Detroit Pistons in Game 7, the Dodgers won the World Series title with a victory over the Oakland A&#8217;s&#160; in Game 5. It was in Game 1 that Kirk Gibson limped to the plate and hit a pinch-hit&#160;home run that lifted the Dodgers to a stunning victory over the mighty A&#8217;s.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I feel bad when people bring up &#8217;88 for the current guys because they&#8217;ve heard it so much, and how many ways can you answer the questions?&#8217;&#8217; Hershiser said. &#8220;How many ways can you spin the stories, other than, &#8216;We haven&#8217;t gotten it won yet?&#8217; &#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Lakers felt their own burden, having failed to make the playoffs since 2013 as James entered his second season with the Lakers.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But Thompson, the former Lakers post player, said he and former Lakers teammates Michael Cooper and Byron Scott envisioned a new era for the Lakers and Dodgers during conversations at Lakers games before the coronavirus pandemic temporarily shut down sports.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We always talk about the Dodgers because they were getting ready to go to camp and we knew how deep this team was,&#8217;&#8217; Thompson said. &#8220;We saw how the Lakers were basically running the NBA. They had the No. 1 team outside of Milwaukee, so we knew the Lakers were going to get to the Finals.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We&#8217;d talk about 1988, and we could see a repeat of that year because both teams are so strong.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Indeed, James&#160;and Davis proved too much for the competition inside the bubble at Disney World in Florida. And the Dodgers, down three games to one against the Atlanta Braves, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/playoffs/2020/10/18/dodgers-braves-nlcs-game-7-mlb-playoffs/3707698001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">rallied and on Sunday night beat the Braves 4-3 in Game 7</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to the World Series!!!&#8217;&#8217; tweeted none other than Magic Johnson, whois now a part owner of the Dodgers hoping for a World Series ring.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Said Thompson, the former Laker, &#8220;We see Magic and we tell him, &#8216;You&#8217;re going to get that baseball ring one of these days.&#8217; This could be the year.&#8217; &#8221;</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/mlb/2020/10/17/mookie-betts-dodgers-makes-crazy-catch-nlcs/3698938001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

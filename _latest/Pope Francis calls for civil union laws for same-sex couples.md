<div><p>Pope Francis has spoken up in <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/20/pope-francis-to-parents-of-lgbt-kids-god-loves-your-children/">defense of homosexual families</a> and called for civil union laws for same-sex couples &#8212; a major shift from both his own and the Vatican&#8217;s position on the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They&#8217;re children of God and have a right to a family,&#8221; the pontiff says in a new documentary, &#8220;Francesco,&#8221; <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-calls-for-civil-union-law-for-same-sex-couples-in-shift-from-vatican-stance-12462" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Catholic News Agency</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it,&#8221; the Pope reportedly says in the doc, that premiered Oct. 21 at the Rome Film Festival.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered,&#8221; the pope said. &#8220;I stood up for that.&#8221;</p>

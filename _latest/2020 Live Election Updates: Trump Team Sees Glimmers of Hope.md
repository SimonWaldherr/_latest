<div><p>Voters in two states report receiving threatening &#8220;vote for Trump&#8221; emails. Two candidates for Utah governor are appearing in ads together to promote civility.</p><p class="css-608m5d" id="while-trump-stirs-up-new-feuds-his-advisers-see-hope-in-narrow-polls"></p><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="President Trump held a campaign rally in Erie, Pa., on Tuesday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/world/21elections-briefing-trump-fights/merlin_178819461_3f10cd36-f6ff-4b48-9593-0a4e30554023-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">President Trump held a campaign rally in Erie, Pa., on Tuesday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Doug Mills/The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Monday, President Trump picked a fight with Anthony Fauci, the nation&#8217;s top infectious disease expert. On Tuesday, it was Lesley Stahl, the &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; correspondent, who was caught in the president&#8217;s cross hairs, after he cut short an interview in frustration and then mocked her on Twitter for not wearing a mask at the White House after the interview.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Feuding with individuals who are not actually Mr. Trump&#8217;s opponent, in a race that is two weeks away, has struck many in his orbit as a waste of limited time when he should be singularly focused on making the race a referendum on Joseph R. Biden Jr., the person he is actually running against.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But his advisers saw gleams of hope, nonetheless.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For one, their internal numbers over the past three weeks have stabilized after the double whammy of the first presidential debate, in which Mr. Trump&#8217;s aggressive performance hurt him, and then his subsequent hospitalization for the coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And while Mr. Biden continues to lead in places like Wisconsin and Arizona, he has also done so without breaking decisively into a double-digit lead, leaving open the possibility that the race will tighten alarmingly on Election Day, when in-person ballots come in.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Trump campaign officials are also watching the mammoth early voting numbers come in with some skepticism, because there&#8217;s nothing to compare them to. They think Democrats are not close to reaching the number of mail ballot requests they need if more than 40 percent of their voters plan to vote by mail.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">An ABC News poll released Tuesday showed a one-point race in the battleground state of North Carolina, with Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump 49 percent to 48 percent, and was heralded as good news for a campaign that has invested heavily in the swing state.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And they think the Thursday night debate offers Mr. Trump one last chance to reset the dynamics before Election Day. Some of his advisers have told him to try and employ some humor, even acknowledging the reality that many of the suburban women voters and older voters he needs are turned off by his tone and his Twitter feed. One person advised him to pledge to tweet less in a second term.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump, however, has never been easy to coach, and is already coming in fuming, not only at Mr. Fauci and Ms. Stahl, but at the Presidential Debate Commission, for changing the rules, and at the moderator, Kristen Welker of NBC News, who he has been trying to claim is biased <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/anniekarni/status/1317558617411883009" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">despite having praised her work in the past.</a></p></div>

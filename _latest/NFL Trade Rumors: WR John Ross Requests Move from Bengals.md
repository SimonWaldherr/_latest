  NFL Trade Rumors: WR John Ross Requests Move from Bengals 
description: > 
  David Richard/Associated PressCincinnati Bengals wide receiver John Ross has reportedly requested a trade ahead of the Week 8 deadline.Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reported Ross wants a "fresh start" before hitting free agency after the 2020 season.The Bengals declined the fifth-year option in Ross' contract earlier this year, which will make him an unrestricted free agent in 2021.I need to stay healthy, and I need to make plays in every single game," Ross told reporters in August.It's unclear what the Bengals could get for Ross in return on the trade market, but it would likely be nothing more than a conditional late-round pick.

However, it's better than nothing and would potentially give Ross a chance to prove he's worth a team taking a chance on giving him a more extended role in 2021.&#160;</p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png">Video Play Button</a><p class="atom video-indicator"><p class="text">Videos you might like </p> </p></div>

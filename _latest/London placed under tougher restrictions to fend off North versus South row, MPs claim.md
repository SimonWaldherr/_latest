The decision has fuelled claims that ministers are attempting to placate local leaders in the north of England, who are resisting calls for their areas to be put into Tier 3 â€“ the most severe level of restrictions.

Other MPs believe the growing number of areas being placed under tighter lockdown measures will effectively lead to another "national lockdown by stealth".

It comes amid growing expectation among ministers that Mr Johnson will be forced to announce regional "circuit-breakers" lockdowns by the end of the month to slow the rapid increase in Covid-19 cases.

While the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has called for a national "circuit-breaker" lasting between two and three weeks, Government sources have suggested a series of regional lockdowns is more likely.

During a briefing with the health minister Helen Whately on Thursday morning, London MPs were shown new data revealing that cases across the city have surged over the past fortnight.

Speaking shortly after the briefing, the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: "The virus is spreading rapidly in every corner of our city. We will soon reach an average of 100 cases per 100,000 people, with a significant number of boroughs already over that threshold.

"Hospital admissions are up, more patients are going into intensive care units, and sadly the number of Londoners dying is again increasing every day."

She joined Kaia Gerber, Laura Dern and Barbie Ferreira an the A-list campaign.

And Kendall Jenner shared more shots modeling a sheer gown from Givenchy's latest collection to Instagram.

The 24-year-old used a simple stool prop in the photos posted on Friday as she posed in the glamorous gown in an at-home photoshoot.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star modeled evening wear, making a dazzling display in a gown embellished with sparkling beads but still sheer enough to reveal blue boots and a matching bra below.

Long white opera gloves were also adorned with sparkle and the sometimes reality star wore a chunky silver chain around her neck.

A shiny brown bag with heavy hardware sat below the IMG model, who was perched on a high stool in several of the photos.

She also got onto the floor in a high-knee squat position as the bag took center stage on the stool above her.

Balance: Kendall balanced squatting on a stool, and seemed to share a BTS snap as she balanced in the glamorous dress

In the photos posted to her Instagram stories she tagged the French fashion house and Creative Director Matthew Williams.

Another set of snaps were taken in front of a projector beaming scenes of sharks and cityscapes.

In her caption she sent Williams her well wishes, writing: 'Congrats you genius!!! what a beautiful collection.'

Earlier in the day, other stars also shared their snaps in the designer brand's latest collection.

Kaia Gerber put on a sizzling display while modeling a tiny white dress in Givenchy's latest campaign.

Looking simply angelic, Kaia flaunted her figure in a tight white dress made up of tiny strips of fabric which were perfectly contoured to her body, for her at-home pictures.

The model daughter of Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber crouched down in a corner or her house, showing off lush looking accessories which included a vanilla-hued crocodile skin bag and white slides.

Kaia's shoulder skimming bob looked fresh and for makeup, she went with classic smokey eyes and arched brows.

'congratulations to my amazing friend @matthewmwilliams and @givenchyofficial on this gorgeous new chapter together,' she wrote in her caption, adding 'Yhank you [hairstylist Frida Svala] for the photos.'

Euphoria's Barbie Ferreira radiated sexiness in a crimson dress with a thin string as a halter and chain details spilling down the front.

The scarlet number had a high slit on the leg and the back dipped low, letting the 23-year-old talent show some skin.

Much has been made of the 34-year-old urbanwear designer's new role at Givenchy, having previously worked with the likes of Kanye West and Lady Gaga, and also alongside Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh and Christian Dior’s Kim Jones

The great outdoors: Laura Dern went for sophisticated chic in her shoot, posing outdoors while donning a sharply tailored suit and clutching onto the same sort of croc-skin bag featured in her peers' photos

He also has his own brand, 1017 ALYX 9SM, an upscale street style brand named after his eldest daughter.

Reflecting on how his work with Gaga and Kanye prepared him for Givenchy, Williams told The New York Times: 'That’s really hard to synthesize in two sentences, but it was an amazing education being beside these two creatives when they were inventing, and still are, at a pace that was so fast.'

'It wasn’t like collections, where we’re working in seasons that take months. It was like every week a new idea and a new project and a new collaborator. That pace and work ethic was something that really stayed with me, and I’m really fortunate. It was really formative for me.'

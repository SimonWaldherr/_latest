<div><p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat is about to launch <a href="https://story.snapchat.com/p/ebd99145-16a6-4026-b06b-cb4ca64d91fe">&#8220;First Person,&#8221;</a> the first of its original series to be shot on Snapchat Spectacles.</p>
<p>The idea of filming a documentary using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/snapchat-spectacles-3-review-pretty-pricey/">AR-centric eyewear</a> might sound gimmicky, but &#8220;First Person&#8221; is tackling a weighty topic: climate change.</p>
<p>The series is produced by journalist Yusuf Omar (who said he&#8217;s been wearing Spectacles &#8220;every day of my life since 2016&#8221;) and his <a href="https://hashtagourstories.com">Hashtag Our Stories</a> program, which has trained more than 10,000 people in 140 countries to create journalism with their mobile phones.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>&#8220;First Person&#8221; sounds like an extension of that work &#8212; the team sent Spectacles to subjects in six countries so that they could document the work that they&#8217;re doing to fight climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Covid-19 hit, a lot of global media productions stopped shooting,&#8221; Omar told me via email. &#8220;But our innovators didn&#8217;t stop working. Shipping Spectacles to them allowed us to reach stories, otherwise impossible to tell during the coronavirus crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that filming with Spectacles isn&#8217;t just a production method &#8212; it also allows viewers to literally see things from a climate activist&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beauty of capturing POV Specs footage for a series like this is that we get to witness change makers actually getting their hands dirty and creating, upcycling, recycling and making the change they want to see,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Their physical actions, seeing both hands at work, through their vantage point make their actions relatable, interesting and immersive. When young audiences watch it, they think &#8216;I can probably do that too.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, the series also includes AR lenses for each episode &#8212; one lens, for example, will add cracks to your floor to indicate water shortage, while another will add carbon dioxide clouds in the sky to illustrate carbon emissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;First Person&#8221; premieres this Saturday, October 24. You can watch the trailer below.</p>

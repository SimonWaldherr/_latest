The second debate -- a virtual one -- between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee and former vice president, Joe Biden, was on. Until it wasn't.

The Commission on Presidential Debates said on Thursday that the next debate, scheduled for Oct. 15, would be a virtual one with both candidates appearing from different locations. The decision came after Trump returned to the White House following treatment for the coronavirus at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He's still receiving treatment for COVID-19 since testing positive for the virus last week.

But Trump said on Fox News shortly after the CPD announcement that he wouldn't participate in the debate. Trump campaign manager Bill Sepien, who also contracted COVID-19, said in a statement that the president would hold a rally instead.

"For the swamp creatures at the President Debate Commission to now rush to Joe Biden's defense by unilaterally canceling an in-person debate is pathetic," he said.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said on Tuesday that the second presidential debate should not be held if Trump continues to test positive for the virus. But he added that he'd base his decision to participate in the debate on recommendations from health officials.

"Well, I think if he still has COVID, we shouldn't have a debate," Biden told reporters. "I think we're gonna have to follow very strict guidelines. Too many people have been infected, and it's a very serious problem."

Biden has been tested four times since he and Trump stood together on a debate stage in Ohio last week, his campaign said. All four of those tests have come back negative.

Trump previously said he still intended to debate Biden on Oct. 15, his campaign told CBS News on Monday. After spending the weekend at Walter Reed, on Monday night he returned to the White House, where he continues to be monitored by a team of doctors.

On Sunday, White House physician Sean Conley told reporters that Trump's blood oxygen level had dropped suddenly on two occasions and that the president was being given the steroid dexamethasone. A number of specialists say the use of the steroid suggests Trump's condition is serious.

Trump left the hospital on Monday evening, however, and returned to the White House. He appeared on a balcony and also tweeted out a video in which he said he was better and downplayed the threat of the virus, which has killed nearly 210,000 Americans. "Don't let it dominate you," he said. "Don't be afraid of it."

It's still unclear if Trump's condition will change. Conley told reporters that the president "may not be entirely out of the woods yet" and that Trump's medical team will continue close monitoring at the White House. On Tuesday, Conley released a memo in which he reported that Trump had told doctors that morning that he wasn't experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19.

Since the president came down with the virus, his reelection campaign has either postponed his events or switched them to virtual offerings. So far, the Commission on Presidential Debates has't made a statement regarding the status of the next two presidential debates, which are scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, Florida, and Oct. 22 in Nashville, Tennessee. Also, there hasn't been any word on what precautions may be taken to ensure the safety of the candidates. The commission didn't respond to a request for comment.

Representatives of the Biden and Trump campaigns weren't available to comment for this article.

The one and only vice presidential debate, between Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris, took place Wednesday in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Commission on Presidential Debates approved the use of plexiglass to create a barrier between the two candidates.

In keeping with the unpredictable and unprecedented year we've had, a lot could happen before the next presidential debate.

Here's a look at what Trump's condition could mean for the next two presidential debates.

They could be canceled

The timeline for when Trump became infected and when he first started showing symptoms is fuzzy. But he said the positive test result was returned on Thursday, and technically he should be in isolation for 14 days, according to guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That would take us right to the day of the debate, and he could continue to test positive until then. Also, even though he's left the hospital and says he's better, specialists say there's a chance he could take a turn for the worse, and given his age and weight, he's still at risk of developing serious illness.

They could be postponed

If Trump were to experience complications or if health officials advising the campaigns suggest it's unsafe to debate on Oct. 15 or Oct. 22, the commission may postpone the events. But logistically that could be difficult, given how close we are to the Nov. 3 election. It would likely be hard to find new dates that would satisfy both campaigns. Still, if there wasn't time to reschedule both debates, perhaps one of them would still take place.

They could go virtual

A week before Trump and Biden were to face-off in a second debate, the Commission on Presidential Debates decided that for the "health and safety of all involved,"to make the debate a virtual event. This debate, which was to be held in Miami, was supposed to be a town hall style event where audience members were to ask questions of each candidate. According to the plan, Trump and Biden would have been in different locations answering the debate questions. But Trump rejected the idea, calling it "ridiculous." And then he accused the commission, without any evidence, of trying to help Biden's campaign.

"I'm not going to waste my time on a virtual debate, that's not what debating is all about," Trump said during an interview with Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo. "You sit behind a computer and do a debate â€” it's ridiculous."

They could go on as planned

It's clear from the past few days that Trump wants to project an image of health and dominance over the coronavirus. So it's likely he'll push for the debates to go on as planned, regardless of whether health officials recommend it. The answer may come down to what the Biden campaign decides to do. If Trump continues to test positive, the Biden team will likely cancel or possibly postpone at least the first debate. If Trump tests negative and doesn't experience a relapse in the next week, both debates may go on as expected.

So stay tuned.

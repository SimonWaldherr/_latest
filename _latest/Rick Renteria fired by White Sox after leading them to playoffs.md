After leading the Chicago White Sox to their first postseason appearance since 2008, manager Rick Renteria has “agreed to part ways” with the organization, GM Rick Hahn announced Monday.

Renteria guided the White Sox to a 35-25 record and a second-place finish in the AL Central in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, his fourth as Chicago manager, before falling to the Oakland A’s in the best-of-three first round playoff series.

Pitching coach Don Cooper also was let go, the team announced. Renteria had one year remaining on his contract, and the team’s release stated the status of the remainder of his coaching staff, “will be determined in consultation with the team’s next manager.”

The 58-year-old Renteria, who also skippered the crosstown Cubs in 2014, owns a 309-398 record (.437) in five seasons as a manager in the major leagues. The abridged 2020 campaign represented only the White Sox second winning season in the past 10 years. He replaced Robin Ventura as the team’s 40th manager in 2016 after spending one season as a bench coach for the former Mets and Yankees third baseman.

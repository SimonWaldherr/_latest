<div><p>Only time will tell if it proves 10th time lucky for Manchester City in the Champions League this season but they overcame an early fright here to begin their latest pursuit of European glory with a hard-fought victory.</p>
<p>Porto gave it everything they had, including plenty of play-acting and some familiar theatrics from that old pantomime villain, Pepe, who doubtless drew encouragement from the selective myopia of the Latvian referee, but City had too much in the end.</p>
<p>Behind to a fine run and finish from Luis Diaz that will no doubt have evoked familiar feelings of unease in Pep Guardiola on this stage, City equalised through Sergio Aguero&#8217;s penalty but had to bide their time before finally finding a way through Porto&#8217;s obdurate system.</p>
<p>Ilkay Gundogan put City in front with a lovely free-kick on his first start since returning from a bad bout of coronavirus before substitute Ferran Torres got his second goal for the club to put a little gloss on the scoreline.</p>
<p>It flattered City, in truth, although it could have been worse for Porto. Riyad Mahrez missed a good chance and Pepe was fortunate not to concede a penalty and even avoid a red card after tripping Raheem Sterling and then thrusting a leg into the England forward&#8217;s side after having the temerity to accuse the City player of play-acting. He has some gall.</p>
<p>It was a fractious night. City picked up five bookings but, with the exception of a tackle by Walker, it was hard to remember a foul among them as Porto milked every challenge they could. The bad blood was felt on the sidelines, with Porto coach Sergio Conceicao walking off and making a beeline for the referee at the final whistle before Guardiola could shake his hand.</p>

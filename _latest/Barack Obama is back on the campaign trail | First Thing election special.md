<div><p>The 44th US president told Biden supporters in Pennsylvania: &#8216;Trump isn&#8217;t going to protect us.&#8217; Plus, could Borat swing the election?</p><p>Good morning,</p>
<p>Joe Biden&#8217;s former boss returned to the campaign trail on his behalf on Wednesday. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/21/obama-trump-campaign-biden-philadelphia" class="u-underline">Barack Obama told a drive-in rally in Philadelphia</a> that this was &#8220;the most important election of our lifetime&#8221; and urged Americans to deliver a rebuke so resounding to Trump at the ballot box that he could not dispute the result.</p>

 </p> FBI warns Iran and Russia obtained voter data in election interference effort &#8211; video


<p>Russia and Iran are using US voter registration information to try to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/21/russia-iran-us-voter-data-security-fbi-election" class="u-underline">sow unrest ahead of the election</a>, the Trump administration&#8217;s national intelligence director, John Ratcliffe, said in a press conference on Wednesday. The news comes after Democratic voters in swing states including Florida and Pennsylvania received threatening emails purporting to be from the far-right Proud Boys group, warning the recipients &#8220;we will come after you&#8221; if they did not vote for Trump.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe characterised Iran&#8217;s efforts as &#8220;designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage President Trump&#8221;, but Democrats pushed back on the idea that the attacks were aimed at the president, describing Ratcliffe &#8211; a Trump loyalist &#8211; as a &#8220;partisan hack&#8221;.</p>

 </p> Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is released on Friday on Amazon Prime. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images


<p>While Rudy Giuliani was busy trying to whip up outrage over Hunter Biden&#8217;s emails, Sacha Baron Cohen was waiting to spring an October surprise on Giuliani himself. On Wednesday, it emerged that Trump&#8217;s personal lawyer would appear in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/21/rudy-giuliani-faces-questions-after-compromising-scene-in-new-borat-film" class="u-underline">potentially mortifying sequence from the new Borat movie</a>, featuring a &#8220;flirtatious&#8221; interview with an actor pretending to be the bumbling Kazakh reporter&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p>Giuliani has denied any impropriety. &#8220;At no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate,&#8221; the former New York mayor told WABC. &#8220;If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Could Borat swing the election? </strong>Cohen&#8217;s comedy sequel joins <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/22/borat-v-trump-can-entertainment-really-affect-an-election" class="u-underline">a host of urgent documentaries and dramas</a> released in the run-up to 3 November. But most of them preach to the choir, writes Charles Bramesco. And besides, &#8220;many subscribers to the Trumpist worldview are not the most receptive to the swaying powers of art&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Borat 2 reviewed. </strong>Despite some laughs and a few pointed political moments, says our critic Peter Bradshaw, it is 14 years since Borat&#8217;s first cinematic outing &#8211; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/21/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-review-sacha-baron-cohen-trump" class="u-underline">the shock of the new is gone</a>.&#8221;</p></li>

The Ivy League has been the most proactive in the country in prioritizing the health and safety of their student-athletes above sports. Still, less than one month after Yale allowed its teams to begin conducting limited practices the school has seen a COVID-19 outbreak occur on its men’s hockey team, infecting 18 members.

The school had announced Tuesday that six members of the hockey team had contracted the coronavirus, and an additional 12 positive cases were found over the next two days, according to CNN. Yale, which had recently moved on to Phase II of in-person physical activity, has reverted to Phase 0, and raised its COVID-19 alert status from “green” (lower risk of viral transmission) to “yellow” (low to moderate risk).

Stephanie Spangler, the Vice Provost for Health Affairs and Academic Integrity, told students that “rigorous” contact tracing has begun and that all athletic teams would halt in-person activities for at least one week. The ice hockey rink will also be closed through at least Oct. 19 for cleaning.

“All other members of the men’s ice hockey team who are in the New Haven area, as well as the Athletics staff who have worked directly with them, have been instructed to quarantine and to participate in the university testing program, whether or not they have been identified as close contacts of infected team members,” Spangler wrote in a letter to the Yale community.

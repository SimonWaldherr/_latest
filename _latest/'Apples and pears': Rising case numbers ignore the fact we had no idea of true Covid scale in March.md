Health officials presented a grim picture. The very first slide, at Monday's briefing from Number 10, showed soaring levels of Covid-19 across the population – seemingly now at three times the level they reached at the peak of the pandemic.

However, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, felt compelled to admit those numbers came with a hefty health warning.

While statistics showing around 15,000 positive cases a day appeared to compare badly with highs of around 5,000 a day back in April and May, in fact, “this is an apples and pears comparison", the medic said.

In the spring, of course, there was no routine testing for suspected Covid-19 cases, meaning any infections which were detected were only the tip of the iceberg.

Two weeks ago, Prof Patrick Vallance, the country’s chief scientific advisor, admitted the real daily figure at the height of the first wave was more likely to have been around 100,000 a day, a figure which would dwarf current numbers.

And yet, when the Government was casting around for useful statistics to present, as the Prime Minister prepared to announce swingeing restrictions, it was the graph showing the seeming tripling in cases that was chosen as the first visual image the public would see.

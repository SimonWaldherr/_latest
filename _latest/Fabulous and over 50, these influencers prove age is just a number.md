<div><p>These guys and gals born before 1970 prove that you&#8217;re never too old to be hale and hearty, even in a pandemic. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single dose of Instagram inspiration.</p>
<h2><strong>Michele C. Reed, 52</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/fitdocmichelereed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@fitdocmichelereed</a><br>
<a href="http://fitdoc.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michele Reed, DO, CPT,</a> is a family physician and certified personal trainer, who also penned <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mentally-Fit-Physically-Strong-Revised/dp/098444758X?tag=nypost-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;Mentally Fit Physically Strong&#8221;</a> (Pipe Publishing). She&#8217;s also a three-time marathoner. Having come down with COVID-19 back in March, Reed used the setback as an opportunity for growth. When she was given the green light to resume exercise at the end of April, she decided to ask her followers to work out with her from afar. Though initially she could barely make it 200 feet without getting tired, in May she asked her group to join her in walking, running, jogging or biking a mile a day. In June, the crew upped the ante by combining the mile-long trek with a martial arts&#8217;-inspired core workout with Master Michael Wyands. This month&#8217;s challenge? Try something new and different at least once a week. Reed ticked that dare off her list by trying the trapeze for the first time.<br>
<strong>Top tip:</strong> &#8220;Sleep is a great thing and never underestimate your body&#8217;s need for a nap. Listen to your body and it will tell you what it needs.&#8221;<br>
<strong>Pandemic survival strategy:</strong> &#8220;I know that I need to exercise to keep my immune system strong. By asking my followers to do a monthly challenge with me, we could all get stronger and healthier together.&#8221;</p>

<a href="http://juliekaminski.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Julie Kaminski, MA, NBC-HWC</a>, mom of two college students, took to walking the road. Her Facebook page, The Walking Book Club Discussion Group, has grown to over 8,300 fans, amassing some 4,000 members. The global, virtual community encourages people to engage the body (walk, cycle, run, tap dance) while listening to audiobooks, thereby simultaneously flexing the mind. The group also offers daily posts to keep members motivated to live healthy, coaching prompts for goal setting and book extras. This year, Kaminski hosted Zoom events with authors like Lisa Wingate and Jeanine Cummins for various charities, including the <a href="https://www.rescue.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Rescue Committee</a> and <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Feeding America</a>, and has raised close to $4,000.<br>
<strong>Top tip: </strong>&#8220;Take time to recognize &#8216;cupcake moments&#8217; and gratitude. &#8216;Cupcake moments&#8217; are bite-size positive occurrences that deserve savoring. They might be the smallest of happenings like a full moon, a hot cup of coffee or a surprise call from a friend. Like gratitude, they shift the brain&#8217;s attention towards the positive.&#8221;<br>
<strong>Pandemic survival strategy:</strong> &#8220;Connect with people that make you smile. Positive relationships may be the most critical element of a thriving life. While dinner dates with friends might be on hold this winter, set some small goals to call or Zoom with a few of your favorite peeps.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tomhfit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@tomhfit</a><br>
<a href="http://www.teamholland.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tom Holland, MS, CSCS, CISSN,</a> is an exercise physiologist and author of numerous books including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Micro-Workout-Plan-Body-without-Minutes-ebook/dp/B07XDJ675Z?tag=nypost-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;The Micro Workout Plan&#8221; </a>(Sterling Publishing) also hosts the <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-fitness-disrupted-with-to-49559279/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iHeartRadio podcast &#8220;Fitness Disrupted.&#8221;</a> The 26-time Ironman also inspires his clients at the gym as a sought-after performance coach (right now, through ye olde computer screen.)<br>
<strong>Top tip: </strong>&#8220;Focus on doing micro-workouts, shorter workouts done throughout the day, say five minutes of core exercises in the morning and a 20-minute walk at lunch. It all adds up. Minutes matter. Success in exercise comes from &#8216;Excessive Moderation,&#8217; a term which I coined to mean it&#8217;s not about doing a lot of exercise a little bit, it&#8217;s about doing a little bit a lot.&#8221;<br>
<strong>Pandemic survival strategy:</strong> &#8220;Don&#8217;t fret about not going to the gym. You don&#8217;t have to do an hour, or even a half hour for that matter. Research shows that three 10-minute bouts of exercise has the same effect as one continuous thirty minute session. When lack of time is the number one reason cited for failure to exercise, that&#8217;s great news.&#8221;</p>

Frank Lipman is chief medical officer of <a href="http://the-well.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Well</a>, an immune supplement website. Lipman recommends curcumin, an anti-inflammatory and powerful ingredient to help with both immunity and longevity. In fact, he helped to develop the Well&#8217;s Turmeric Protect, which features turmeric oil for better absorption into the bloodstream, containing 70 percent curcumin, a much higher concentration than what would typically be attained through food.<br>
<strong>Top tip:</strong> &#8220;As you shift into your 50s and beyond, it&#8217;s important to eat less overall, cut down on carbs, sugar and animal protein and increase the consumption of plant protein. I also use supplements since it&#8217;s not always possible to get our full nutrients from food consumption alone.&#8221;<br>
<strong>Pandemic survival strategy</strong>: &#8220;Get up from your computer and walk around as much as possible. I also use my foam roller daily to roll out tight areas and do floor stretches to stretch out my hips and back.&#8221;</p>

Heiman, MS, PT, E-RYT 500, is a physical therapist and <a href="https://lytyoga.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creator of LYT Yoga.</a><br>
<strong>Top tip:</strong> &#8220;Remember an activity you did in your earlier years like aerobics, karate &#8212; something that you aren&#8217;t currently doing &#8212; and revisit it. When older folks don&#8217;t move regularly, we put ourselves at higher risk of chronic diseases and weaker muscles and bones, which can lead to an increased risk of falling, depression and a harder time controlling our weight.&#8221;<br>
<strong>Pandemic survival strategy:</strong> &#8220;Just because you are in quarantine doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t move. And do in a way that feels joyful! Dance, scream, laugh and move. It reminds us of being alive and feeling our potential.&#8221;</p>

Berk, DC, is a chiropractor and meditation expert, and runs a self development website.<br>
<strong>Top tip</strong>: &#8220;When we get stressed, we tend to avoid facing our fears head-on, consequently letting this nervous energy persist. Under these circumstances, people tend to put their meditative practice on hold.&#8221;<br>
<strong>Pandemic survival strategy:</strong> &#8220;The most important thing during these times is to give our practice the highest priority each day. Meditation helps create a positive mindset and it is your mindset that determines how you respond to each situation. If you are centered, you will be more creative and more effective in solving each challenge you face. If you are fearful and scattered, there is a great probability you will not choose an optimum response which can make the situation worse.&#8221;</p>

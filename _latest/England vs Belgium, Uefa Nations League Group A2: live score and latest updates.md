Belgium open England up again. Carasco has had the better of Dier, and Belgium have the ball in the net! But what's this... a very, very late offside flag has saved England. "That was beyond ridiculous," says Gary Neville of the delay between offside and flag. It did seem to take an age. Meunier got the ball down the right - if he is offside it's very tight. He crossed, Carasco sold Dier the dummy and slotted it home. Think there was another player in the box, Castagne, who was arguably off but again, very hard to say. No Var in this.

Looking again, Castagne is offside.

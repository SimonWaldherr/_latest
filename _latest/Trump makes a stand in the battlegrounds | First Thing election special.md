<div><p>The president is pouring everything into the swing states that gave him his electoral college victory in 2016. Plus, the growing threat of white supremacist bloodshed</p><p>Good morning,</p>
<p>With just over two weeks to election day, Donald Trump still trails his Democratic rival by double digits in national polls. Just like in 2016, his campaign is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/18/donald-trump-joe-biden-election-nevada-arizona-pennsylvania-north-carolina-covid-coronavirus" class="u-underline">sinking all its efforts into the few battleground states</a> that offer the president a narrow path to an electoral college victory. On Sunday Trump was in Nevada, while on Monday he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/oct/19/donald-trump-joe-biden-coronavirus-covid-19-us-election-live-updates?page=with:block-5f8d59708f08176e64a8ccdf#block-5f8d59708f08176e64a8ccdf" class="u-underline">heads to Arizona</a>, followed by Pennsylvania and North Carolina on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>Four years ago, it was Wisconsin&#8217;s shock swing to Trump that in effect dashed Hillary Clinton&#8217;s hopes on election night. Now, the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis may lead the state &#8211; where infections are rising &#8211; to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/18/trump-wisconsin-economy-election" class="u-underline">swing back into the Democratic column</a>, as Dominic Rushe reports.</p>

<p>At his rally in Nevada, Trump insisted again that the US was &#8220;rounding the turn&#8221; in its fight against the coronavirus. In fact, weekly case averages are rising in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/18/us-coronavirus-cases-surges-most-states" class="u-underline">48 out of 50 states</a>, while Friday had the highest 24-hour infection total in the US since July, with 68,000 new cases. Meanwhile China has become the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/19/china-becomes-first-major-economy-to-recover-from-covid-19-pandemic" class="u-underline">first major economy to recover</a> from the crisis.

<p>Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Viktor Orb&#225;n in Hungary. Around the globe, rightwing populists &#8211; or, as Biden described them last week, &#8220;all the thugs in the world&#8221; &#8211; have expressed support for Trump ahead of the presidential election. A Trump victory would bring such figures <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/18/rightwing-populists-place-their-bets-on-four-more-years-of-trump" class="u-underline">a psychological boost more important than any specific policy benefits</a>, write Shaun Walker and Tom Phillips.</p>
<p>If Biden wins, by contrast, it could be a signal that the world&#8217;s populist moment is over, says Erin Kristin Jenne, a professor of international relations at Central European University:</p>
<blockquote class="quoted">
<p class="inline-garnett-quote inline-icon ">


 </p>
<p>It would be seen as a major failure of populist nationalism as a governing ideology, particularly at a time when societies are looking for competent leaders who can steer their countries through the Covid crisis.</p>

<li><p><strong>Ireland is backing Biden. </strong>The Democrat is vocal about the value he places on his Irish roots, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/18/biden-gets-ireland-why-joe-in-the-oval-office-would-thrill-joe-in-mayo" class="u-underline">Irish believe it could influence his foreign policy</a> in their favour, as Rory Carroll reports.</p></li>

<p>Just days before the FBI arrested six men for plotting to kidnap Whitmer earlier this month, Trump&#8217;s acting secretary of homeland security had expressed concerns about &#8220;white supremacist violent extremists&#8221;. In his department&#8217;s annual assessment of threats to the nation, Chad Wolf said such extremists &#8220;seek to force ideological change in the United States through violence, death, and destruction&#8221;.</p>
<p>Last year was the deadliest on record for domestic extremist violence since the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, with white supremacists responsible for most of the bloodshed. And what makes the current <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/white-supremacist-domestic-terror-threat-looms-large-in-us" class="u-underline">threat level so uniquely dangerous, writes Ed Pilkington, is Trump himself</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="quoted">

<p>Liberals fear a slide into autocracy should Trump win a second term. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/opinion/where-liberal-power-lies.html" class="u-underline">conservatives believe the left has totalitarian tendencies</a>, too, as Ross Douthat writes in the New York Times.</p>

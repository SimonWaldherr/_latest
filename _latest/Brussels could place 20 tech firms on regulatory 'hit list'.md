Brussels is set to add 20 of the world’s biggest tech companies onto a regulatory “hit list”, it has been reported.

European lawmakers plan to impose stricter rules on the giants placed on the list, which is likely to include Facebook and Apple, in a bid to reduce their market power.

The tech behemoths will be forced to abide by tougher regulation that their smaller competitors will evade, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposals the tech giants will also be forced to share data with rivals and be more transparent around how they collect information.

Criteria for inclusion on the list will focus on metrics like a company’s market share of revenues and total number of users, according to the FT. Companies so powerful that rivals cannot compete without using their platforms could also be added to the list, the report said.

It is set to be the latest move by Brussels to clamp down on the tech companies dominating positions in various markets. In February, the European Commission opened a broad probe into the sector more generally.

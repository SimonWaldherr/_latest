"With potential product shortages continuing, if you see something you know you want, go ahead and buy it," Karl Haller, partner and retail industry expert at IBM Global Business Services, advises.</p><p class="p-text">If you've bought anything online the last few months, you've probably experienced shipping delays&#8212;and that's likely a trend that will continue into the holiday season. "We expect to see continued pressure on shipping, as more packages flow through the system. We have already seen some of the major carriers impose fees on package shipping in anticipation of this," Haller&#160;says, adding that IBM also expects further increases in alternative delivery options like buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS),&#160;curbside pick-up, package lockers, etc.&#160;</p><p class="partner-placement partner-spike"></p><p class="p-text">In light of what's predicted to be heavier-than-usual shipping needs this year,&#160;retailers and shipping companies alike are preparing the best way they can.

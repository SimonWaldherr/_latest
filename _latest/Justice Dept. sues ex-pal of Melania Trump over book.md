Copies of "Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady" by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff.

The Justice Department on Tuesday sued a former friend of Melania Trump over the woman’s tome about the first lady.

Author Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an ex-Vogue magazine higher-up and former unpaid adviser to President Trump’s wife, violated a nondisclosure agreement and thus should fork over all of her book’s profits to a government trust, Justice officials said in the federal suit filed in Washington, DC.

The day before Wolkoff’s work, “Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady,” was published in September, Melania’s spokeswoman said, “The book is not only full of mistruths and paranoia, it it is based on some imagined need for revenge.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec, referring to the nondisclosure agreement referenced in the lawsuit, said Tuesday, “This was a contract with the United States and therefore enforceable by the United States.’’

The Trump administration had been threatening to sue over the book, which made the New York Times’ bestseller list, before it was published.

At the time, Wolkoff denied breaking any nondisclosure pact and said she had been working with First Amendment lawyers to ensure that.

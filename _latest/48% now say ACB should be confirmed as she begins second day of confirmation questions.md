While Amy Coney Barrett prepares for a second full-day of grilling from senators on the Judiciary Committee, a new poll released Wednesday morning shows the Supreme Court nominee is gaining popularity.

Nearly half of registered voters believe Barrett should be confirmed, despite a controversial nomination especially in terms of timing.

The Politico/Morning Consult survey shows 48 per cent of American voters want Barrett's confirmation to get through in contrast to a previous poll that showed only 37 per cent felt President Donald Trump should choose the next Supreme Court Justice.

And this survey also shows support from Democrats for her confirmation jumped by 13 points.

Barrett, 48, walked into the first day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Monday with less support for her confirmation than she now holds.

But the poised judge would not be rattled, even as she faced a harsh line of questioning from Democrats Tuesday on her personal beliefs and choices and what her confirmation could mean for crucial cases involving healthcare, abortion and the 2020 election.

Amy Coney Barrett saw a boost in popularity Wednesday morning after facing a full day of grilling from all 22 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday

Arrival: Barrett arrived on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning for her second day of questions as the new poll shows 48 per cent of registered voters feel she should be confirmed

Each of 22 members of the panel delivered opening remarks Monday before swearing in Barrett and hearing her opening statement, where she promised to apply the law as written as the true originalist and textualist she is.

All day Tuesday, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals judge faced questions from each member.

The senators were awarded 30 minutes to interact with Barrett, whether that be through monologuing their time or grilling her on her judicial – and personal – record.

The second and final day of questioning Wednesday will conclude with senators receiving 20 more minutes to interact with Barrett.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham has predicted Barrett's confirmation no later than Tuesday, October 27 – just one before Election Day.

On Monday and Tuesday, Barrett was joined by her large family in the Hart hearing room with her husband Jesse, six of her seven children and her six siblings all sitting behind her for the majority of the two days.

Her youngest son, who has Down Syndrome, remained at home.

While Republicans focused on Barrett's family, faith, as a Roman Catholic, and academic and judicial records, Democrats targeted her on abortion, the Affordable Care Act, and whether she will recuse herself if she is confirmed and the election results end up in front of the Supreme Court.

Barrett refused to commit to anything one way or the other and said it would be inappropriate to say she would recuse herself before looking at the facts of a specific case.

Many Democrats argue Barrett's confirmation should not go through before November 3, claiming the rush job is an insurance policy from Trump for a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court should any election disputes end up there.

They also claim the fast-action comes to make sure she is seated on the court ahead of oral arguments on the ACA beginning November 11 – just days after the election.

If Barrett is confirmed – the most likely course of action with a GOP-majority Senate – Trump will have drastically impacted the makeup of the Supreme Court by placing an unprecedented three justices during his first term.

Most concerning for many progressives is Barrett's view on abortion as a devout Catholic who has publicly shared her pro-life stance in the past.

But the mother of seven has assured her integrity as a judge, and said any personal views would not be reflected in her deciding cases based on her originalist view of the Constitution.

Democrats protest that Barrett could overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which made women's access to a safe and legal abortion the status quo across the nation without excessive government restriction.

Before rolling out new features, developers usually test out these features with a select few users to make sure the implementation is right and the feature works as intended. Until now, YouTube would randomly select users to beta test features. That’s changing now. From now on, only YouTube Premium subscribers will be able to get early access to experimental YouTube features.

As stated on the YouTube experimental features page, “for a limited time, Premium members can try out new features that we’re working on. Share your feedback to help us build a better YouTube.”

At the moment, there are three experimental features that are live for Premium subscribers to test.

The first one is Watch on your Home screen is an iOS-only experimental feature that will let users watch videos with sound and even seek without even leaving the home screen of the application. Currently, YouTube does auto-play videos on the home page but you can’t seek.

The second feature is quite self-explanatory - Voice search on Web. This feature is currently only available on Chrome at the moment.

The last one is Filter by topic in additional languages which will now let users make use of topic filters in Spanish, French, or Portuguese. This feature has only been available for English language until now.

It’s unclear as to why YouTube has moved the experimental features to YouTube Premium. Whether YouTube considers this as being a perk or whether YouTube thinks this will be a better target audience for experiments is anyone’s guess.

YouTube Premium is YouTube’s paid subscription offering that lets users pay a monthly fee in order to get rid of ads from the YouTube application. The subscription also offers features such as background play and offline viewing. The subscription also gives access to YouTube Music Premium.

<p>Morgan Stanley plans to slow hiring into its massive financial advisor training program through the end of this year as remote work has created a less-than-ideal environment for novice advisors getting their start, according to a person familiar with the matter.&#160;</p><p>Those plans come as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/morgan-stanley">Morgan Stanley</a> expects its overall financial headcount to stay relatively flat over the next year to 18 months, the person said, after recently snapping up large financial advisor teams from competitors and booking the first rise in advisors in more than a year.&#160;</p><p>"We've backed off in terms of the number of trainees, and that'll probably last certainly through the end of this year, and we'll see what the new year brings," said the person, who was granted anonymity to discuss the firm's plans freely.</p><p>Hiring into the rigorous, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanley-ubs-merrill-lynch-financial-adviser-training-overview-2020-1">multi-year program</a> at Morgan Stanley typically tapers off at the end of the calendar year, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-pausing-financial-adviser-trainee-interviews-2020-4">other firms</a> have made similar moves.&#160;</p><p>But the pandemic has made training particularly difficult, the person said, since advisors-in-training cannot meet with prospective clients and receive the same in-branch mentoring experience as they usually would. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management can hire as many as one thousand candidates into the program in a given year.&#160;</p><p>The remote work environment this year has impacted other firms' training programs. During the summer, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/merrill-lynch-pauses-adviser-trainee-prospective-client-outreach-after-violations-2020-8">paused its advisor trainees' reach-outs</a> to potential clients after there were outreach-related violations, Business Insider previously reported.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Morgan Stanley's overall hiring has picked up in recent months, poaching large teams of financial advisors from elite wealth management competitors like Bank of America's Merrill Lynch and UBS, according to <a href="https://advisorhub.com/morgan-stanley-hires-merrill-lifer-with-473-mln-book-in-illinois/">recent reports</a> from AdvisorHub, which tracks individual advisors' moves.</p><p>

<p>That increase of 70 advisors from a quarter prior was the largest net addition in nearly five years, Ryan told Business Insider. Financial advisor trainees are counted in the firm's overall financial advisor population, a practice similar to other wealth managers with large training programs.</p><p>The business reported client assets of $2.85 trillion during the third quarter, a rise of 11% from a year ago and 7% from the quarter prior, coming as the markets have recovered losses from earlier this year and shot up to near all-time highs.&#160;&#160;</p><p>"The advisors that we are bringing in are much larger teams than we have had in the past," the person familiar with the matter said, referring to experienced advisor recruits from rival firms.&#160;</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tech-during-the-pandemic-is-changing-financial-adviser-recruiting-2020-6">Wealth managers could save millions in costs from a snappier recruitment process.

<p>Commenting on the US coronavirus strategy, he said that the costs of an expanded testing system are trivial compared to the costs of tens of thousands of early deaths. Summers stated:</p>

<p><i><strong>"Expanding testing should be a matter of utmost urgency,"</strong></i></p>

<p>So far, the U.S. has recorded more than 8.35 million cases, 224,389 deaths, and over five million recoveries from the coronavirus. Confirmed cases in Pakistan have reached 323,452 whereas, 307,409 people have recovered and 6,659 have died from the rampant virus. The government is asking people to cooperate fully by following SOP&#8217;s to the T and maintaining social distancing in order to stop the onslaught of second wave which could wreak havoc again.</p>

  Alice Temperley on moving her brand from London to the Somerset countryside 
description: > 
  The designer, whose trademark gauzy, twinkly evening dresses have been worn by the Middletons (Kate has worn Temperley London 14 times in public), Penelope Cruz and Thandie Newton, has a distinctive, swashbuckling style that’s part Rita Ora, part Pre-Raphaelite muse.Today’s rural look comprises a black beret perched jauntily on her wavy blonde hair, a black midi cape, a bottle-green Lurex midi dress and block-heeled Victorian lace-up boots.Temperley, now 45, grew up in Somerset – her parents own the largest apple orchard in Europe and their company, Somerset Cider, has been squelching apples into alcoholic nectar for decades – but always wanted to work in fashion.Now she wants fashion to work in Somerset, to which end, she’s moving her company headquarters, lock, stock and ecommerce photographic studio to Ilminster (population 5,800).Superficially, this might sound a teeny bit eccentric, particularly for a business named Temperley London.

<div><p>Alice Temperley picks me up from Taunton railway station in the black and white zebra-striped Land Rover that she and her 12-year-old son Fox lovingly painted during lockdown. The designer, whose trademark gauzy, twinkly evening dresses have been worn by the Middletons (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/royals/decoding-duchess-cambridges-casual-autumn-style-formula/">Kate</a> has worn Temperley London 14 times in public), Penelope Cruz and Thandie Newton, has a distinctive, swashbuckling style that&#8217;s part Rita Ora, part Pre-Raphaelite muse. Today&#8217;s rural look comprises a black beret perched jauntily on her wavy blonde hair, a black midi cape, a bottle-green Lurex midi dress and block-heeled Victorian lace-up boots.</p>
<p>Temperley, now 45, grew up in Somerset &#8211; her parents own the largest apple orchard in Europe and their company, Somerset Cider, has been squelching apples into alcoholic nectar for decades &#8211; but always wanted to work in fashion. Now she wants fashion to work in Somerset, to which end, she&#8217;s moving her company headquarters, lock, stock and ecommerce photographic studio to Ilminster (population 5,800).</p>
<p>Superficially, this might sound a teeny bit eccentric, particularly for a business named Temperley London. But bear with, because it could turn out to be a template for others. For one thing, her new 22,000 sq ft, freehold HQ cost roughly the same to buy as one year&#8217;s rent on her quarter-the-size studio in W10, an industrial development in the shadow of Grenfell Tower in west London, also shared by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/designers-releasing-unisex-collections-do-really-fit-womans/">Stella McCartney</a>, Me+Em and Samantha Cameron&#8217;s Cefinn label. For another, it&#8217;s far prettier, with a restaurant opposite serving Michelin-worthy food, which it delivers to her desk, on vintage plates. &#8220;And,&#8221; says Temperley, &#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t believe the community spirit.&#8221;</p>

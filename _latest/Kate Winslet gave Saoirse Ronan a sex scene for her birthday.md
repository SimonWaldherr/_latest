<div><p>She ended her birthday with a bang.</p>
<p>Kate Winslet devised a salacious way to celebrate the 26th birthday of &#8220;Ammonite&#8221; co-star Saoirse Ronan &#8212; by rescheduling the shoot for their steamy sex scene in the flick to coincide with the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wanted her to have, frankly, a great memory in her film life, regardless of how the scene played out or the movie turned out,&#8221; the &#8220;Titanic&#8221; star told <a href="https://ew.com/movies/kate-winslet-ammonite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> of the unorthodox birthday gift.</p>
<p>Winslet, 45, stars opposite Ronan in the Francis Lee directed period piece, which chronicles the lesbian romance between paleontologist Mary Anning (Winslet) and geologist Charlotte Murchison (Ronan) in rigid Victorian England.</p>
<p>In accordance, the &#8220;Sense and Sensibility&#8221; star asked the production team to reschedule the titillating shoot, which was choreographed entirely by Winslet and Ronan without any rehearsals or anything blocked beforehand, EW reported.</p>
<p>Having someone strip to their birthday suit on their b-day might sound unconventional, whether for a movie or not. However, Winslet said she &#8220;knew that it would be [great] just because of the experience that we would share together,&#8221; and reportedly went into the shoot with the knowledge &#8220;that it would be very equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ammonite,&#8221; which also stars Gemma Jones and Fiona Shaw, is being <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/08/26/predictions-op-goldderby-picks-front-runners-for-delayed-2021-oscars/?_ga=2.49734626.556411693.1603278157-1605931416.1601588195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">touted as a front-runner</a> for the much-postponed 2021 Oscars.</p>
<p>Winslet has spoken out before about being protective over younger Hollywood stars, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/kate-winslet-on-her-career" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">telling Vanity Fair in September</a> that she once stayed on set late while filming the upcoming HBO limited series &#8220;Mare of Easttown&#8221; to ensure Angourie Rice, 19, was safe on set during an intimate scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;I actually ended up being in the trunk of the car, screwed up in a little ball, just so they weren&#8217;t alone in the car with two men who, by the way, are completely lovely, respectful, seasoned camera operators,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But still, she was young and it was a potential trigger moment for her. I didn&#8217;t want for her to feel that way.&#8221;</p>

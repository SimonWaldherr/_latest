North Dakota, which is leading the nation in coronavirus cases per capita, reported more than 1,000 cases on Tuesday, the state&#8217;s worst daily total yet. And as of Monday, 16 states had added more cases in the prior week than in any other seven-day stretch.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After weeks of spread and warnings in certain areas, a third surge of coronavirus infections has now firmly taken hold across much of the United States.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The latest wave &#8212; which is raging most acutely in the Midwest and the West, but is also spreading in various areas around the country &#8212; threatens to be the worst of the pandemic yet.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Its arrival comes as cooler weather is forcing people indoors, setting up a grueling winter that will test the discipline of many Americans who have grown weary of wearing masks and turning down invitations to see family and friends. Over the last week, the country has averaged about 59,000 new cases a day, the most since the beginning of August. The daily total could soon surpass 75,687, a record previously set on July 16.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The high case count &#8212; which has so far not translated to soaring deaths &#8212; in part reflects increased testing. With about one million people tested on many days, the country is getting a far more accurate picture of how widely the virus has spread than it did in the spring.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the latest developments also reflect a serious new level of the outbreak. Hospitalizations, the most accurate picture of how many people are seriously sick from the virus, are on the rise nationwide, worrying many public health officials. A rise in deaths tends to lag behind a spike in cases. And deaths are creeping up in places: Officials in Wisconsin reported 36 on Tuesday, a single-day record.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Deaths among hospitalized patients have also dropped, to 7.6 percent from 25.6 percent in the spring, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172775v1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to one study</a>. That may be because doctors have better treatments at hand, and the patients are younger and in better health on average than those in the first wave.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota, recently offered an ominous warning: With infections rising and compliance eroding, he said, &#8220;the next six to 12 weeks are going to be the darkest of the entire pandemic.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sarah-mervosh" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sarah Mervosh</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mitch-smith" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Mitch Smith</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/apoorva-mandavilli" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="the-pandemics-real-toll-300000-deaths-and-its-not-just-from-the-coronavirus"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#the-pandemics-real-toll-300000-deaths-and-its-not-just-from-the-coronavirus">The pandemic&#8217;s real toll? 300,000 deaths, and it&#8217;s not just from the coronavirus.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="The artist Shane Reilly outside his home in Austin, Texas, last month,&#160;updating a memorial  to Texans who have died from Covid-19." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20virus-briefing-death/merlin_176999196_484b930b-fa3f-4a5c-ab19-da5de134f7a7-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The artist Shane Reilly outside his home in Austin, Texas, last month,&#160;updating a memorial  to Texans who have died from Covid-19.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The pandemic has caused nearly 300,000 deaths in the United States through early October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report released Tuesday. The tally includes not only deaths directly caused by the coronavirus but also nearly 100,000 fatalities that are indirectly related but would not have occurred if not for the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm?s_cid=mm6942e2_w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The study</a> is an attempt to measure excess deaths &#8212; fatalities from all causes that statistically exceed those normally occurring in a certain time period.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Many experts believe this measure tracks the pandemic&#8217;s impact more accurately than the case fatality rate. The figure includes deaths from Covid-19 that were misclassified or missed and deaths from emergencies like heart attacks that went untreated because people were afraid to go to the hospital.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Hidden in the new numbers from the C.D.C. is a statistic that may not mean as much as it appears: While the pandemic has taken the greatest toll on older citizens, the biggest percentage increase in excess deaths has occurred among young adults ages 25 to 44, among whom there was a 26.5 percent increase &#8212; as compared with an increase of 14.4 percent in those over 85, a group with a large proportion of the nation&#8217;s excess deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But in nonpandemic times, the death rate among people in that age group is very low, so a disaster such as Covid-19 can easily bump up their death statistics without adding up to large numbers of excess deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Excess deaths among Black people and Hispanics of all age groups also rose compared with previous years, the C.D.C. reports. Hispanics experienced a 54 percent increase, while Black people saw a 33 percent rise.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">By comparison, the increase for white Americans was 12 percent, according to the C.D.C.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/19/2014279117" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Another report,</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, finds that in April nearly half of the nation&#8217;s excess deaths were in New York and New Jersey. A third were in people over age 85.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But excess deaths are only part of the story, noted the authors of that paper, led by Amy Finkelstein, a professor of economics at M.I.T. While deaths last spring were concentrated in New York and New Jersey, the economic ravages from the pandemic extended nationwide, even in states with almost no deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Job losses in New York and New Jersey were just a fraction &#8212; 7 percent &#8212; of job losses throughout the country. And while deaths were concentrated in older people, half of those who lost their jobs nationwide were ages 25 to 44.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Concentrating on case counts or death counts, they conclude, provides only a partial picture of the pandemic&#8217;s devastation.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Health crises concentrated in one part of the country and one age group may have substantial economic spillovers that are felt throughout the rest of the country and on other age groups,&#8221; the authors wrote.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Roni Caryn Rabin</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="cuomo-says-ny-wont-enforce-restrictions-on-three-neighbors-after-confusion-over-quarantine-for-pennsylvania-travelers"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#cuomo-says-ny-wont-enforce-restrictions-on-three-neighbors-after-confusion-over-quarantine-for-pennsylvania-travelers">Cuomo says N.Y. won&#8217;t enforce restrictions on three neighbors, after confusion over quarantine for Pennsylvania travelers.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Diners in Marlboro, N.J., in September.

In a brief aside after Ms. Garvey&#8217;s remarks, the governor said &#8220;Pennsylvania, we have the same basic issue.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">None of the states were on a quarantine list released on Tuesday afternoon by the governor&#8217;s office.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Mr. Cuomo said that all nonessential travel among New York and the three states should be avoided and promised he would issue more guidance on that point on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">New York did add two states to its list on Tuesday: Maryland and Arizona. All told, 40 states and territories are now on the travel advisory list, which Mr. Cuomo referred to as &#8220;really a bizarre outcome&#8221; considering that New York once faced one of the worst outbreaks in the country. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Monday, more than 64,200 new cases and at least 517 new deaths <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">were reported in the United States</a>. Over the past week, there have been an average of 59,269 cases per day, an increase of 34 percent from the average two weeks earlier, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-second-wave.html" title="">fears are growing in New York about a potential second wave</a>. Two weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/nyregion/cuomo-shutdown-coronavirus.html" title="">closed nonessential businesses</a> in parts of Queens and Brooklyn where positivity rates had spiked.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Since late June, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have worked in concert to create a list of states from which travelers to the region are subject to a two-week quarantine.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Essential workers</a> have been exempt from the quarantine since it began in June. Other workers who cross state lines have technically been subject to the advisory, but officials have also said that the quarantine is only required by those who spend at least 24 hours in a state on the list &#8212; which would exclude most commuters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The quarantine was intended to apply to any person arriving from an area with a positivity rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents over a 7-day rolling average or an area with a 10 percent or higher positivity rate over a 7-day rolling average.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">New Jersey has a population of about 8.88 million people, and so anything over an average of about 888 new cases puts the state above that threshold. According to a New York Times database, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html#cases" title="">New Jersey has seen an average of 1,016 cases per day</a> in the past week, an increase of 54 percent from the average two weeks earlier.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For Connecticut, the threshold is around 356, and its daily average in the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/connecticut-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">past week was at 378 cases per day</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Though New York has seen a significant increase in cases in parts of New York City and its suburbs, its overall positivity rate has remained lower than its neighbors. On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo said the daily rate was 1.32 percent statewide, and 2.91 percent in the so-called red zones, areas where he recently imposed severe restrictions as virus hot spots sprang up across the state. Hospitalizations in the state increased by eight, to 942.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that the citywide seven-day average positivity rate was at 1.58 percent.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">An earlier version of this item incorrectly described when more than 64,200 new cases and at least 517 new deaths were reported in the U.S. It was Monday, not Tuesday.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-mckinley" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Jesse McKinley</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-gold" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="massachusetts-study-finds-no-rise-in-suicides-during-pandemic-lockdown"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#massachusetts-study-finds-no-rise-in-suicides-during-pandemic-lockdown">Massachusetts study finds no rise in suicides during pandemic lockdown.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump and other politicians have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/12/white-house-effort-prove-that-staying-home-is-deadly-coronavirus-comes-up-short/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeatedly warned</a> that lockdowns and similar measures could cause at least as much distress as they prevent, in particular by increasing the risk of overdoses and suicides because of economic hardship. But the evidence for that claim is sparse; on Monday, a study posted on Medrxiv, a prepublication site, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215343v1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found that in Massachusetts, the suicide rate</a> during the state&#8217;s lengthy stay-at-home advisory last spring remained steady, neither increasing nor decreasing.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The analysis is being submitted to a journal; it has not yet undergone peer review.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This narrative that longer stay-at-home policies drive suicides doesn&#8217;t bear out,&#8221; said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital in Boston and the lead author of the study. &#8220;At least in a state that had a very long stay-at-home advisory, which, for all intents and purposes, was a shutdown. It was a ghost town here.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Faust led a team of researchers from Harvard and Yale who compared suicide rates from March to May, when the state was largely shut down, with the rates during the same months in 2019, which were in line with previous years. The team adjusted for background trends (U.S. rates have been increasing steadily for many groups since at least 2008) and for the numbers of deaths still under investigation as possible suicides. The rate this spring was unchanged from previous years &#8212; just under one suicide a month per 100,000 people.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Our data are reassuring that an increase in suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home advisory did not occur,&#8221; the authors concluded. &#8220;Moving forward, effective prevention efforts will require comprehensive attention to the full spectrum of mental health services.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benedict-carey" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="all-62-residents-of-a-kansas-nursing-home-caught-the-virus-in-two-weeks"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#all-62-residents-of-a-kansas-nursing-home-caught-the-virus-in-two-weeks">All 62 residents of a Kansas nursing home caught the virus in two weeks.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="The Andbe Home, a privately owned nursing home facility in Norton, Kan., that has announced &#8220;a full Covid outbreak.&#8221;" class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/multimedia/20virus-briefing-kansas/merlin_178803531_b57624c0-3110-4076-94dc-e95df3a01653-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The Andbe Home, a privately owned nursing home facility in Norton, Kan., that has announced &#8220;a full Covid outbreak.&#8221;</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Dana M.

Two weeks later, all 62 residents have become infected, along with at least 12 staff members, and 10 of the residents have died.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That is how hard, and how fast, the virus can hammer the vulnerable in the rural Great Plains and Mountain West, where the pandemic is now raging. States in the region that were little affected in the spring and summer and tended to see the virus as a distant threat now have some of the highest per capita infection rates in the country.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It is with great sadness and concern that I announce that we have a full Covid outbreak in our home, despite the precautions we have been taking since March,&#8221; Megan Mapes, the administrator of the Andbe Home, wrote Friday <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/andbe.home.5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Facebook</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The home has barred all visitors, and residents are isolated in their rooms, Ms. Mapes wrote.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Covid-19 is known to be particularly lethal to adults in their 60s and older who have underlying health conditions, which has put nursing home populations at a higher risk of being infected and dying.

Since then we&#8217;ve been undertaking discussions with local leaders in those parts of the country, which are currently bearing the brunt of the second wave of this epidemic. I don&#8217;t want anybody to think that your actions, our actions, are in vain or the efforts in vain because our collective action across the country has brought the R number well below its natural rate of about 3. As a result, the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in February and March. Informed by the data that we&#8217;ve just seen, I can announce that Greater Manchester will move to the Very High Alert level. That means that pubs and bars must close unless they&#8217;re serving substantial meals. Households can&#8217;t mix indoors or in most outdoor settings.

As a result of this, we can see some evidence that these restrictions have been effective in slowing the growth and spread of the virus. However, as the daily figures show, these restrictions on their own have not been enough to significantly reduce the levels of infection. The government has decided that the evidence of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead is now too strong. Therefore, for a period of six weeks, from midnight on Wednesday night, the entire country will move to Level 5 of the framework for living with Covid-19. Even as the winter comes in, there is hope and there is light. If we pull together over the next six weeks, we will have the opportunity to celebrate Christmas in a meaningful way.

It came just before Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s spokesman <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Drew_Hammill/status/1318659655304941568?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gave an upbeat assessment</a> of talks on Tuesday between her and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, saying they had found &#8220;common ground as they move closer to an agreement.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi had said earlier on Tuesday that she was &#8220;optimistic&#8221; a deal could be reached with the Trump administration in the coming days. But Mr. McConnell&#8217;s remarks underscored the divisions among Republicans that have long hampered a compromise, and which have broken out into an extraordinarily open intraparty feud just two weeks before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Republicans are growing increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump and his team are too eager to reach a multitrillion-dollar agreement and are conceding far too much to the Democrats. They fear that a vote on any large bipartisan stimulus would force colleagues who are up for re-election into a difficult choice of defying the president or alienating their fiscally conservative base by embracing the big-spending bill he has demanded.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senate Republicans were also concerned that any vote on such a package could interfere with the Senate&#8217;s hasty timetable for confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court by early next week. Mr. McConnell said he told the White House he was particularly concerned a deal before then could inject unwanted unpredictability into the schedule, according to the Republicans, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a closed party luncheon.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell made it clear that he knew his counsel was likely to leak, making reference to the possibility that his remarks could appear in the news media, two of the Republicans said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A short time later, outside the hearing room where Republicans met privately, Mr. McConnell told reporters the Senate would consider a broad bipartisan stimulus deal if the White House and Democrats struck one.

The scientists will test gradually increasing doses of virus on up to 90 healthy volunteers from 18 to 30 years old until they reach a level that reliably infects them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Once they have decided on a dose &#8212; potentially by late spring, the government said &#8212; researchers will begin to compare a set of coronavirus vaccine candidates by immunizing people and then deliberately infecting them. The government will decide which vaccines to test, but it has not announced them yet.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is possible that by early next year, some of the vaccine candidates now undergoing trials will have already received approval.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But experts in medical ethics are divided over whether such a study is acceptable, largely because there is no highly effective treatment for Covid-19. The Imperial College London researchers said they would use the antiviral medicine remdesivir, but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/health/Covid-treatments-remdesivir.html" title="">that drug has been found to have only modest benefit</a>.

If the students are moved around within that time, the thinking goes, no one will have had &#8220;close contact&#8221; and be required to stay home if a classmate tests positive.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Greg Upham, the superintendent of the 16,500-student school district, said in an interview that contact tracing had become a huge burden for the district, and administrators were looking for a way to ease the burden when they came up with the movement idea. It was not intended to &#8220;game the system,&#8221; he said, but rather to encourage the staff to be cognizant of the 15-minute window.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In an email to administrators last week, Mr. Upham encouraged staff members to &#8220;whenever possible, disrupt the 15-minute timeline through movement, distancing, and masking.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Infectious disease experts say that moving students around every few minutes is actually more likely to increase transmission of the virus, by exposing more people to an infected student. It will also complicate contact tracing efforts, they said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;That is not an evidence-based practice or sound scientific policy,&#8221; said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who has been supportive of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/coronavirus-schools.html" title="">reopening schools</a> for in-person instruction.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The 15-minute, six-foot definition is a guideline for identifying who might be at greater risk of infection, not a hard-and-fast rule about when it can or cannot happen, Dr. Nuzzo said, adding that a person can certainly become infected in less time or from farther away, especially indoors.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard&#8217;s school of public health, said the 15-minute definition was meant to help contact tracers &#8220;effectively and efficiently identify people with the highest risk and target intervention to them.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Kelly Hornby, principal of Billings West High School, wrote in an email to his staff last week that moving students around every few minutes and then returning them to their original desks would help dissipate airborne droplets containing the coronavirus, to the point &#8220;where the risk of being contaminated is greatly reduced.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Fortune disagreed with that idea. &#8220;The particles that transmit Covid, they hang out in the air, and they spread through the air, and the aerosols can hang out for a very long time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So stirring that air up or moving around from your spot doesn&#8217;t really limit your exposure or risk.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  </p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid5">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid5-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid5"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid5"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="saying-that-the-pandemic-worsens-racial-inequities-san-diego-schools-change-how-they-grade"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#saying-that-the-pandemic-worsens-racial-inequities-san-diego-schools-change-how-they-grade">Saying that the pandemic worsens racial inequities, San Diego schools change how they grade.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="San Diego school employees directed families in cars as they lined up in April to receive computers for remote learning.

But it gained new urgency this fall, as the difficulties of remote learning deepened disparities in student performance.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Only 7.2 percent of white students in San Diego&#8217;s secondary schools received grades of D or F in the last school year, according to district data, compared with 20 percent of Black students, more than 22 percent of Latino students and more than 23 percent of Native American students.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Forty-six percent of the district&#8217;s students overall are Latino, 12 percent are Asian-Pacific Islander, 8 percent are Black and a small proportion are Native American, he said. Two-thirds of the teachers are white.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We focused on becoming an anti-racist school district,&#8221; Mr. Barrera said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The grading change has drawn criticism from some conservatives, who say it diminishes the idea of academic excellence. But Kevin Beiser, a trustee who teaches middle-school math in a nearby district, said standards-based grading is meant to mitigate inequities like teachers conflating behavior with academic achievement, or affluent students having greater access to tutors.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter when you learn how to solve for x in algebra, as long as you learn it before the end of the school year,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-hubler" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-attacks-fauci-again-the-day-after-calling-him-a-disaster"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-attacks-fauci-again-the-day-after-calling-him-a-disaster">Trump attacks Fauci again, the day after calling him a &#8216;disaster.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Dr. Anthony S.

Here&#8217;s the first:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: The COVID Tracking Project, state and local health agencies and hospitals</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As you can see, the number of new virus cases in the U.S. is surging &#8212; and not far from this summer&#8217;s peak. You&#8217;re probably familiar with versions of that blue line. It is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">the most common metric</a> for tracking the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The rising line mostly reflects reality: The virus is surging, especially in the Upper Midwest. Cooler weather is leading to more indoor activity, which often leads to new cases, and many Americans seem <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/us/coronavirus-pandemic-fatigue.html" title="">tired of pandemic restrictions</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But you&#8217;ll notice that the red line on the chart &#8212; the number of Americans currently hospitalized with virus complications &#8212; looks less bad. It has risen lately, but it is not close to its peak.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Why? Partly because the number of virus cases is not actually rising as much as the official case numbers suggest.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That brings us to chart No. 2:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: The COVID Tracking Project</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The U.S. is conducting <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lot more tests</a> than in the summer or spring. More widespread testing means that the official numbers are capturing a larger share of new virus cases than earlier this year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We have probably gotten better at finding cases, as testing capacity has increased, and so we can&#8217;t directly compare the size of the waves based on case counts alone,&#8221; Caitlin Rivers of Johns Hopkins University told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good development.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The third chart also suggests some encouraging news:</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>By The New York Times | Sources: state and local health agencies and hospitals</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Even as case numbers have soared and hospitalizations have risen, deaths have held fairly steady.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That&#8217;s happened as many older people &#8212; who are most vulnerable &#8212; have been careful about avoiding exposure. A greater share of current new cases is among young Americans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The quality of virus treatments is also improving. Remdesivir, dexamethasone and monoclonal antibodies all seem to help, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/dose-covid-related-optimism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as my colleague Donald G. McNeil Jr. points out</a>. Just consider how quickly both President Trump and Chris Christie recovered, despite their age and underlying health risks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The full picture: </strong>There are some silver linings. The statistics on new virus cases that get so much attention are somewhat exaggerating the severity of the current outbreak, because of the rise in testing. And treatments have improved, reducing the death count.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the virus&#8217;s toll has still been horrific &#8212; and worse than in many other countries. More than 220,000 Americans have died, and hundreds of people are still dying every day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The overall situation is also getting worse, as the hospitalization numbers make clear. In some states, hospitals are almost full, and the virus continues to spread. &#8220;I&#8217;m just waiting to see if our community can change our behavior,&#8221; Debra Konitzer, the top health officer in Oconto County, Wis., <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-wisconsin-health-south-dakota-9039f5a16a2efb826dc4c20fae6bc204" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently said</a>. &#8220;Otherwise, I don&#8217;t see the end in sight.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As Donald McNeil says, &#8220;The fall wave has just begun.&#8221;</p><p class="css-j3uhc5"></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="ireland-to-become-the-first-european-country-to-reimpose-a-national-lockdown"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#ireland-to-become-the-first-european-country-to-reimpose-a-national-lockdown">Ireland to become the first European country to reimpose a national lockdown.</a></h2><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</p><p class="css-1ceswkc e1drnplw1"></p><p class="css-mln36k" id="modal-title">transcript</p><p class="css-1701swk">bars</p><p class="css-1t7yl1y">0:00 / 1:01</p><p class="css-og85jy">- 0:00</p><p class="css-1qi8px4">transcript</p><h2 class="css-9wqu2x">Ireland Reimposes National Lockdown</h2><h4 class="css-qsd3hm">Ireland will impose a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus cases with the hope of reopening in time for Christmas.</h4><dl class="css-p98d0w"><dt class="css-xx7kwh"></dt><dd class="css-12tddc8"><p class="css-8hvvyd">In the effort to suppress the virus, we have already introduced what is probably Europe&#8217;s strictest regime. As a result of this, we can see some evidence that these restrictions have been effective in slowing the growth and spread of the virus. However, as the daily figures show, these restrictions on their own have not been enough to significantly reduce the levels of infection. The government has decided that the evidence of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead is now too strong. Therefore, for a period of six weeks, from midnight on Wednesday night, the entire country will move to Level 5 of the framework for living with Covid-19. Even as the winter comes in, there is hope and there is light. If we pull together over the next six weeks, we will have the opportunity to celebrate Christmas in a meaningful way. Every Christmas is important, but this year it is particularly so.</p></dd></dl><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/world/20virus-briefing-ireland-1/20virus-briefing-ireland-1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"><p></p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Ireland will impose a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus cases with the hope of reopening in time for Christmas.</p><p class="css-cch8ym"><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Paul Faith/Agence France-Presse &#8212; Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The government of Ireland announced a six-week lockdown beginning Wednesday night, becoming the first European country to reimpose a national lockdown.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The new measures, announced on Monday, are a dramatic U-turn for the government, which just two weeks ago fell short of imposing the highest level of restrictions despite advice from public health experts.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Micheal Martin, the Taoiseach or leader of the government, said that with coronavirus infections on the rise across Europe and much of the world, Ireland could no longer avoid the strict measures, despite the potentially detrimental impact on the economy. He noted that, while recent restrictions appeared to have stemmed the spread of the virus, &#8220;evidence of a potential grave situation arriving in the weeks ahead is now too strong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;While we have slowed the spread the virus, this has not been enough and further action is required,&#8221; he said in a national address on Monday night.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Under the new restrictions, nonessential shops will be closed and people will be urged to stay at home, with the exception of exercise that must take place no more than three miles from home. Restaurants will be limited to takeout or delivery.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Meeting in private homes or yards will be banned as will larger gatherings &#8212; though there is an exemption for weddings and funerals with strict limitations on numbers. Schools and child-care services will remain open despite the restrictions, a move that Mr. Martin defended as being in the best interest of children.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He encouraged the nation to remain hopeful, even as new restrictions altered lives and livelihoods once again and the days grow shorter, adding that &#8220;even as the winter comes in, there is hope and there is light.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If we pull together over the last six weeks,&#8221; Mr. Martin told the nation, &#8220;we will have the opportunity to celebrate Christmas in a meaningful way.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-specia" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="australia-welcomed-new-zealanders-to-visit-only-two-states-theyre-now-traveling-around-the-country"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#australia-welcomed-new-zealanders-to-visit-only-two-states-theyre-now-traveling-around-the-country">Australia welcomed New Zealanders to visit only two states.

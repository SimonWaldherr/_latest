<div><p>A 13-year-old Georgia boy was gunned down in his front yard by a masked gunman who said nothing in the apparently random and &#8220;senseless&#8221; shooting, relatives and police said.</p>
<p>Brayan Zavala, of Riverdale in Clayton County, was working on a lawn mower with his 16-year-old brother, Jesus, outside their home late Thursday when a suspect in a ski mask, sweater and black pants approached and shot him, the teen&#8217;s sibling <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-shooting-leaves-12-year-old-dead-in-clayton-county/SY7JKGU7KZCDTDC24ZCILFGRMI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shooter didn&#8217;t even say I want your money, or this is a robbery or I&#8217;m assaulting you,&#8221; Jesus recalled. &#8220;He just came, stood there [in] silence and shot my brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brayan, who was set to turn 14 next week, died before police responded at about 9:15 p.m. Thursday, his brother said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bullets passed through him and blood just squirted out of him,&#8221; Jesus continued. &#8220;We tried to stop all the blood but by the time the police got here, it didn&#8217;t seem like he had life or a chance to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gunman drove by the family&#8217;s home and then turned around before getting out and walking up to Brayan with a shotgun, Jesus <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/clayton-county/13-year-old-working-front-yard-killed-drive-by-shooting-family-says/YKFSI645QJCZ5MCRXCOFAQGJBQ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told WSB-TV</a>. The suspect then took off in a Chevy HHR SUV with no plates, the grieving teen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did .. what did he do?&#8221; Jesus asked. &#8220;We were working on a lawnmower, and all of a sudden, my brother is dead &#8230; It&#8217;s not fair. What&#8217;s the reason? Why? I don&#8217;t get it. I don&#8217;t get why this happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two other men were also in the car, a neighbor told WSB-TV.</p>
<p>Investigators have yet to determine any link between Brayan and the gunman, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a Clayton County police officer for over 38 years, very little shocks me,&#8221; Doug Jewett wrote the newspaper. &#8220;But, this brutal, senseless murder has overwhelmed me. I send my prayers to the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>A message seeking comment from a police spokesperson was not immediately returned early Monday.</p>
<p>Police in Clayton County are asking anyone with information about the shooting to contact investigators at (770) 477-4479.</p>
<p>An online fundraiser set up to help offset funeral costs for Brayan has exceeded $22,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been taken from us for no reason,&#8221; the campaign reads. &#8220;At this time, Clayton County police are working to help my family track down the shooter. We have no answers.&#8221;</p>

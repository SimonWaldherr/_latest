Undercover officers can have sex with suspects if their refusal to do so risks blowing their cover, according to official new police guidance.

They must however keep it as short as is possible to “mitigate the threat” of being exposed and report it “immediately” to their senior authorising officer, says the guidance published on Monday by the College of Policing, the national standards-setting body.

The disclosure comes despite a scandal which led to the Metropolitan Police paying out compensation in 2015, and apologising to seven women who were deceived into forming “abusive and manipulative” long-term relationships with undercover officers.

Although the guidance, finalised after consultation, states that relationships with suspects remain banned, it accepts sexual contact and communications may be necessary in order to avoid compromising an undercover operation.

The guidance states: “If an undercover officer engages in an intimate sexual relationship (for example, they perceive an immediate threat to themselves and/or others if they were not to do so), this activity will be restricted to the minimum conduct necessary to mitigate the threat.”

Undercover officers would be expected to record it and report it to their senior officers “immediately”, so that it can be investigated and a decision made whether the operation should continue.

“Referral to oversight and governance bodies must be considered where appropriate,” said the guidance.

Senior officers overseeing the operation are also allowed to authorise “communications of a sexual nature (for example online)” where these are judged “necessary and proportionate” to achieve the “specific operational objectives”.

Any officers authorising such communications must take account of what the guidance describes as “collateral intrusion”.

“Collateral intrusion is the risk of interference with the private or family life of persons who are not the intended subjects of the UCO activity,” said the guidance.

Undercover officers are allowed to send “unauthorised” sexual messages if failure to do so may blow the operation but they are then, again, required to keep them to a minimum, and inform their handlers immediately with an investigation into their behaviour.

The guidance is, however, clear that undercover officers must not enter into an “intimate sexual relationship with those they are deployed to infiltrate and target or encounter during their deployment”.

It added: “Having an intimate sexual relationship must not be used as a tactic by an [undercover officer].”

The move provoked anger from victims. Alison, who was tricked into a five-year relationship with undercover officer Mark Jenner, said there was no evidence anything had changed since the scandal broke.

"At least police guidelines now say these relationships are wrong and shouldn't be happening, but it isn't enough," said Alison.

"The abuses I suffered and more than 30 other women we now know of who had similar experiences must be stopped."

Now a campaigner for Police Spies Out Of Lives, she said intimate relationships by police should be criminalised, and that the College should not provide a loophole for sex with a targets.

"We want this to be made illegal, not legalised," said Alison. "We need legislation that says it's illegal for an officer to have a relationship while using their undercover persona."

She added that together with the Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill (CHIS), which is currently going through Parliament, it gives officers a carte blanche to committ crimes.

"The timing of this as the CHIS bill is being rushed through Parliament goes to a core issue," said Alison. "The law can be warped."

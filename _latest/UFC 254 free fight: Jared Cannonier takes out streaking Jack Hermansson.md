<div><p><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/jared-cannonier">Jared Cannonier</a> proved his top-level credentials at middleweight by derailing the momentum of a surging European contender.</p>
<p>Cannonier faced <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/jack-hermansson">Jack Hermansson</a> in the main event of UFC on ESPN+ 18 in September 2019, where he looked to put a halt to the streaking Swede.</p>
<p>Hermansson was very aggressive from the start, pressing forward and throwing hard leg kicks at Cannonier. He immediately shot in for a takedown, but Cannonier was able to defend and disengage. However, shortly after, Hermansson dragged Cannonier down and took his back, but Cannonier powered his way out of trouble.</p>
<p>Cannonier started to find his rhythm midway through Round 1 and stuffed Hermansson&#8217;s next few takedown attempts. He also enjoyed some success with his own leg kicks.</p>
 
<p>In Round 2, Hermansson came out aggressive once again, but Cannonier was able to perfectly counter a takedown attempt by blasting him with an uppercut that sent him to the canvas. &#8220;The Killa Gorilla&#8221; then unleashed some additional ground strikes to force the referee to intervene and stop the fight.</p>
<p>Cannonier (13-4 MMA, 6-4 UFC) returns Saturday when he takes on Robert Whittaker (21-5 MMA, 12-3 UFC) in the co-main event of UFC 254, which takes place at Flash Forum at Yas Island in Abu Dhabi.</p>

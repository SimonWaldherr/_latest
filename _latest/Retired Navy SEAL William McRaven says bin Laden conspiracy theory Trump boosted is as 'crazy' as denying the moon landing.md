<p>Retired US Navy Adm. William McRaven, the former head of US Special Operations Command, said Tuesday that the Osama bin Laden conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump boosted on Twitter last week was as crazy as denying the moon landing.</p><p>Last Tuesday, Trump retweeted a post from a since-suspended account that was spreading a baseless QAnon conspiracy theory that bin Laden is still alive and that former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden staged his killing and possibly had SEAL Team 6 killed to cover it up.</p><p>Amid significant criticism, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/savannah-guthrie-slams-trump-bin-laden-lie-crazy-uncle-video-2020-10">the president defended his retweet</a> Thursday at a Town Hall led by NBC's Samantha Guthrie, saying it was just a retweet. "That was an opinion of somebody," Trump said. "I'll put it out there. People can decide for themselves."</p><p>McRaven, a former Navy SEAL who oversaw the bin Laden raid, kept his thoughts on the unfounded conspiracy theory to himself <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1318691920986673153">until CNN's Jake Tapper asked him about it Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p>"By being so dismissive, by promoting this crazy conspiracy theory, you really disrespected those guys that went on the mission, and frankly, I'd offer, a lot of people within the special operations and conventional forces that have been fighting this hard war for a long time," he said.</p><p>The president has floated a number of unfounded conspiracy theories and scientifically dubious claims in the past, including during his 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>More <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-calls-for-drug-tests-before-biden-debate">recently</a>, Trump pitched the unsupported idea that his Democratic opponent Joe Biden was taking performance-enhancing drugs in order to get him to the election finish line by November. He has called for Biden to take a drug test.</p><p>McRaven has been a measured but outspoken critic of Trump and his administration.

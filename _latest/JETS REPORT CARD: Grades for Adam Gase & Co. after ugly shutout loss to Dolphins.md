  JETS REPORT CARD: Grades for Adam Gase & Co. after ugly shutout loss to Dolphins 
description: > 
  His decision to trot Sam Ficken out there for a career-long 55-yard field goal attempt while trailing 24-0 with one minute left in the third quarter was ludicrous.Somebody should have notified the HC of the NYJ that a field goal would still make it a three-score deficit.Gase didnâ€™t appear to make any tangible halftime adjustments.His offense looked as lost in the second half (excluding mop-up time) as it did out of the chute.

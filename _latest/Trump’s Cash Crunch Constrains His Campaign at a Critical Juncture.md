  Trump’s Cash Crunch Constrains His Campaign at a Critical Juncture

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Every campaign makes fall ad reservations months in advance and adjusts them as Election Day approaches &#8212; including the Biden campaign,&#8221; said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign&#8217;s communications director, who added that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/politics/trump-ads-biden-election.html" title="">a final $55 million push</a> announced this week with the R.N.C. was &#8220;a 40 percent increase over our initial plans.&#8221;</p><p class="notification-copy">

    <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;The president will have all the resources he needs to win re-election,&#8221; he added.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Top Trump officials are banking on the party&#8217;s investment in door-knocking and ground operations to lift the president, especially after Mr. Biden spent months forgoing such activities because of the pandemic.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">After <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-campaign-fundraising.html" title="">fears of a looming cash crunch first surfaced last month,</a> Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that &#8220;if more money is needed, which I doubt it will be,&#8221; he would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1303368660736598016" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;put it up!&#8221;</a> Yet Mr. Trump has so far donated nothing to his re-election campaign, even as it has spent millions on his private businesses, and some top aides are reluctant to directly request that he dip into his own bank account.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">He is still racing to collect cash. On Thursday, Mr. Trump will headline a fund-raiser with major donors before the final presidential debate in Nashville. He took the trip to California last weekend. And last month he flew to his Bedminster club in New Jersey to collect checks before the September fund-raising deadline, even after a top aide, Hope Hicks, had tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign is not broke. The $63.1 million he had on hand entering October is nearly what Mrs. Clinton had four years ago. The campaign said no loans or deferrals had occurred this time. The problem is that his campaign initially presumed it would have far more money, and Bill Stepien, who replaced Brad Parscale as campaign manager over the summer, has spent recent months imposing cost-control measures to prevent a bigger shortfall.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">And being outspent in the final stretch once again &#8212;&#160;this time as an incumbent &#8212; was part of what the Trump campaign was initially built to avoid. </p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">At the core of the financial troubles for Mr. Trump is what kind of funds his campaign and the party have in the bank. He announced that he entered October with $251 million combined with the party &#8212; seemingly a huge amount. But much of that money is tied up in party accounts and cannot legally be used to fund most core campaign operations. The Biden campaign and party entered October together with $432 million.</p></div>

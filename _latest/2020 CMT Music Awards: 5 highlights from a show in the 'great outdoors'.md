Lean heavily on&#160;young stars, let the fans choose the winners, and if you can&#8217;t put these performers in a traditional venue, don't be afraid to get out there &#8212; literally.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The result was a breezy show (just over two hours) that should stand out among its peers, even if it was lacking in surprises.&#160;</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/entertainment/music/2020/10/22/photos-ashley-mcbryde-performs-2020-cmt-music-awards-nashville/3721667001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Underwood times 22&#160;</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Michael Jordan and the Bulls, Tom Brady with Bill Belichick&#160;&#8212; some dynasties seem unstoppable. Enter: Carrie Underwood at the CMT Music Awards.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Underwood won the fan-voted video of the year honor for "Drinking Alone," her eighth time earning top accolades at the show and seventh since 2010.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Randee St. Nicholas directed the video, for the single off Underwood's 2018 album "Cry Pretty."&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-music-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Underwood, who also won female video of the year at the 2020 program, dedicated the honor to her dogged following.

As she celebrates the 25th anniversary of her debut album, &#8220;The Woman In Me,&#8221; Twain revisited the concept of the &#8220;Boots&#8221; video, where a diner full of good ol&#8217; boys completely ignore her.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">As it's hard to re-create that safely in 2020 (even in Switzerland, we suppose), she did the next best thing &#8211; playing off mannequins in a single shot through the museum. Her co-stars, we must say, did a fantastic job of not caving to her charms.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A few other artists also got inventive and/or into their video concepts. Dan + Shay brought some the set of their &#8220;I Should Probably Go to Bed&#8221; clip; Morgan Wallen surrounded himself in glowing bottles during &#8220;Chasin&#8217; You&#8221;; Luke Combs shotgunned a beer in the midst of &#8220;1, 2 Many&#8221; and Kelsea Ballerini and Halsey hopped on top of a bar for &#8220;The Other Girl.&#8221;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-music-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Swift's return</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The world's top&#160;pop star continues to dip her toes back into country music, this time giving a nod to breakthrough artist of the year, a CMT&#160;Music Award she won in 2007 (for "Tim McGraw," one of six CMT Music Awards for Swift before she exited the format).&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I was honored to win this award 13 years go because it's a vote done by the fans," she said in presenting the 2020 award to Barrett for her smash single "I Hope."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It's the second country music awards show appearance for Swift in as many months; she performed her country radio single "Betty" from the Grand Ole Opry House during the ACM Awards in September.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Swift joined a slew of celebrity presenters&#160;&#8212; including Jessica Chastain, Demi Lovato and&#160;Idina Menzel&#160;&#160;&#8212;&#160;that CMT Music Awards producers remotely tapped for the show. Producers could call on A-list talent who may not have been able to trek to Nashville if the show were delivered live in Bridgestone Arena, as previously planned.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Presenters ranged from Rob Thomas introducing Allen and Cyrus&#160;from an award-covered room to Brandi Carlile praising Morris in a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and Katy Perry ribbing&#160;Bryan, her "American Idol" co-star.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"When CMT asked me about introducing my favorite 'American Idol' co-star, I said, 'Sure I'll do anything for Lionel Richie.' &#8230; and then they had to clear up some confusion," Perry jested.&#160;</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/entertainment/music/2020/10/22/photos-luke-combs-performs-2020-cmt-music-awards-nashville/3721705001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">An inaugural Equal Play Award&#160;</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Last year, Jennifer Nettles stood on an awards show stage and called for more female representation on country music's airwaves. Her efforts were applauded, and now they've&#160;being rewarded.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Nettles received the inaugural CMT Equal Play Award Wednesday night, an award she earned&#160;"for her ongoing advocacy for women and diverse voices in the music industry, as she works tirelessly towards gender parity in country music and beyond," the network said earlier this week.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-music-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Most prominently, Nettles wore an outfit at the 2019 CMA Awards that featured the messages "Equal Play" and "Play our F*@#!n records."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"To my sisters out there who continue to burn the holy fire: I am so proud to be part of this legacy in country music with you and I am so proud of the stories we tell," the Sugarland co-founder said in her acceptance speech. "We have more to do as soon as we can and I can&#8217;t wait to do it all alongside you, holding your hands."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Five years after&#160;"Tomatogate"&#160;&#8212; when a radio consultant famously called female artists "the tomatoes of our salad"&#160;&#8212; the conversation has only grown louder about the lack of women heard on country radio.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">At the start of 2020,&#160;CMT pledged&#160;that 50% of its music video airplay would be dedicated to female artists. As part of its Equal Play campaign,&#160;it commissioned a study that found that female artists accounted for 10% percent of country radio airplay in 2019.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/entertainment/music/2020/10/22/cmt-awards-2020-best-photos-country-music-show/3720471001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

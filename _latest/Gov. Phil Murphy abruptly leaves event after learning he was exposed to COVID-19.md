<div><p>New Jersey&#8217;s governor abruptly ended a news conference Wednesday when he discovered a staffer he&#8217;d been in close proximity to had just tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>About 23 minutes into the conference, held outside at Camden County Community College&#8217;s main campus in Blackwood, Gov. Phil Murphy went to the podium and announced a change in the order of speakers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSCLy2mqnsQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a livestream of the event</a> shows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now why am I saying this? I was just informed by my colleagues that I was in close proximity to someone on Saturday who has just tested positive,&#8221; said Murphy, with a blue surgical mask on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will now unfortunately have to take myself off the field. I can&#8217;t ask President Trump not to come to Bedminster and do a fundraiser and have me sit here,&#8221; the gov continued, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/02/nj-gov-phil-murphy-urges-attendees-of-trumps-bedminster-fundraiser-to-quarantine/">alluding to remarks</a> he made <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/06/new-jersey-probing-trump-bedminster-event-for-skirting-covid-19-rules/">about Trump&#8217;s decision</a> to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/02/how-trump-spent-his-day-before-testing-positive-for-covid-19/">come to the state</a> after he learned he&#8217;d been exposed to the virus by his <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/01/hope-hicks-tests-positive-for-covid-19-after-traveling-with-trump/">close aide Hope Hicks</a>.</p>
<p>Murphy said he has &#8220;no symptoms&#8221; and had tested negative for the bug on Monday, but it was unrelated to the contact he had over the weekend because he &#8220;had no idea&#8221; about it &#8220;until just five minutes ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>The governor and his wife were tested again Wednesday afternoon and both tests came back negative, the Garden State governor&#8217;s communications director Mahen Gunaratna said, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/21/phil-murphy-new-jersey-gov-quarantines-after-possible-covid-exposure/3715309001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to USA Today</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The COVID-positive staffer was later identified as Mike Delamater, his deputy chief of staff for intergovernmental affairs, <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/10/another-senior-staffer-to-nj-gov-phil-murphy-has-tested-positive-for-covid-19.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to NJ.com</a>. Another aide, Daniel Bryan, has also tested positive. Bryan was the one who informed Murphy of Delamater&#8217;s diagnosis at the event earlier in the day, the outlet reported.</p>
<p>Murphy had kidney surgery in March, which could put him at a higher risk for a more serious case of the virus, so he and his wife are taking &#8220;exceedingly cautious&#8221; steps moving forward, Gunaratna said.</p>
<p>The pair will cancel all in-person events through next week and will both take additional tests before venturing out in public again.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s event, which announced $14 million in funding to support workforce development programs, began just after noon when Murphy arrived.</p>
<p>He was spotted mingling closely with attendees before he spoke, but everyone, including the governor, was wearing a mask, <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/10/gov-phil-murphy-abruptly-leaves-nj-event-after-learning-he-had-recent-contact-with-person-who-has-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NJ.com reported</a>.</p>

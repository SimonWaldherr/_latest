Wales will ban entry to people from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus by Friday if Boris Johnson fails to impose UK-wide travel restrictions, First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced.

Mr Drakeford said the action was being taken after the Prime Minister did not reply to two letters requesting he introduce the measure across the UK.

"I have therefore asked for the necessary work to be brought forward, which would allow for devolved powers to be used to prevent people from travelling into Wales from high-prevalence areas of the United Kingdom," he told the Welsh Parliament.

Under regulations being prepared, people living in areas with high levels of coronavirus in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will not be able to travel to Wales.

The new restrictions are planned to come into force at 6pm on Friday.

The Welsh Government's plans will bring people elsewhere in the UK in line with measures currently in place in the 17 areas of Wales under local lockdown restrictions.

Under those rules, people must not enter or leave an affected area without a reasonable excuse such as work or education.

It comes as the UK recorded its highest ever daily total of new coronavirus cases, 19,724, compared to 17,234 on Tuesday.

On October 4 the UK recorded 22,961, however this was ‘artificially high’ due to case reporting backlogs at the time.

  Incans buried elaborately decorated LLAMAS while the animal was still alive 
description: > 
  AdvertisementThe elaborately decorated mummified remains of sacrificial llamas have been uncovered in Peru, and they may have been used by the Inca people to placate the locals after they invaded their land, archaeologists claim.These are the first known 'naturally mummified' remains of llamas, an animal which experts know held great meaning to the Inca people and were often sacrificed.According to the research team there were no obvious signs of slaughter or death when they examined the remains of the decorated llama mummies - suggesting they may have been buried alive.However, this discovery was unique, as the llamas were decorated and appeared to be buried alive, rather than as part of a mass throat cutting sacrifice.The natural mummification process also preserved many of the adornments the llamas were decorated with by those preparing them for sacrifice - including valuable bracelets and string.

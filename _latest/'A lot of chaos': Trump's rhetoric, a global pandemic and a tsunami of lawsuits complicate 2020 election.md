  'A lot of chaos': Trump's rhetoric, a global pandemic and a tsunami of lawsuits complicate 2020 election 
description: > 
  More than 140 years later, the looming chaos of the 2020 presidential race harkens back to the ugliest, most antagonistic presidential election in U.S. history.It is possible that the Supreme Court could weigh in on some of the election results in certain states that ultimately end up deciding the (2020) election.In early October, the Justice Department accused a New Jersey mail carrier of discarding nearly 2,000 pieces of mail, including 99 general election ballots.In September, the Justice Department announced an inquiry into nine discarded mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania has been at the center of multiple litigations, one of which reached the Supreme Court.

But returns from four states that could still hand the presidency to his Republican opponent, Rutherford B. Hayes, were in question.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Both candidates declared victory, and&#160;the dispute dragged on for months. Threats of a civil war loomed. Voter&#160;fraud and intimidation ran rampant. Congress was forced to create an electoral commission that would decide the presidency. Voting along party lines, it declared Hayes the winner by just one electoral vote.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">By the time the country finally had a president, inauguration was just two days away.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It was a violent time,"&#160;said Franita Tolson, an election law expert from the University of Southern California.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">More than 140 years later, the looming chaos of the 2020 presidential race  <strong></strong>harkens back to the ugliest, most antagonistic presidential election in U.S. history.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="A caravan of supporters for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden drive past supporters of President Donald Trump standing on the sidewalk on October 18, 2020 in Miami, Florida."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A tsunami of litigation over election rules is already underway, and analysts expect more in November, as disputes over the legitimacy of mail-in ballots continue to rise. A global pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 people has prompted a record number of Americans to vote by mail, creating at least two nightmare scenarios:&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/10/08/rejected-mail-ballots-projected-major-factor-2020-election/3576714001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Thousands of ballots could be rejected</a>&#160;for various technical reasons, such as allegedly mismatched signatures, and an anxious&#160;country may have to wait weeks for the election results.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-elections-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Stoking the anxiety and deep political divisions is the incumbent candidate himself. Lagging behind Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, President Donald Trump&#160;has relentlessly claimed that massive voter fraud involving mail-in ballots is underway and&#160;has made clear he expects a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, with three of his appointed justices,&#160;to intervene in a disputed election.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Foreign interference:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/21/john-ratcliffe-iran-russia-interfering-presidential-election/3721622001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">DNI John Ratcliffe says Iran, Russia interfering in presidential election</a></p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-elections-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">An abnormal election year:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/10/08/rejected-mail-ballots-projected-major-factor-2020-election/3576714001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">More than 1 million people could lose their vote</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Much of what might&#160;happen depends on how tight the race is.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"If the election is not very close, then I don't think the election is going to get a lot of litigation," said Rick Hansen, an election law expert from the University of California Irvine.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But if it's close, Hansen said, expect a kind of "trench warfare" in several states.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The worst-case scenario, Tolson said, is violence in November as the country waits for days, if not weeks, for the election results.&#160;In an era polarized politics and high-stakes election, a losing party&#8217;s refusal to acquiesce, although legally meaningless, could lead to civil unrest, she said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Law enforcement agencies prepare:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/08/election-2020-law-enforcement-bracing-election-related-conflict/5923168002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Foiled kidnapping of Michigan governor highlights fears of election-related conflict</a></p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Already, law enforcement agencies have sounded the alarm.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Threats of anti-government sentiment, civil unrest and disinformation "will begin to converge with the presidential election in November in a manner not previously experienced by our nation," Jared Maples,&#160;chief of New Jersey's Homeland Security Preparedness office <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/08/election-2020-law-enforcement-bracing-election-related-conflict/5923168002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">warned</a>&#160;last month.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The best course for the country is to accept that election results will be delayed and to&#160;let the process play out, said Penn State Harrisburg public policy professor Daniel Mallinson.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"There's nothing we can do about the president and his rhetoric," he said. "We need to cultivate this norm that we very well may not know who the president is on Election Night, and that's OK."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">2020 could be worse than 2000</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The tense recount in Florida in 2000, when the Supreme Court ultimately decided the close race between President George W. Bush and Al Gore, has recently found its way back to national headlines,&#160;as pundits and political writers tried to find a modern-day comparison&#160;to the looming chaos of the 2020 presidential election.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Texas Gov. George W. Bush greets Vice President Al Gore at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 17, 2000."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But comparing the two is difficult, and 2020&#160;&#8211; depending on how close the race is in critical battleground states &#8211; could be worse and will put the country's archaic election infrastructure to the test, experts say.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"2000 is unusual because people felt like the Supreme Court decided the election. It is possible that the Supreme Court could weigh in on some of the election results in certain states that ultimately end up deciding the (2020) election. It is comparable in that sense," Tolson said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For the Supreme Court to be involved in deciding the next presidential election, it would have to be so close&#160;&#8211; a difference of only a few thousand ballots &#8211;&#160;in swing states, Hansen said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The odds of that happening &#8230; is small," Hansen said, but added it should still be a concern.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The issues on the ground are also different.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In 2000, tensions&#160;didn't begin until after Election Day, when it became clear that the race was too close to call in Florida, Hansen said. The 2020 presidential race is facing dueling controversies that are already underway and could stretch for days, if not weeks, after Nov. 3.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-elections-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Transfer of power</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The 2020 candidates are also very different from Gore and Bush. &#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Whether Trump will accept the result of the election if he loses is a question hanging over the ongoing controversies and looming legal disputes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After repeatedly refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, Trump said during a townhall last week that he will accept the results if he is defeated. But the president continued to raise doubts about the election process, claiming that "thousands of ballots" have been dumped.</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While there have been instances of dumping ballots, the incidents are&#160;far from the scale or the massive conspiracy the president suggests.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In early October, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/07/usps-worker-charged-after-nj-ballots-found-in-trash/5917124002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">accused</a> a New Jersey mail carrier of discarding nearly 2,000 pieces of mail, including 99 general election ballots.

In the presidential primary in June, hundreds of voters neglected to put their ballots inside the secrecy envelopes. Some counties, like Philadelphia, accepted the so-called "naked ballots," while others rejected them.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In September, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided that "naked ballots" will not be counted, causing an alarm among election officials&#160;over the possibility that thousands of votes will not be counted in one of the most consequential&#160;battleground states.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-elections-7" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The decision&#160;prompted Democrats <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2-J9pDZeE&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">to launch digital ads</a> educating voters on how to vote by mail in Pennsylvania.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Will that be enough?"

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Ireland will be plunged into one of Europe's strictest lockdowns for six weeks from midnight on Wednesday, despite no new Covid-19 deaths being recorded today.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cabinet ministers have agreed to impose Level 5 restrictions which will force most businesses to close, prevent mass gatherings and limit free movement across the Republic until December 1.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The public will be told to stay at home, with exercise permitted within a 5km radius of their home.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gatherings except for groups of 10 at funerals and 25 at weddings will be banned, and only essential shops will be allowed to stay open.&#160;Construction will be permitted,&#160;but pubs, restaurants and cafes will only be able to provide takeaways and deliveries.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Taoiseach said the Government was introducing Level 5 restrictions for the entire country because 'the evidence of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead was now too strong'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Micheal Martin said schools and creches would remain open because 'we cannot and will not allow our children and young people's futures to be another victim of this disease'.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">During a press conference after his address, Mr Martin defended the Government's decision not to move to level 5 sooner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said they "weren't ready two weeks ago to go to level 5" and that he expected that the country would be dealing with Covid-19 for the "entirety of 2021".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">"The Budget itself was an important set of measures that would enable us to get through this over the medium term, well beyond the next six months because I think we're going to have Covid-19 with us for the entirety of 2021," he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Public health officials yesterday recommended moving to Level 5 for six weeks. It was the second time in a fortnight they had advised the Government to move to the highest level of measures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Government did not heed the previous advice. Instead they placed the entire country into Level 3 restrictions. Currently counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan are at Level 4, while the rest of the country is at Level 3.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Political leaders received briefings from health officials in Dublin on Saturday about their concerns over the recent rapid spread of the virus.

But Cabinet will have to decide that.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Green Party leader Mr Ryan said he hoped the decisions reached today would give clarity to the public.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'I hope there can be because that's the important part of it. The Tanaiste put it right the other day, you need a series of indicators, but that will be for Cabinet to decide. '</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also defended the length of time Government has taken to act on Nphet's advice to move to level five restrictions for six weeks, which were delivered to Health Minster Stephen Donnelly on Thursday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think it's getting things right. It's complicated, there's a huge amount of implications for people's everyday lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think it's appropriate that we try and get the arrangements and the details right in that time.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said that social supports must be put in place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She also called for the cuts to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) to be fully restored.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms McDonald told RTE's Morning Ireland that changes to the restrictions must be 'balanced' and clearly communicated because people were going to 'really struggle' and would be 'worried sick' by any new restrictions.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) and&#160;Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan last week urged the government to bring in the Level 5 restrictions for a six week period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan are at Level 4, while the rest of the country is at Level 3.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Sunday, it was reported that a new lockdown would last for four weeks, but it has since emerged that ministers are being asked to back six weeks.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gaelic games, horse and greyhound racing are still permitted behind closed doors, under the Level 5 rules.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Non-contact sports training for children and young people can continue outdoors but only in pods of 15.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Labour chief&#160;warned failure to act now would mean 'more people will die' as he said households will be banned from mixing indoors and outdoors while exercise outside will be allowed but it must 'begin and end at home'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Primary schools will reopen after half-term next week but secondaries will only reopen years seven and eight, and for pupils doing exams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The decision to impose a 'short and deep' lockdown until November 9, which echoes national demands made by Sir Keir Starmer and wipes out Halloween and Bonfire Night, has sparked a furious political backlash after statistics suggested Wales has a lower coronavirus infection rate than England.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 'firebreak' step was criticised by Welsh Tories, who said it was dooming Wales to an endless cycle of two-week lockdowns while Conservative MPs in Westminster said it was a 'blunt instrument' and 'closing down the whole of Wales is disproportionate to the level of risk in some parts of the country'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also lashed out at Mr Drakeford, accusing him of 'small man syndrome', with one MP telling MailOnline: 'You have got somebody who is the head of what is essentially smaller than the West Midlands but where they have got a mayor, Wales has a first minister.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He is trying to show he is an equal to Boris Johnson.

Ministers have sent an ultimatum to the area's Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, and mutinous MPs that they must do a deal on today - or face being forced into the tougher curbs as early as tomorrow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick warned that talks had gone on 'too long' and urged the region to accept a package of funding worth up to &#163;100million.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downing Street attempted to pile pressure on the Mancunian rebels today by warning that the region's&#160;hospitals are on track to be overwhelmed by October 28 unless the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Hancock told MPs in the Commons this afternoon:&#160;&#160;'Following the successful introduction of measures in Liverpool and Lancashire, talks are continuing this afternoon led by (the Communities Secretary) with Greater Manchester, and this week further discussions are planned with South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, the North East and Teesside.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But along with the war of words with Mr Burnham and Labour, the row is also at risk of tearing the Conservative Party apart - as local MPs including 1922 committee chair Sir Graham Brady dismiss the need for the highest levels of restrictions.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a brutal response from 'Red Wall' MPs on Tory WhatsApp groups after colleagues from Tier One sent a letter to Mr Burnham urging him to 'engage' with the Government's regional approach in order to spare other areas 'pain'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The intervention - which many believe was orchestrated by Downing Street - sparked furious private rows about an 'all-round shafting', with one MP reportedly jibing at another: 'You just want a promotion and you're happy to throw colleagues under a bus to achieve it.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tonight a government spokeswoman said the latest meeting had ended.&#160;'Disappointingly, we have still not been able to reach an agreement.

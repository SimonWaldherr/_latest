Since our launch in 1986, The Independent has always put international affairs at the heart of its journalism. Whether reporting on the Iraq war, documenting environmental issues in India or charting the highs and lows of US presidents since the Reagan era, the title has applied the same values and principles that shaped its beginnings in London: independence from political pressure or commercial interference, and the fearlessness to report truthfully whatever the consequences.

We are proud to be working with other publishers to bring these values to readers around the world in languages beyond English. Many of these sites are operated in partnership, by licencing our masthead and translating our journalism; and all our associates – and the journalists they employ – adhere to the guiding principles and code of conduct that we hold dear.

It's almost as if that spendthrift summer of 2016 scared the NBA straight.

For many teams, it's almost impossible to find deals so bad they'd want them erased from existence. Caution has reduced the frequency of catastrophic contracts, but it hasn't eliminated them entirely.

Key among the parameters here: With one loophole exception, we're going to shy away from rookie deals. No matter how bad those might seem, they're almost always cheap, inherently laden with upside and defined by extreme team control.

In addition, we have to consider a player's health, which will sometimes seem cruel. Coldly, injuries can and do prevent talent from contributing at full capacity. We have to treat those situations honestly.

In order to come up with a contract bad enough for every team, we also had to consider players currently collecting checks while not technically playing for the organization writing them. If the idea here is to isolate the least team-friendly contracts out there, we have no choice but to consider the ones that were so bad that teams literally paid money to put them out of sight and out of mind.

Finally, an overarching message: Get yours, players. We can never emphasize enough that a player's inclusion here isn't a personal knock. If a guy is overpaid, he (and his agent) succeeded. We should all hope to earn more than we're worth.

This exercise operates exclusively from the team's perspective, where the goal is to sign players for far less than they deserve.

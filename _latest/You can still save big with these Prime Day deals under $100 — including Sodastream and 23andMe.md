If you've got a couple of Benjamins burning a hole in your pocket, and you want to be sure to spend them wisely, you've come to the right place. A hundred bucks goes a long way during Amazon Prime Day with small appliances, smart home devices, and ereaders leading the pack of relatively affordable deals.

We're seeing the Kindle Paperwhite at its lowest price ever of $79.99, down from its usual $129.99. We've also found deals on Ring Doorbells and Fire TV Cubes. But it's not just tech that's dipping below the $100 mark — Le Creuset griddles are also available on the cheap.

In fact, we've got sub-$100 deals in every category, so we've broken them down by topic below.

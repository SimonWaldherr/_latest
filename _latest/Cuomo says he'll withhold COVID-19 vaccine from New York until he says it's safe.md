  Cuomo says he'll withhold COVID-19 vaccine from New York until he says it's safe 
description: > 
  'The Task Force will advise on the vaccine safety profile, legal authority to withhold vaccine, and clinical best practices if New York State must withhold or pause distribution of the vaccine.'Once New Yorkâ€™s independent Clinical Advisory Task Force has advised that a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, the vaccine will be distributed and administered throughout New York State,' the plan reads.'You're going to say, "here's a vaccine it was new, done quickly but trust this administration that it's safe?"'But I believe all across the country, you're going to need someone other than this FDA and CDC saying it's safe,' Cuomo said.His 'task force' of doctors is made up of seven New York doctors, some of whom are academics and some are practicing physicians.

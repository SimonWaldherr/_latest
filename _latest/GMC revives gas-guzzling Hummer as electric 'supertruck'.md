<p>It may seem like an oxymoron that the massive, gas-guzzling GMC Hummer, once known as a symbol of overconsumption and excess, is back as a zero-emission, battery-powered electric car.&#160;</p>
<p>But that's exactly what happened on Tuesday evening when the electrified Hummer was revealed through a video streamed on YouTube (you can watch it above). The hulking mass of an EV is supposed to reach up to 350 miles on a single charge and go from 0 to 60 in approximately three seconds.&#160;</p>
<p>The supertruck (it's part SUV, part pickup) was first officially <a href="https://mashable.com/article/electric-hummer/">teased back in January</a> and <a href="https://me.mashable.com/mobility/8941/lebron-james-teases-electric-hummer-in-quiet-super-bowl-ad">NBA star LeBron James</a> starred in a series of ads during the Super Bowl. He was back Tuesday to narrate the start of the video reveal, which featured the truck bursting through the snowy tundra, climbing up desert rocks, and other intense, rugged scenes.</p>

</p><p>Originally based on military Humvees, General Motors discontinued the brand Hummer in 2010. In the past nine months since its revival was announced as an upcoming electric option, little was shared about the performance, design, or look of the revamped vehicle.&#160;</p>
<p>Now we know a lot more about its features, range, and price. The Edition 1 version will be the most costly at $112,595 for a triple motor, fast-charging with 100 miles added in 10 minutes, long range over 350 miles, a glass infinity roof, and open-air design. It has 1,000 horsepower and 11,500 pound-feet of torque.</p>
<p>The next version is the 3X for $99,995 with more limited features and capabilities, like a range of only 300 miles. Then it's the 2X with only two motors for $89,995, followed by the base version with 250-mile range for $79,995.</p>

</p><p>In the five-minute video, Hummer shows the car's "ultravision" which displays 18 different camera views of the car onto the digital display, "extract mode" to lift the vehicle 6 inches to traverse over boulders and whatnot; and also the much-hyped "crabwalk" feature that lets the car maneuver diagonally. (You can see this at around 2:45 in the video up top.) The EV will also have <a href="https://me.mashable.com/mobility/8879/gms-newest-super-cruise-feature-almost-makes-it-a-true-tesla-autopilot-rival">Super Cruise</a>, GM's hands-free driving system for highway driving across the U.S. and Canada.</p>

An indelible event

Back in Alaska after the march, Nosakhere wrote a column declaring, “I was blessed to witness what countless others have died to promote: a display of perfect unity among African Americans.”

In retrospect, he believes the march bumped Black activism for a few years, but he doesn't see it as transformative.

Nosakhere, now 46, accepts a Nation of Islam precept that says only 5% of people know truth and try to make the world better. Counting himself among the “Five Percenters,” he devoted his life to activism.

Killibrew, the ex-con turned poet, was mesmerized but not galvanized. The overpowering emotions of the Million Man March turned out to be a “sugar high,” he says, with no apparent follow-through on the glorious rhetoric.

“Everybody went back to what they were doing,” he says.

Including him. He made $700 selling poems that day, then returned to his rounds in Chicago. Even a poem inspired by the march was lost years ago.

Killebrew has retired from street sales. But he’s still writing, and he's looking to publish an epic poem for kids about the African slave trade.

Ruff, the son of a New York cop, is preparing to retire from the Army Reserve as a sergeant major.

One of the themes of the speeches at the march has stuck with him.

“In this vast audience,” Farrakhan asked, “is there any one, two, 10, 25, a hundred, a thousand, 25,000, who would be willing to adopt a Black brother or sister, bring them into your home and rear them properly? … Would you just raise your hand? Let me take a look. Raise them high.”

Ruff and his first wife signed up for foster care. Three brothers arrived with their belongings in garbage bags. For 10 months, the couple squeezed them into their three-bedroom home and relied on Ruff’s mother-in-law to help with childcare. When the boys were reunited with their biological parent, it was tough. “You become a big part of their life, but even more so, they become a bigger part of your life.”

During 35 years in the Army, Ruff was deployed three times, to Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. He sometimes compared the nation-building in those countries with the struggles of Black men in America.

"We’re helping others to achieve full freedom within their own countries,” he said. “You can’t help but think about it, because of the contradictions. The things we do for others that we don’t seem to want to do for ourselves.”

Ruff never had children of his own. Now remarried, he says he’s thinking about that vow again.

Stokes introduced a resolution this year to name a street in Jackson after George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pinned his neck to the ground.

“Because of the death of Mr. Floyd, people’s hearts changed enough that Mississippi got rid of the Confederate flag,” Stokes says, referring to the former state flag with the Confederate emblem in the design. “I’m talking about some die-hard racists.”

Progress may be slow, Stokes adds, but there has been change. He tells his grandkids about the march — not just how it affected those who attended, but folks they touched afterward.

“Every time Black people get out there and unite and do something positive,” he says, “it helps the people at the bottom. And when it helps the people on the bottom it has a ripple effect.”

Hicks has retired from his post in the Black Studies Department at the public library in Washington.

For him, Oct. 16, 1995, will always be triumphant. Family members near the stage, including his father, didn’t know he was scheduled to speak. When the announcer called his name, Hicks recalls, “It was like I had given them a million dollars. … There will probably never be anything as exciting as that.”

In the years since, Hicks pushed to make the District of Columbia a state. He founded a support organization for Black victims of AIDS. He started an annual gospel concert featuring African American men.

This year, on Father’s Day, he organized a Black Fathers Matter motorcade. About 90 cars, decked out with balloons and signs, cruised from the African American Civil War Museum through Black neighborhoods.

From the days of slavery through today, Hicks says, Black men have been targets: “We’ve been lynched. We’ve been castrated. We’ve been killed. We’ve been imprisoned. We’ve been discriminated against. We’ve been denied jobs.

“So it’s important on Father’s Day that we say to Black men that you matter.”

In fact, the whole thing seemed a bit anticlimactic, given the build up of dire warning and alarm over what, they all kept saying, was a nationwide crisis.

The warm-up act earlier in the day by the deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam was particularly explicit on this point: it was not only the North that was seeing a rise in case numbers and he had graphics to prove it.

His “heat maps” showed that the dreaded increases were spreading rapidly into the South as well, so nobody would escape. In fact, those heat maps, if you looked at them without the soundtrack of doom from the scientific advisers, showed a great disparity between the numbers in the North and the South. In the South East, London and the South West, the increases were almost negligible by comparison to the North West.

There was a recurrent theme that ran through the statement in the House and the press briefing in the evening: what the government was determined to do was take a reasonable centre path – a middle way between the extreme positions that were on offer on both sides of the public discourse.

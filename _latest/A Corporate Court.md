  A Corporate Court

  It was a preview of just how aggressive a Supreme Court with Barrett may be.To these activists — the most famous being the Koch family — the overriding goal is reducing corporate regulations and taxes.The Supreme Court and lower courts have made it harder for labor unions to organize, harder for consumers and workers to fight corporate fraud and easier for wealthy Americans to give millions of dollars in campaign donations, often secretly.These rulings are one reason that the incomes of the very rich have risen so much faster in recent decades than incomes of the middle class and poor.She would be the sixth Republican-appointed justice, which means one of them could defect and the court could still rule against regulation or taxation.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">It was a preview of just how aggressive a Supreme Court with Barrett may be.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">A struggle for power: </strong>Much of the discussion about Barrett&#8217;s nomination has focused on social issues, like abortion, guns and same-sex marriage. They&#8217;re all important, obviously. But they are not the issues that animate many activists and wealthy campaign donors who have spent decades pushing for a conservative overhaul of the courts.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">To these activists &#8212; the most famous being the Koch family &#8212; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/122645/rehabilitationists-libertarian-movement-undo-new-deal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the overriding goal</a> is reducing corporate regulations and taxes. As Charles Koch <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/opinion/charles-koch-amy-coney-barrett.html" title="">said in one speech</a>, he wants to stop &#8220;confiscatory taxation,&#8221; &#8220;safety and health regulations,&#8221; &#8220;trade barriers,&#8221; &#8220;so-called equal opportunity requirements&#8221; and &#8220;many more interventions.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Koch gave that speech in 1974, and in the almost five decades since, the conservative judicial project has made <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/business/pro-business-decisions-are-defining-this-supreme-court.html" title="">a lot of progress</a>. The Supreme Court and lower courts have made it harder for labor unions to organize, harder for consumers and workers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.npr.org/2015/11/12/455749456/have-we-lost-a-constitutional-right-in-the-fine-print" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to fight corporate fraud</a> and easier for wealthy Americans to give millions of dollars in campaign donations, often secretly.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">These rulings are one reason that the incomes of the very rich have risen <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/opinion/income-inequality-upper-middle-class.html" title="">so much faster</a> in recent decades than incomes of the middle class and poor. &#8220;For the past half-century, the Court has been drawing up plans for a more economically unequal nation,&#8221; Adam Cohen, a former member of the Times editorial board, wrote in his recent book, &#8220;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/546351/supreme-inequality-by-adam-cohen/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supreme Inequality</a>.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Barrett&#8217;s answers suggest she may make the court even friendlier to big companies. She would be the sixth Republican-appointed justice, which means one of them could defect and the court could still rule against regulation or taxation.</p></div>

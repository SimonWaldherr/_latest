<div><p>Last year, at a<strong>&#160;</strong>private&#160;school fundraiser, Clinton Baptiste gave a live psychic reading that ended as fans of Phoenix Nights might expect: with Baptiste scarpering from a furious member of the audience. In this particular case, a Frenchman named Pascal. In front of 500 people, Baptiste passed a message to Pascal from the other side.&#160;&#8220;Someone called Dave says you&#8217;re a c&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;.&#8221; As Clinton Baptiste always says: &#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot the messenger, I&#8217;m only telling you what the spirits are telling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clinton Baptiste, of course, is a real&#160;fake&#160;&#8211; a comedy psychic, medium, and clairvoyant played by Alex Lowe. The character<strong>&#160;</strong>first appeared in the noughties sitcom <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/birth-brian-potter-peter-kay-made-phoenix-nights/">Phoenix Nights</a>, one of many disastrous cabaret acts to come through the doors of Peter Kay&#8217;s fictional working men&#8217;s club. But on this particular occasion, Lowe himself&#160;walked back out the doors with a busted nose, after delivering one insult too many from the celestial realm. Clinton has since been resurrected for a live act and podcast &#8211; the Paranormal Podcast &#8211; which is currently in its third series and releases new episodes every Wednesday. But as Clinton might say himself, the spirit of that Phoenix Nights debut is very strong.&#160;The school&#160;incident was a case of life imitating art.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the knockabout style of Clinton you assume everyone&#8217;s on board,&#8221; says Alex Lowe. &#8220;When you&#8217;re up and down the country on tour, the English sensibility gets it. But there&#8217;s a difference between doing it in the north west &#8211; where Phoenix Nights is god-like and people know it inside and out &#8211; and going to the home counties and doing it with a French bloke.&#160;He chased me down a corridor and tried to kill me. He had to be rugby tackled by my agent and James Gill, the compere. At the time I was laughing because it was so ridiculous. I had PTSD a few days later. You&#8217;re slightly taking your life in your own hands doing some&#160;of the stuff&#160;I do as Clinton&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Lowe, 52, was a child actor. As a teenager, he appeared in BBC&#8217;s Mansfield Park, and had an early association with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kenneth-branagh-interview-true-would-have-balked-shakespeare/">Kenneth Branagh</a>. Lowe was Branagh&#8217;s stand-in and&#160;performed in the Renaissance Theatre. He also had supporting roles in Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing and Peter&#8217;s Friends (&#8220;I played a woodchopper who had it off with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/emma-thompson/">Emma Thompson</a>,&#8221; says Lowe).&#160;Now, Lowe is best known as a comedy actor. &#8220;It's sort of where my passion lay all along,&#8221;&#160;he tells me.&#160;</p>
<p>His many comedy credits&#160;include The 11 O'Clock Show&#160;(&#8220;I was on between <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/05/24/sacha-baron-cohen-best-jokes-and-lines/ali-g2/">Ali G</a> and<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ricky-gervais/"> Ricky Gervais</a>&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what happened to those two&#8221;), Fun at the Funeral Parlour, and Sam Delaney's News Thing. To some fans he's best known as dithering octogenarian 'Barry from Watford', who was a comedy caller on radio&#160;and grew into his own act, with live shows and a long-running podcast partnership with Angelos Epithemiou (<a href="http://-white-male-privilege-became-britains//">Dan Skinner</a>). Lowe describes it as &#8220;a bit like Derek and Clive but not quite as crude.&#8221;</p>

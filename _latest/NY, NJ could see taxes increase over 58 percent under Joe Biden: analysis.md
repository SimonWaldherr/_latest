<div><p>High earners in New York and New Jersey could see federal and state tax rates of more than 58 percent under former Vice President Joe Biden&#8217;s tax proposals, according to an analysis of the plan.</p>
<p>While Biden would slice taxes for Americans earning under $400,000, those making more than that would face double-digit increases, the Washington, DC,-based <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/joe-biden-tax-plan-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax Foundation found</a>.</p>
<p>The Empire State could see a 58.2 percent increase, while New Jersey&#8217;s would rise to slightly more than 60 percent and California would hit 62 percent, according to an analysis by Jared Walczak of the Tax Foundation.</p>
<p>In the Big Apple, city, state and federal taxes would rise to more than 62 percent.</p>
<p>The Tax Foundation noted that although the US&#8217; statutory tax rate is 37 percent for those in the highest tax brackets, they usually pay 26.8 percent after taking advantage of deductions and loopholes in the tax laws.</p>
<p>The Biden administration, with the help of a Democratic-controlled Congress, could remove the $10,000 cap on state and local deductions, helping to lower the tax rates of the higher earners.</p>
<p>By 2030, the analysis found that Biden&#8217;s tax plan would lead to a 6.5 percent less-after-tax income for the top 1 percent of taxpayers and a 1.7 percent decline in after-tax income for all taxpayers.</p>
<p>It also found his proposals would raise federal tax revenue by $3.05 trillion over the next decade but reduce the Gross Domestic Product by 1.47 percent over the long term.</p>
<p>Besides raising taxes on those making above $400,000, Biden would increase the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 percent and increase a minimum tax for corporations earning profits of $100 million or higher.</p>

<div><p>Wednesday&#8217;s edition of &#8220;The Michael Kay Show&#8221; was a real snoozefest for this fan.</p>
<p>A caller named &#8220;O&#8221; from New Jersey was fast asleep, snoring loudly on the other end of the line when Kay said the person was on the air. Kay&#8217;s ESPN Radio co-host Don La Greca begins laughing in disbelief as the crew, which includes Peter Rosenberg, waits to see if the caller will wake up. The caller apparently wanted to discuss if Antonio Brown has learned his lesson as his NFL suspension is set to end.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question I have here is, is this an indictment of the caller or the show?&#8221; Rosenberg wondered in a YES Network clip <a href="https://twitter.com/BackAftaThis/status/1319108560651956225" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared by Funhouse on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Kay said the caller was on hold for &#8220;maybe 20 minutes&#8221; before getting on, and Kay shouts &#8220;O!&#8221; in an effort to stir the caller from their slumber. Rosenberg also made futile shouting attempts.</p>
<p>La Greca then speculates that the caller was high.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, we&#8217;re in that 4 o&#8217;clock hour Peter, right? That&#8217;s where that a lot of the guys that partake that listen to this show&#8230;he probably was done with his munchies and took a nap,&#8221; La Greca said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you don&#8217;t think this is an older gentleman, Don, you think this is a young, high gentleman?&#8221; Rosenberg asks La Greca.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; La Greca responds.</p>
<p>After briefly putting the caller back on hold, they bring the caller back on air only to hear more snoring.</p>
<p>Assuming this wasn&#8217;t some peculiar prank by the caller, maybe the person just needed a mid-afternoon nap. Though no radio host wants to put its listeners to sleep, it&#8217;s better than <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/mike-francesa-appears-to-fall-asleep-again-on-air/">a host taking a mid-show snooze</a>.</p>

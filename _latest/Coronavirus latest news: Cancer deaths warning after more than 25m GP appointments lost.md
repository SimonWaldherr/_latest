The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said access to family doctors remains worse than it was before lockdown, raising concerns that people with worrying health problems were struggling to see a physician.

Cancer Research UK said that, since March, more than 350,000 people who would normally have been urgently referred to hospital with suspected cancer have not been.

<div><p><a href="https://decider.com/tag/barry-jenkins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Jenkins</a> is sharing a glimpse at his latest project,&#160;The Underground Railroad. The&#160;<a href="https://decider.com/movie/moonlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonlight</a>&#160;filmmaker teased his new show on Twitter today with a preview clip titled &#8220;Preamble,&#8221; showing the cast in character for the upcoming <a href="https://decider.com/platform/prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Prime Video</a> limited series.</p>
<p>Jenkins posted his&#160;Underground Railroad&#160;first look with the caption &#8220;We the people&#8230;&#8221;. The video, which is a brief, just over one-minute peek at the series, shows rows and rows of people, with the camera slowly panning over their faces until it reaches the front row as a surging score plays in the background. &#8220;We built all this,&#8221; a man says in a voiceover, while another replies, &#8220;Who builds anything in this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>The clip stirred up plenty of excitement for in the comments, with one user <a href="https://twitter.com/jasondiamond/status/1318225495218151424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>, &#8220;Gorgeous and powerful and yet so simple and clean.&#8221; Another <a href="https://twitter.com/BubbleOfThunder/status/1318225386128302080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>, &#8220;Stunning. Striking. Can&#8217;t wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Underground Railroad,&#160;which Jenkins has been working on since 2017, is based on author Colson Whitehead&#8217;s 2016 book of the same name, which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Award for fiction. The novel, which follows two escaped slaves in Georgia, imagines an alternate Underground Railroad with a literal train system helping slaves flee their plantations.</p>
 
<p>According to the official description, the series &#8220;chronicles young Cora&#8217;s (Thuso Mbedu) journey as she makes a desperate bid for freedom in the antebellum South. After escaping her Georgia plantation for the rumored Underground Railroad, Cora discovers no mere metaphor, but an actual railroad full of engineers and conductors, and a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/09/barry-jenkins-wraps-116-day-production-1234588293/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWire</a>, Jenkins recalled his experience filming the show, explaining how much he was impacted by his time on set. &#8220;It&#8217;s the toughest thing I&#8217;ve ever done, not because it was difficult to make physically, but just emotionally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never cried on set with anything I&#8217;ve made. On this one, at least once every two weeks somebody would be like &#8216;You alright man?&#8217; I would have to walk&#8230; off the set for 10 or 15 minutes because I was just distraught. Our guidance counselor pulled me off set one day and would not let me continue to direct.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Underground Railroad&#160;finished up production last month after being forced to take a hiatus in the spring due to the coronavirus. The upcoming series stars Mbedu, Chase W. Dillon, Aaron Pierre, and <a href="https://decider.com/tag/joel-edgerton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Edgerton</a>. A release date hasn&#8217;t been announced yet, but you can check out the full teaser in Jenkins&#8217; tweet above.</p>

  'The Voice' premiere: John Legend's campaign-style ad attacking Blake Shelton backfires badly 
description: > 
  Season 19 of the NBC singing competition premiered Monday with returning coach Gwen Stefani, who hopes to give boyfriend Blake Shelton a run for his money."And just a pre-congratulations on possibly winning 'The Voice,'" said Clarkson, who admitted that she "should’ve blocked John" from Jade, but completely "forgot."Jim Ranger, 38, pastor of a small-town church in Bakersfield, California, earned chair-turns from Legend, Shelton and Stefani with his rendition of Keith Urban's "Blue Ain’t Your Color."To discourage Ranger from picking the country legend, Legend displayed his own political-style advertisement that attacked Shelton's habit of exaggerating the truth.His twisted logic appeared to work because Ranger selected Shelton as his coach.

<div><p class="teal-video-wrap"></p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Spoiler alert: This story contains details about Monday's episode of&#160;"The Voice."</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The Voice" is back.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Season 19 of the&#160;NBC singing competition premiered Monday with returning coach <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/06/16/gwen-stefani-return-the-voice-replace-nick-jonas-coach/3203427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Gwen Stefani</a>,&#160;who hopes to give boyfriend&#160;Blake Shelton a run for his money.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Blake won last season, but I&#8217;m back this season and I&#8217;m going to get a win," said Stefani, who served as a coach on&#160;Seasons 7, 9, 12 and 17.&#160;"It&#8217;s such a blessing (to be back), but things are a little bit different."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It's safe to say that things are very different. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, "The Voice" returned with a virtual audience, including contestants' families who normally joined their loved ones in-studio.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>'The Voice':</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/06/16/gwen-stefani-return-the-voice-replace-nick-jonas-coach/3203427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Gwen Stefani 'cannot wait' to return as coach, will replace Nick Jonas</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And it's clear that some of the coaches were a little rusty. Kelly Clarkson made a critical error that allowed John Legend to swoop in and pick up the first four-chair-turn of the season.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Tamara Jade wowed all the coaches with a powerful rendition of Lizzo's "Cuz I Love You."&#160;Clarkson and Legend quickly turned after Jade's opening note. Stefani and Shelton also pressed their buttons shortly after.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-television-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Clarkson threw modesty out the window&#160;("I do think it would be helpful to have someone who&#8217;s navigated a vocal competition"); Legend used flattery (You "can do literally anything"); Stefani&#160;pointed out her glittery outfit&#160;("I got dressed up for the occasion"); and Shelton went with reverse psychology ("It makes zero sense to go with someone like me").</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In the end, Jade went with Legend.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"And just a pre-congratulations on possibly winning 'The Voice,'" said Clarkson, who admitted that she "should&#8217;ve blocked John" from Jade, but completely "forgot."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">With physical touch out of the question, the coaches stepped up their game to form connections with singers to lure them&#160;to their teams. Clarkson had a closet of purple coats, Stefani used a T-shirt launcher, Shelton offered cardboard cutout replicas ("Just because I can&#8217;t hug my artists, doesn&#8217;t mean my artists can&#8217;t hug me") and Legend shook hands with a creepy extended arm.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Their pitches were equally&#160;unconventional.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jim Ranger, 38, pastor of a small-town church in Bakersfield, California,&#160;earned&#160;chair-turns from Legend, Shelton and Stefani with his rendition of Keith Urban's "Blue Ain&#8217;t Your Color."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">To discourage Ranger from picking the country legend, Legend displayed his own political-style advertisement that attacked Shelton's habit of exaggerating the truth.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"You don&#8217;t want to work with Blake. You can&#8217;t always trust this guy," Legend said.&#160;"As the son of a pastor, you want to work with someone you can really&#160;trust and believe their word. And we have an important message I want to present to Jim."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The attack ad repeatedly called Shelton a "liar." ("All he does is lie. Isn't it time you&#160;pick a coach you can believe in&#8230; I'm John Legend and I approve this message.")</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Shelton's rebuttal? "I may be full of crap, but I won&#8217;t be deterred. I do lie, but it&#8217;s only when something is important to me. It&#8217;s worth it to me to lie to these other coaches to get somebody like you on my team."</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt='Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, John Legend, Kelly Clarkson return on a COVID-conscious Season 19 of "The Voice."'><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">His twisted logic appeared to work because Ranger selected Shelton as his coach. "Luckily, my reputation precedes me," Shelton added before laughing in Legend's face.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Legend added, "It was one of a few disappointments for me today."</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/life/2018/10/26/the-voice-all-the-winners/38293017/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

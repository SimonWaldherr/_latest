  New state polls show narrowing leads for Joe Biden in key battlegrounds 
description: > 
  A new batch of polls released Tuesday showed a tightening race in several key battlegrounds â€“ including 'must-win' states for President Trump like Ohio and Florida.A University of Northern Florida / Public Opinion Research Lab poll has Biden's lead over Trump down to 1 percentage point, in a state Trump carried in 2016, with Biden leading 48 to 47 per cent.Bringing these and other voters into the sample shaves more than a percentage point off Biden's lead in the state.An Emerson automated poll has Trump leading Biden 48 to 47 per cent in Georgia.The backdrop for the battlegrounds is still a national race where polls show Biden comfortably ahead, including a Times / Siena poll with Biden leading Trump nationally by 50 to 41 per cent.

She couldn&#8217;t believe how HUGE it was and said, "I can hardly lift this,"' McEnany wrote.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Additionally, Campaign adviser Jason Miller pushed back on CNN's reporting labeling it 'fake news.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'No drama, interview was not ended abruptly and we have the receipts from the interview - all of them!' Miller tweeted. 'Maybe we need to put the whole thing out so people can see for themselves?'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Lesley&#8217;s a bad example for mask wearing, Kaitlan - don&#8217;t follow her lead!!!' Miller wrote in a tweet directed at CNN's Collins.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In early May, Stahl revealed she, like Trump, <a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/03/media/leslie-stahl-coronavirus/index.html">had been hospitalized</a> for the coronavirus.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'After two weeks at home in bed, weak, fighting pneumonia, and really scared, I went to the hospital,' she said.

I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you." He said that,' Stahl said.&#160;</p></div>

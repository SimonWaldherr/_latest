And I will -- ask them to over 180 days come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it's getting out of whack,&#8221; Biden said in an excerpt from an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-60-minutes-biden-supreme-court/" target="_blank">interview</a> with the CBS program "60 minutes," taped earlier this week in Wilmington, Delaware.</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads incontentTeads--story ad-slot"></p><p>&#8220;[I]t's not about court packing. There's a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I'd looked to see what recommendations that commission might make,&#8221; Biden added.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden speaks during a drive-in campaign rally at Riverside High School, Oct. 18, 2020 in Durham, N.C." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>When pressed on whether the commission study would center solely on the issue of packing the court, Biden pushed back, arguing there are &#8220;a number of alternatives that ... go well beyond packing.&#8221;</p><p>The answer is Biden&#8217;s clearest commitment to date of how he would address the Supreme Court as president -- while seemingly punting decisions on reforms to the system including adding seats to the bench as some progressive Democrats have advocated for, six months into his administration.</p><p>After deflecting repeated questions about whether he was for or against the idea, Biden said in a town hall with ABC News last week in Philadelphia he was &#8216;not a fan&#8217; of court packing, but committed the American people would know where he stood before Election Day.</p><p>"They do have a right to know where I'll stand and they'll have a right to know where I stand before they vote," he told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos.</p><p>In the "60 Minutes interview, Biden said discussions on how to deal with the court is very much a &#8220;live ball,&#8221; and warned he didn&#8217;t want to politicize the institution from president to president.</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads2 incontentTeads2--story ad-slot"></p><p>&#8220;The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want. Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.&#8221;</p><p>The question of Biden&#8217;s stance on the issue of court packing has lingered in the wake of the Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#8217;s death in September, when Senate Republicans said they would move forward with  the confirmation process for her successor, Judge Amy Coney Barrett -- despite having blocked President Obama&#8217;s Supreme Court nominee in March 2015 prior citing proximity to the election.</p><p>Biden has sought to keep the focus on the stakes of Coney Barrett&#8217;s confirmation to the court, particularly when it comes to health care, given her past writings on the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>&#8220;In the middle of this pandemic, why do Republicans have the time to hold a hearing on the supreme court instead of addressing the significant economic needs of local communities? I&#8217;ll tell you why, for real, not hyperbole, I'll tell you why. It&#8217;s about wiping Obamacare off the books. That&#8217;s what it is about, because their nominee has said in the past the law should be struck down,&#8221; Biden said in Durham, North Carolina, Sunday.</p></div>

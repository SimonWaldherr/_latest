It was a metaphor for a divided country.

Rather than debating each other last night — before a giant television audience spanning the political spectrum — President Trump and Joe Biden held dueling events, each on a separate network. It happened because Trump, who rejects so many of the traditions of American politics, had pulled out of a scheduled debate. Each candidate instead spoke to an audience that was probably dominated by his own supporters.

Biden’s event was fairly low-key, with him speaking in detail about his policy ideas, under questioning from ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and Pennsylvania voters. Trump’s was more combative, as he made several misleading statements and NBC’s Savannah Guthrie pressed him on them.

The key moments:

Trump said he would accept a peaceful transfer of power if he lost, but followed with false claims about voter fraud, including that “thousands of ballots” cast for him had been “dumped in a garbage can.”

Biden said elements of a decades-old crime bill he helped pass were a “mistake,” but also blamed states for how they have implemented crime policy.

Trump questioned the value of masks, suggesting scientists are divided about their worth. That’s largely false. “Masks are not perfect, but they offer significant protection,” as Apoorva Mandavilli, a Times science reporter, told me.

Biden dodged questions about whether he would try to add justices to the Supreme Court, saying he wanted to keep the focus on Republicans’ attempt to jam through a nominee. Biden added that he would clarify his position after the Senate votes on Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination.

Trump disavowed white supremacists, but refused to denounce the QAnon conspiracy theory, which claims that prominent Democrats are running child sex-trafficking rings. He instead praised its followers.

Biden pledged to reverse Trump administration policies that discriminate against transgender people.

Trump seemed to confirm a recent Times report that he has $400 million in outstanding debts.

Biden said the president deserved “a little” credit for an accord between Israel and Arab nations, but accused Trump of abandoning American allies, emboldening autocrats and having “no coherent plan for foreign policy.”

Trump shrugged off a question about his recent retweet spreading a false story about Biden’s record on military policy, saying he was simply trying to “put it out there.” Guthrie replied: “You’re the president. You’re not like someone’s crazy uncle who can retweet whatever.”

Asked what it would say about the country if he loses, Biden said: “It could say that I’m a lousy candidate, that I didn’t do a good job. But I think, I hope, that it doesn’t say that we are as racially, ethnically and religiously at odds as it appears the president wants us to be.” Biden continued to answer voters’ questions, from afar, after the event ended.

Will the events matter? Probably not. Presidential debates rarely cause major shifts in the polls, and these events were less memorable than a debate. But it’s always hard to know what matters in presidential politics.

Analysis: “My focus group applauds Biden’s humility tonight. If this race were about persona, Biden would win the vast majority of these undecided voters — but his policies scare some of them,” Frank Luntz, the conservative pollster, wrote.

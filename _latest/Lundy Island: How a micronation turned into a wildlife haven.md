I shouldn&#8217;t really be surprised. The water surrounding this small island off the north Devon coastline has long been a favourite among divers and snorkellers, and, in 2010, Lundy became the UK&#8217;s first official Marine Conservation Zone.</p><p>It&#8217;s a two-hour voyage in calm seas from Ilfracombe to Lundy, a journey that the island&#8217;s dependable supply ship has been making for decades. <i>MS Oldenburg</i> ferries fresh tourists and fresh supplies every season from March until late October. Then when the sea becomes too rough, the island helicopter takes over transport duties.</p><p class="sc-ptCms fzKffT"></p></div>

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As the coronavirus races across the country, it has reached every corner of a nursing home in Kansas, infecting all 62 residents inside. There are so few hospital beds available in North Dakota that patients sick with the virus are being ferried by ambulance to facilities 100 miles away. And in Ohio, more people are hospitalized with the virus than at any other time during the pandemic.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">After weeks of warnings that cases were again on the rise, a third surge of coronavirus infection has firmly taken hold in the United States. The nation is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">averaging 59,000 new cases a day</a>, the most since the beginning of August, and the country is on pace to record the most new daily cases of the entire pandemic in the coming days.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But if earlier surges were defined by acute and concentrated outbreaks &#8212; in the Northeast this spring, and in the South during the summer &#8212; the virus is now simmering at a worrisome level across nearly the entire country. Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming each set seven-day case records on Tuesday. Even New Jersey, once a model for bringing the virus under control, has seen <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/nyregion/nj-virus-cases.html" title="">cases double over the past month</a>.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;It is a really dangerous time,&#8221; said Dr. Tom Inglesby, an infectious-disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p></div>

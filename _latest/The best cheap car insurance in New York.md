Who gets the best car insurance rates in New York?

As you probably noticed above, people with the best credit get the lowest car insurance premiums. Generally, drivers in more rural areas will also get better rates — someone living in upstate New York will generally pay less than someone in New York City.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to calculating insurance premiums. Insurance companies will also look at factors like your age, gender, and the type of car you're insuring. Your driving history will also play a part in your insurance costs.

Every insurance company looks at these factors differently. That's why it's so important to get quotes from several different insurance companies, and compare them to make sure that you're getting the best deal.

When you're comparing, don't just look at the premium. Look for the limits that are listed with each liability, or type of coverage. The greater the coverage amount, the better the policy. Look for the one with the most coverage that fits your budget.

<div><p>There are even theories that players are celebrating less when goals are scored and there are certainly occasions when they can be seen wheeling away with an instinctive reaction only to realise that they are running towards an empty stand. At the same time it may well be that players have also altered their behaviour because they do not know if the goal will be ruled out by the VAR.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fundamental reason for doing the job they do has been taken away from them,&#8221; Bloom says and while it may be argued that players should simply get on with it and certainly those on Premier League wages - and in fairness they are - it does not alter the fact that the game they are playing at present is different from the normal and not least on an emotional level.</p>
<p>Of course it is a whole lot worse for fans starved of the opportunity of watching their team play live; of the occasion of going to the match and the camaraderie, pleasure and sense of release they gain. No player is asking for sympathy. They know how fortunate they are. But is undeniably different.</p>
<p>The stimulus is excitement but it also another powerful driver: fear. Fear can get the adrenalin pumping like nothing else can and that sense of fear has now gone. It is a myth that players block out a crowd because, in fact, for most of them it is the opposite - they feed of it.</p>
<p>What is happening this season will prove to be a fascinating study &#8211; a bit like whether home advantage has gone without supporters. It is hard to imagine, for example, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/18/tottenham-vs-west-ham-premier-league-live-score-latest-gareth/">that Tottenham Hotspur really would have surrendered a 3-0 lead against West Ham on Sunday</a> within the final 13 minutes if their stadium had been full. Similarly <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/09/26/west-brom-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">Chelsea recently came back from 3-0 against West Bromwich Albion </a>and would a fully-charged Hawthorns have allowed that to happen?</p>

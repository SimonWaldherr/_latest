Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott spoke Thursday for the first time since undergoing major surgery on a compound fracture and dislocation in his right ankle that he suffered in Week 5 against the Giants, posting an Instagram video to tell fans that he was “in great spirits.”

“What’s up everyone, just want everyone to know that I’m doing well and I can’t thank you enough for all your love, your support, your prayers over the last few days. They’ve been more than overwhelming,” Prescott said. “From teammates to family to friends to fans I don’t know to former and current players around league and players around all sports, just wanted to say thank you. They’re definitely appreciated and received well so just know that having that much love and support out there makes a huge difference.

“I’m in great spirits, headed to see the doctor, headed to see my leg for the first time post-surgery. Just ready to start this road to comeback. This little adversity is just going to be another chapter in the book. I’m excited to move forward and write it.”

Prescott completed 14 passes for 166 yards and had a receiving touchdown before he was dragged to the turf by Giants safety Logan Ryan midway through the third quarter of the Cowboys’ 37-34 win over the Giants. He immediately waved to the sideline for help after his foot appeared to snap outward.

The 27-year-old QB was then carted off the field with tears streaming down his face. He had surgery that night and will miss the rest of the 2020 season.

“Once again, I can’t thank you all enough for your love and your support through it all,” Prescott said. “But I’m in great spirits and I’m going to stay that way. Looking forward to this football season, seeing the game in a different perspective and supporting my teammates and those around the league that need it.

“Just excited for God’s purpose and God’s plan. I know it’s bigger than anything I see or that I could’ve imagined, I’m trusting Him, my faith is doubled down more than ever and I’m thankful that He’s my savior and that He guides me in life. Through Him, all this will be possible and all this will be a great comeback and a great story.”

The injury complicates Prescott’s future with the Cowboys, who drafted him 135th overall in 2016. After he was unable to reach an agreement with Dallas on a long-term extension last offseason and became just the third quarterback ever to play on a one-year franchise tag ($31.4 million salary in 2019), Prescott was in line for a huge contract thanks to another impressive season.

Prescott made 68 straight starts to begin his five-year career.

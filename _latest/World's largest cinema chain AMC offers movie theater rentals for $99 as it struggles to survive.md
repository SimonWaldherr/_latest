description: > 
  The world's largest cinema chain is offering the chance to rent an entire movie theater for just $99, as it struggles to stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic.AMC, which owns or operates approximately 1,000 theaters and 11,000 screens in 15 countries, publicized the offer on its website.Up to 20 people can attend the $99 screening for films such as Shrek, Hocus Pocus, Monsters Inc and Jurassic Park.'In compliance with these restrictions, all of our theaters worldwide have temporarily suspended operations through June,' the company said in the filing.'The number of movie theaters that will close on a permanent basis will be directly proportional to how long it takes the US to stomp out the virus.'

  Journalist Glenn Greenwald blasts the media's 'cone of silence' around Hunter Biden's email scandal 
description: > 
  Journalist Glenn Greenwald, the founder of The Intercept, has lambasted his fellow reporters and the media for 'cone of silence' regarding a report that allegedly detailed Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings.Hunter Biden’s international business deals fell into the spotlight once again last week following the new report.The e-mail appeared to identify Hunter Biden as 'Chair/Vice Chair depending on the agreement with CEFC'.The statement then diverted from the debate itself to talking points about Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's youngest son and the subject of reignited attacks from Trump's camp.If the media won’t ask Joe Biden these questions, the President will, and there will be no escape for Biden.'

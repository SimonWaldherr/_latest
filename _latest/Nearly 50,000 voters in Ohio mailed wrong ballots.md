Almost 50,000 voters in Ohio received faulty ballots in the mail due to a technical error, just weeks before the 2020 presidential election.

Local officials in Franklin County, home to the stateâ€™s capital Columbus, said the error happened after a setting was changed on a machine which sorts absentee ballots into envelopes, Politico reported. They have promised corrected ballots will be sent out within 72 hours.

Despite isolating the problem to a single issue, the snafus were varied. Some ballots had incorrect congressional races, while others were mailed to people in the wrong precinct.

Ohio is one of around a dozen potential swing states in the 2020 election between President Trump and Joe Biden, making ballot errors there particularly notable.

The news continues to fuel questions about the integrity of absentee ballots as the coronavirus pushes Americans to vote by mail in what are expected to be unprecedented numbers. Other systems in other states have also been plagued by similar problems.

In New York City alone, roughly 100,000 ballots were incorrectly mailed to voters in Brooklyn. Affected residents were sent a new ballot and asked to destroy earlier ones, though anyone who already voted was asked to vote again. In the 2020 primaries, more than 84,000 mailed-in ballots were never counted at all.

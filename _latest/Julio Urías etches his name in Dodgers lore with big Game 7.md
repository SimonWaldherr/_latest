<p>Game 5 starter <a class="link" href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maydu01.shtml" target="_blank">Dustin May</a> returned to pitch as the opener. He was replaced in the second inning by <a class="link" href="https://www.mlb.com/player/tony-gonsolin-664062" target="_blank">Tony Gonsolin</a>, who was expected to pitch the majority of the innings. But Gonsolin didn&#8217;t pitch well and forced Roberts to turn to <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2019-12-15/dodgers-blake-treinen-says-he-can-be-elite-again" target="_blank">Blake Treinen</a> to finish the fourth inning.</p><p>Treinen returned for the fifth inning. <a class="link" href="https://www.mlb.com/player/brusdar-graterol-660813" target="_blank">Brusdar Graterol</a> pitched a scoreless sixth.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>With the score tied 3-3 through six innings, Roberts called on Ur&#237;as, who pitched in relief in the NL wild-card and divisional rounds.</p><p>Ur&#237;as was breathtaking.</p><p>His fastball touching 96 mph, he recorded his first three outs on only 10 pitches.</p><p>The quick seventh inning positioned Ur&#237;as to earn the victory when <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2020-10-07/column-did-cody-bellinger-make-greatest-dodgers-catch-only-time-will-tell" target="_blank">Cody Bellinger</a> launched a 94-mph sinker by Chris Martin into the right-field stands in the bottom of the inning.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Ur&#237;as responded by navigating through the middle of the Braves&#8217; order in the eighth inning. Their best hitter, <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2020-10-12/braves-freddie-freeman-orange-el-modena-mom-cancer-dad-support" target="_blank">Freddie Freeman</a>, worked a nine-pitch at-bat, but Ur&#237;as ultimately made him line out weakly to center field.</p><p>In Roberts&#8217; mind, there was little question about who would pitch the ninth inning.</p><p><a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2020-10-17/kenley-jansen-confident-dodgers-closer-braves-nlcs-game-6" target="_blank">Kenley Jansen</a> had pitched in each of the two previous games.

<p>&#8220;I trust him,&#8221; Roberts said.</p><p>Ur&#237;as forced Ozzie Albies to ground out. He made Dansby Swanson do the same. And when his changeup was lazily golfed to center field by Austin Riley, Ur&#237;as raised his arms skyward.</p><p>Bellinger caught the fly ball, prompting <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2020-10-16/will-smiths-homer-helps-dodgers-rally-past-braves-in-game-5-of-nlcs-avoid-elimination" target="_blank">Will Smith</a> to approach the mound in celebration.

<p>&#8220;That was his moment right there,&#8221; Seager said. &#8220;That was his game to win, and he went out and did it.&#8221;</p><p>The journey to postseason glory was an unconventional one for Ur&#237;as.</p><p>The Dodgers signed him as a 16-year-old on the same 2012 trip to Mexico in which they landed <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-yasiel-puig-dodgers-legacy-reds-20190414-story.html" target="_blank">Yasiel Puig</a>. They deal happened by chance. The Dodgers were in town to see another prospect, a catcher named Julian Leon.</p><p>Ur&#237;as was still 16 when he pitched in the Class-A Midwest League. His precocity presented a problem for the Dodgers, who had to balance his short- and long-term interests, as well as their own.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

    </p>
<p></p><p>Even after he broke into the majors as a 19-year-old, they continued to manage his workload carefully. He was shuttled back and forth between the majors and minors. He started at times and pitched in relief in others.</p><p>His development was set back further by a shoulder injury in 2017 that required surgery. He spent most of 2018 in recovery.</p><p>&#8220;Julio is very talented,&#8221; Roberts said. &#8220;He&#8217;s very smart, and he&#8217;s very tough. We&#8217;ve kind of handled him over the last four years with kid gloves, kind of trying to build him up and put him in different roles, some that he hasn&#8217;t really liked and appreciated,, which I totally get. But when it comes down to it, he just wants to pitch, wants to compete and wants to help the Dodgers win.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Including a pair of wins he picked up as a reliever in the previous two rounds, he&#8217;s 4-0 this postseason.</p><p>He&#8217;s a veteran of 16 postseason games with a career playoff earned-run average of 2.84. He has six career postseason victories, which is more than any pitcher has ever recorded before his 25th birthday.</p><p>And he now has his signature moment, three innings that will forever change how he is viewed. Sunday night, for the first time in his career, what he did was more important than whom he could become.</p><p><i>Hern&#225;ndez reported from Los Angeles.</i></p></div>

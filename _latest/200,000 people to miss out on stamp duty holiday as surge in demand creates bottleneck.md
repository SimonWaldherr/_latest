Up to 200,000 people risk missing out on stamp duty savings because of backlogs in the property market, a campaign group of large property companies has warned.

Even people who agree to a sale by next week have just a 50-50 chance of getting the transaction through before the stamp duty holiday ends on March 31, separate research suggests. Experts said that buyers could pull out of transactions if they will not get the tax saving, which could cause chains to collapse and push prices down.

Pent-up demand as people held off moving house – first over Brexit and then during lockdown – sparked an explosion of activity this summer. The announcement of a temporary stamp duty cut in July added fuel to the fire.

However, lenders, surveyors and conveyancers – many of which are running at reduced capacity – are struggling to cope. Bottlenecks mean up to 200,000 people could miss out on savings of up to £15,000, the property firms, which asked not to be named, said.

Separate figures from TwentyCi, a property consultancy, suggest it takes three months on average from agreeing a sale to completing the transaction. But around 150,000 sales are currently being agreed each month, or 50pc more than usual, it said. Taking into account current delays, its calculations suggested the time between agreeing a sale and completion would increase from three months to just over five.

The firm’s Stuart Ducker said: “Allowing for a Christmas break, this suggests that half of sales agreed from Oct 22 will not go through by the end of March. In other words, we are less than a week away from the tipping point.”

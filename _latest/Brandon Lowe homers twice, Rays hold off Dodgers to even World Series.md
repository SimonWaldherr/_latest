		<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) &#8212; <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/21600/brandon-lowe" target="_blank">Brandon Lowe</a> busted out early and Tampa Bay&#8217;s bullpen hung on late.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Rays and Dodgers, tied after two in Texas.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Lowe shook loose from his extended postseason slump with two opposite-field homers, and Tampa Bay held off Los Angeles 6-4 on Wednesday night to square the World Series at one game apiece.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162"><a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20623/blake-snell" target="_blank">Blake Snell</a> struck out nine in 4 2/3 innings for the Rays and didn&#8217;t allow a hit until <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20248/chris-taylor" target="_blank">Chris Taylor</a>&#8217;s two-run homer trimmed it to 5-2 in the fifth. Los Angeles threatened to complete a big comeback in the eighth, but Tampa Bay&#8217;s relievers held firm.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Lowe and <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20856/joey-wendle" target="_blank">Joey Wendle</a> each drove in three runs for the Rays.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162"><a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/21588/nick-anderson" target="_blank">Nick Anderson</a> got four outs for the win. <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/21512/diego-castillo" target="_blank">Diego Castillo</a> earned the save when he struck out Taylor, the only batter he faced.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162"><a class="" href="https://www.mlb.com/video/brandon-lowe-s-solo-home-run-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe hit an opposite-field solo homer to left-center</a>&#160;in the first off <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/15127/tony-gonsolin" target="_blank">Tony Gonsolin</a>, putting the American League champion Rays ahead for the first time at this neutral-site World Series with their 27th home run of the postseason, matching a major league record. The second baseman was hitting .107 this postseason, and in an even worse 4-for-48 slide (.083) the past 13 games since the start of the AL Division Series.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">By the time he went deep again in the fifth, his second opposite-field shot of the game and the entire season &#8212; with a runner on against <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/21373/dustin-may" target="_blank">Dustin May</a>, already the fourth Dodgers pitcher &#8212; it was 5-0.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Will Smith and NLCS MVP <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20061/corey-seager" target="_blank">Corey Seager</a> also homered for the Dodgers. Seager&#8217;s solo shot in the eighth was his seventh homer and 16th RBI, extended the franchise records he had already set this postseason. Those are also the most homers by a shortstop in any MLB postseason.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">After an off day, Game 3 is Friday night when there will be a pair of big-game starters on extra rest after both pitched last Saturday.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Right-hander <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20985/walker-buehler" target="_blank">Walker Buehler</a> threw six scoreless innings for the Dodgers in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series. <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/18753/charlie-morton" target="_blank">Charlie Morton</a>, who has won all three of his starts this postseason and was the Game 7 winner for Houston at Dodger Stadium in the World Series three years ago, went 5 2/3 scoreless innings in the Rays&#8217; Game 7 ALCS-clinching win over the Astros.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Snell already had all his strikeouts when he walked Kik&#233; Hern&#225;ndez with two outs in the fifth before Taylor, the No. 9 batter, homered on his 80th pitch. The Rays ace was out of the game two batters later, after <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20029/mookie-betts" target="_blank">Mookie Betts</a> walked and Seager singled. Anderson got out of the jam with a strikeout of <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/19069/justin-turner" target="_blank">Justin Turner</a>.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">The Dodgers knew it would be primarily a bullpen game using various arms, instead of bringing back Buehler on short rest after ace lefty <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/18665/clayton-kershaw" target="_blank">Clayton Kershaw</a> threw six strong innings in their 8-3 win Tuesday night in Game 1.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Four of the first five LA pitchers allowed runs, with <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20813/dylan-floro" target="_blank">Dylan Floro</a> keeping a clean slate after benefiting from a nice defensive play and a replay review that ended the second. The Dodgers were the first team to use four pitchers within the first four innings of a World Series game since the Oakland Athletics against Cincinnati in Game 3 of the 1990 World Series.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Gonsolin, the rookie right-hander who started, allowed Lowe&#8217;s first homer and was done after 1 1/3 innings. That was the shortest start in a World Series game since San Francisco&#8217;s Jake Peavy was done after giving up five runs in 1 1-/ innings in a 10-0 loss at Kansas City in Game 6 of the 2014 World Series.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Snell threw only 10 pitches in a 1-2-3 first that included strikeouts of Betts and Turner. After 11 of his first 15 pitches in the second inning were balls, among two walks and a strikeout, the 2018 Al Cy Young Award winner retired the next 10 batters until the walk to Hern&#225;ndez in the fifth.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">The left-hander was attacking with breaking pitches in the strike zone, not his usual pattern, since the Dodgers don&#8217;t often chase. But Los Angeles didn&#8217;t get many bats on the ball against him. But less than a week after an aggressive hook by manager Kevin Cash to take Snell out of Game 6 of the ALCS after four innings, he still hasn&#8217;t completed six innings in a game since July 2019.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Smith homered for Los Angeles in the sixth off Anderson.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">A bobble by Hern&#225;ndez at second base proved costly, taking away a potential inning-ending double play in the fourth before the Dodgers changed pitchers again and gave up two runs.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">With one out and <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/21579/randy-arozarena" target="_blank">Randy Arozarena</a> at first, <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20099/ji-man-choi" target="_blank">Ji-Man Choi</a> hit a grounder to Hern&#225;ndez, and by time the second baseman gathered the ball to get the force, Seager&#8217;s relay throw was late. <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/baseball/mlb/player/20334/manuel-margot" target="_blank">Manuel Margot</a> then greeted May, the third reliever, with a single before Wendle&#8217;s two-run double into the right-center gap for a 3-0 lead.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Wendle added a sacrifice fly in the sixth.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">UP NEXT</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Rays: Morton faces the first time since the 2017 World Series, when he pitched the final four innings for the Astros in Game 7. Morton also pitched in Game 4 that Series, when he limited LA to one run and three hits while striking out seven over 6 1/3 innings &#8212; a game the Dodgers won 6-2 after a five-run ninth.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-171 Component-p-0-2-162">Dodgers: Buehler&#8217;s only previous World Series start was Game 3 against Boston in 2018, when he threw seven scoreless innings in the only game the Dodgers won against Betts and the Red Sox in that Series.</p>

Buy-and-hold investing, where minimal changes are made to a portfolio, is not obviously suited to the Telegraph’s Fantasy Fund Manager game.

With free and unlimited trading, on top of constant pressure to catch up with your competitors over a short three-month game period, it takes a stubborn investor to leave their portfolio unchanged from day one.

Matt Górecki, a 29-year-old business consultant, did just that and took home the weekly £100 prize last week after his portfolio, “iwanttobuyatesla”, jumped 11pc from £103,000 to £114,500.

“The best thing to do is make a call and stick to it until it turns out right,” he said. His fund contained oil giants Shell and BP, as well as Oxford Biomedica, which is involved in finding a Covid-19 vaccine, and Spirent Communications, a telecoms company.

“Oxford Biomedica has done well from coronavirus and its run continued after a 6pc jump last week,” he said. Spirent Communications was another big contributor to his fund’s excellent performance. Its shares rose 11pc after positive reports from stock analysts. This week, it said it grew sales 7pc in the first half of 2020.

Mr Górecki bought the oil majors because he thought the oil price collapse was an over-reaction and it would return to its longer-term average in time.

Mr Górecki is a keen amateur investor. “I have a degree in real estate investing and now work in market research,” he said. “This means that I am always reading the news and making conclusions about what will do well and what won’t.”

In his real portfolio, his largest holdings are American tech firms. His favourites include semiconductor makers Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.

The Telegraph Fantasy Fund Manager game will run from July 6 to October 2 2020. The winner will receive £20,000 and there will be weekly prizes of £100, courtesy of our sponsor AJ Bell Youinvest.

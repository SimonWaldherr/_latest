The PGA Tour is in a stretch of its season that is normally a little less high profile. This year the fall brings the Masters due to Covid-19, but traditionally, things kick it up in the later winter, early spring months. However, this weekend we get a star-studded tournament in Las Vegas.

The annual CJ Cup is moving to the desert for the first time in its four-year history. The first three years of the event took place in South Korea, but this year it is moving to Shadow Creek Golf Course. Justin Thomas won a year ago with a -20, finishing two shots ahead of Danny Lee and five shots ahead of Hideki Matsuyama, Cameron Smith, and Gary Woodland.

The 78-player field is a bit cozier and features any of the top 60 golfers available from the previous yearâ€™s FedEx Cup points leaderboard. This year, we get a field that includes Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Rory McIlroy, and Xander Schauffele, among a host of others.

DraftKings Sportsbook has posted odds to win, and Johnson is the favorite at +850. The top five includes him, Rahm (+1000), Thomas (+1200), McIlroy (+1400), and Schauffele (+1400). The longest odds for the tournament belong to Seonghyun Kim at +75000.

Here are complete odds for the 2020 CJ Cup.

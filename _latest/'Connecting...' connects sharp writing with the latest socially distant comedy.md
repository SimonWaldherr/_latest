(CNN) "Connecting..." is just one of several post-coronavirus shows shot employing a Zoom-style, virtual format, focusing on a group of friends -- diverse even by TV-sitcom standards -- navigating the early days of quarantine measures. Yet it turns out to be smartly written, funny and occasionally touching, capturing the need for connection amid the struggles unique to this period.

Each week begins with the date, opening on "March 29, 2020" and jumping to April 15 and May 25 in the subsequent episodes previewed.

At the core of it all is a classic Sam-and-Diane relationship, with the prospect of romance between two of the longtime pals -- something about which the others, naturally, strategize and gossip -- at the worst possible time.

Ben (Preacher Lawson) has just broken up with a girlfriend none of them liked, seemingly leaving the door open for Annie (Otmara Marrero), who has long harbored feelings for him, in a scenario where the two were never previously free and single at the same time. Still, the proposed act of suggesting that they move in together -- given his stated loneliness -- feels like a major leap that she's understandably reluctant to make.

They're surrounded by friends each dealing with the crisis in their own way, as they discuss everything from the silly ("The NBA is not coming back this year!") to the sobering, which includes hearing from a nurse seeing the virus' impact firsthand as well as the Black Lives Matter movement.

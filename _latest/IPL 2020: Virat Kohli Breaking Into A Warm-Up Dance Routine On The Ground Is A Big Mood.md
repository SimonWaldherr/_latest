It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Virat Kohli is as big a brand as Cricket itself right now. The Indian skipper who has his hands busy with IPL 2020 is almost all one can talk about on the days when he is playing with his Royal Challengers Bangalore team. While things do tend to go either way (all the way to the stands where actress and wife Anushka Sharma is often seen cheering for her husband), it is mostly because of his prowess on the ground both as a cricketer and captain. Hey, wining/losing is part of the parcel but his zeal and the hilarious ways in which Kohli hypes his boys is commendable.

No wonder, he broke out into a full dance sesh during a practices session before they set out against Kings XI Punjab. Yes, Virat Kohli was seen doing an impromptu warm-up dance before the match and it’s a big mood.

Not just me; even Twitter agrees! Needless to say, the Twitterverse can’t stop but relate to the moment and the result is here – golden memes. From funny reactions to mash-ups with Madhuri Dixit’s classic hum yeh kisne hara rang daala, it’s a goldmine of memes out there. See for yourself.

Dance pe chance maarle ❤️😍

Now, they might have not won the match but it was a special one nevertheless as it marked Virat Kohli’s 200th appearance for the franchise. He was even quoted saying, “RCB means a lot, not many understand that emotion. 200 games for them is unbelievable, I wouldn't have believed it in 2008. It is an honour, they've kept me and I have stayed on,” and that alone should count. Also, I don’t know about you but this is going to be my vibe for the rest of the year. Thanks cap, I owe you one.

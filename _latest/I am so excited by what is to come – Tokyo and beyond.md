<div><p>This year, more than any, returning to training after my-off season break holds an anticipation for me that I have not felt before. I am so excited to get back on to the track and ready for the next season, and the next cycle.</p>
<p>After what can only be described as a year of unprecedented upheaval and change, we finally go into training for the Olympic season &#8211; again. There is a definite sense of deja vu for me. This time last year we had just finished the World Championships in Qatar, and all planning, thoughts and actions were focused on doing well in Tokyo. I remember winter training being so tough, then &#8211; just when we were starting to move into the next phase of my programme and thinking about getting ready to race again &#8211; the pandemic struck, and the Games had to be postponed. Frankly, it has been a strange time for us all.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances I am known for going completely MIA from track and field at this time of year. Typically, athletes will be absolutely exhausted by the time the autumn off-season arrives.</p>
<p>We would have been training up to six days a week for the past 11 months, competing across the world throughout the season; we would have lived through the crowning moment of the year &#8211; with tears of joy or frustration &#8211; the major championships to which we would have given everything, and then &#8211; almost spent &#8211; we would have picked ourselves back up for the final races of the season, typically Diamond League events.</p>
<p>By the time October comes around, most athletes are exhausted. It is the point in the year when all work goes on hold, and my friends and I rush to hop on the first flight to a destination with sun, sand and good food. I often end up sleeping my way through my break, recovering physically and psychologically before it is time to push again.</p>
<p>But of course 2020 has been a year like no other. Having no major championships to prepare for, our goals have all shifted. For some, and I include myself, there was no need for that big physical unload that off season is designed for. I have been training hard and consistently but, of course, did not have a typical season.</p>
<p>While my body did not feel tired, my mind certainly did. Just as this year has been challenging for so many people, I needed that psychological break and change in focus. Ordinarily I spend my year travelling across time zones, running on tracks around the world. This year, like the rest of the population, I have mainly been at home.</p>

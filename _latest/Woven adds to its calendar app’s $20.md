<div><p id="speakable-summary">Productivity software has had a huge couple of years, yet for all of the great note-taking apps that have launched, consumers haven&#8217;t gotten a lot of quality options for Google Calendar replacements.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://woven.com/">Woven</a>, a calendar startup founded by former Facebook CIO Tim Campos is shaking up the premium tier of their scheduling software, hoping that productivity-focused users will pay to further optimize the calendar experience just as they have paid up for subscription email services like Superhuman and note-taking apps like Notion.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a pretty huge influx of investor dollars into the productivity space which has shown a lot of promise in bottoms-up scaling inside enterprises by first aiming to sell their products to individuals. Woven has raised about $5 million to date with investments from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/battery-ventures" target="_blank">Battery Ventures, </a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/felicis-ventures" target="_blank">Felicis Ventures </a> and Tiny Capital, among others.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>&#8220;Time is the most valuable asset that we have,&#8221; Campos told TechCrunch. &#8220;We think there&#8217;s a real opportunity to do much more with the calendar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their new product will help determine just how much demand there is for a pro-tier calendar that aims to make life easier for professionals than Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar cares to. The new product, which is $20 per month ($10 during an early access period if you pay for a year), builds on the company&#8217;s free tier product giving users a handful of new features. There&#8217;s still quite a bit of functionality in the free tier still, which is sticking around, but the lack of multi-account support is one of the big limitations there.&#160;</p>

In this latest update, the startup has also launched a new feature called Open Invite which allows users to blast out links to join webinars that recipients can quickly register for.</p>
<p>One of Woven&#8217;s top features is probably Smart Templates which aims to learn from your habits and strip down the amount of time it takes to organize a meeting. Selecting the template can automatically set you up with a one-time <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-video-communications" target="_blank">Zoom </a> link, ping participants for their availability with Woven&#8217;s&#160;scheduling links and take care of mundane details. Now, the titles automatically update depending on participants, location or company information as well. While plenty of productivity happens on the desktop, the startup is trying to push the envelope on mobile as well. They&#8217;ve added an iMessage integration to quickly allow people to share their availability and schedule meetings inside chat.</p>
<p>The product updates arrive soon after the announcement of the company&#8217;s Zoom &#8220;Zapp,&#8221; which shoves the app&#8217;s functionality inside Zoom and will likely be a bit sell to new users.</p>

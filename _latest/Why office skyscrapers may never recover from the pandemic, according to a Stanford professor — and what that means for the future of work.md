<p>As pandemic-related work-from-home measures wrap up their seventh month in the US, most previously bustling downtowns remain emptied. With a coronavirus vaccine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-what-to-watch-leading-research-2020-3">still under development</a>, companies are adjusting for the long haul: Microsoft is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-employess-to-work-from-home-permanently-2020-10">workshopping a hybrid model</a> that schedules how many employees can come to the office on a given day, while <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-remote-work-permanent-adapting-relocation-collaboration-melanie-collins-2020-10">Dropbox</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-half-of-all-employees-remote-2030-2020-5">is permanently embracing remote work</a> by getting rid of traditional offices altogether. Even once it is safe for people to start going back to offices en masse, old norms may be less popular.&#160;</p><p>"COVID is the skyscraper killer," said professor of economics at Stanford, Nick Bloom, during a panel on the future of work at <a href="https://trendsfestival.com/">Business Insider's Global Trends Festival.</a></p><p>Bloom, along with CEO of AVIV Group Ralf Baumann, and WeWork managing director Nikolay Kolev, discussed how a city's role as a work hub could change drastically as companies adopt new, less dense workplaces.&#160;</p><p>Bloom pointed to the Salesforce Tower, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-tower-office-tour-photos-2018-5">the tallest building in downtown San Francisco</a>. The 61-floor skyscraper, impossible to miss in San Francisco's downtown corridor, may be unappealing to the post-pandemic office employee who doesn't want to sit in mass transit and use a small elevator to reach their office.&#160;</p><p>"Skyscrapers feel like cursed buildings right now," Bloom said "No one wants to work in skyscrapers."</p><p>While mega-offices may not recover, according to Bloom, that doesn't meant that offices overall are dead. In his own research, he found that 24% of 2,500 working-age adults polled in May wanted to continue working from home five days a week once the pandemic passed, while 39.5% said they wanted to work from home "never" or "rarely".&#160;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-remote-work-tools-productivity-zoom-slack-google-meet-gitlab-2020-10" title="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-remote-work-tools-productivity-zoom-slack-google-meet-gitlab-2020-10">While Zoom calls and messaging apps</a> have helped companies through the pandemic, they're not a permanent solution for everyone, according to WeWork's Kolev.&#160;</p><p>"The fact that we managed through the pandemic was crisis management," he said. "And it was great, and work-from-home was definitely the solution for that. But coming out of the pandemic we need to find the right balance because people do not want to stay only at home."</p>

<p>WeWork has a front-row seat to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-latest-wework-news-2019-6">this shifting dynamic</a>, as it has seen both widespread vacancies (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-office-vacancies-dock-72-other-locations-new-york-city-2020-7?r=wework-lp">20% of space in it's largest market, New York City, was empty in July)</a>, while also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6b977ff2-ca5c-449a-bb6b-46039bd26c9b">demand from companies that want flexible offices.</a></p><p>A hybrid working environment might be a good thing, said AVIV's Baumann. Though many employees prefer working from home, they miss out on informal information and communication by not working closely with each other.</p><p>"What you pick up when you're in the office or in the coffee shop, that is something we are missing," Baumann said.&#160;</p><p>Companies will have to rethink what office spaces that can both foster collaboration and offer flexibility and adequate space.&#160;</p><p>"How do we design a place where we give the kind of space where community can live up?" Kolev said. "And at the same time, provide a space where people can work in their own office, can work in a small team?"</p><p>That kind of collaboration is key in the long term, according to Baumann, as brainstorming and experimentation that was once done in person is harder to replicate online.&#160;</p><p>"The other part what concerns me really is this creativity part," Baumann said.&#160;</p><p>Bloom said office parks that have parking lots and can be reasonably stair-accessible might become the new normal. It's a far cry from the flashy silver towers clustered in once high-traffic areas, but, low-density spaces will be a priority, he said.&#160;</p>

<p>There are signs that this kind of office development continues. Amazon, for instance is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-adds-jobs-new-office-hub-locations-2020-8">building out six "tech hubs" scattered throughout the US</a> while <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-kirkland-office-urban-seattle-sundar-pichai-2020-8">Google is expanding its offices in the Seattle area.&#160;</a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-kirkland-office-urban-seattle-sundar-pichai-2020-8"></a></p>

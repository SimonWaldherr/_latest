In real estate, sometimes you have to stop and smell the rosé. A new condo building called Hillrose28, developed by Forkosh Development with sales by Corcoran Sunshine, just launched sales of its 43 units from $1.35 million.

The building’s name comes from its location.

At 181 E. 28th St. near Third Avenue, it’s in a micro-neighborhood the developer has dubbed “Rose Hill,” which abuts Kips Bay, NoMad, Murray Hill and Gramercy Park.

Inspired by the name of the neighborhood — whose borders are roughly 23rd Street to the south, 32nd Street to the north, Madison Avenue to the west and Third Avenue to the east — the building’s management team has developed its own wine, Hillrosé28, which is exclusively available in the on-site sales gallery.

Slated to be complete in spring 2021, the 20-story tower is clad in limestone, with apartments that range from studios to four-bedrooms.

Many with private outdoor space, an especially alluring amenity during the coronavirus pandemic.

The largest penthouse will hit the market for $9.95 million.

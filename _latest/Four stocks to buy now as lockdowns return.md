<div><p>The second wave of lockdowns being implemented across Britain is likely once again to separate the stock market&#8217;s coronavirus winners from the losers.</p>
<p>When the first lockdown was imposed, stocks fell in unison, before winners began to appear. Online businesses stood out, from retail to gambling to takeaways. Will the same companies thrive this time or will there be a new wave of winners?</p>
<h3>Asos</h3>
<p>As Christmas approaches, the shift to online shopping is sure to accelerate, and the sector&#8217;s existing leaders will benefit. One is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/questor-rejuvenated-asos-has-better-algorithm-amazon/">Asos</a>, the online clothing company, whose shares have risen fourfold since March lows.</p>
<p>In financial results last week, it announced 19pc sales growth for the year to Aug 31 and profits before tax of &#163;140m, four times higher than last year. Joe Healey of The Share Centre, a stockbroker, said Asos continued to defy the gloomy retail environment, highlighting the strength of its online-only business model through the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been sheltered from the retail tornado that Covid created, involving store closures and reduced footfall,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the pandemic, Asos has focused on the areas of the business it can make more efficient. This has grown profitability and built a foundation on which it can build and improve margins, which will be key for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Analysts at Bank of America were less optimistic. They said the firm had failed to meet expectations and rivals were growing more quickly. Its reliance on the &#8220;20-somethings&#8221;, who will bear the brunt of lockdown-related job cuts is also a challenge.</p>

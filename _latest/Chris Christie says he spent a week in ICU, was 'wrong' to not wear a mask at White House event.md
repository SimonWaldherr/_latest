Former Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday he was "wrong" not to wear a mask in the days before testing positive for COVID-19, but that he felt at that time that he was in a "safe zone" because of frequent testing.

Having spent a week being treated for the disease caused by the coronavirus – in an intensive care unit – Christie said he had a chance for greater reflection about his actions and the virus.

"It is something to take very seriously. The ramifications are wildly random and potentially deadly," Christie said in a statement, first reported by the New York Times. "No one should be happy to get the virus and no one should be cavalier about being infected or infecting others."

Christie's position and his message to the public is at odds with President Donald Trump, whom he helped prepare for a debate and was also hospitalized with COVID-19. Trump has said he feels great, has entertained large, mask-less crowds at campaign rallies and urged the public, "don't be afraid of COVID."

In contrast, Christie said, "I hope that my experience shows my fellow citizens that you should follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others."

STILE:For Chris Christie, entry to Trump World comes with a steep price — COVID-19

Christie, 58, checked in to Morristown Medical Center on Oct. 2, a day after testing positive. He said at the time he felt fine and was seeking medical care as a precaution.

But he was given "extraordinary treatments," including the anti-viral Remdesivir and a cocktail by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, he said. He concluded those factors "contributed to my good health today."

Besides helping Trump prepare for his debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden, Christie also attended the Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony to announce Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court.That event is considered a "superspreader event." Christie said he didn't wear a mask at those times.

"I was wrong," Christie said.

Still, Christie said dominant political and media extremes have governed the reaction to the virus. There are those who do not take the virus seriously, but on the other end "alarmists" who would continue lockdown measures and not trust people's common sense. He said it is not an "either/or" proposition.

"As a former public official, I believe we have not treated Americans as adults, who understand truth, sacrifice and responsibility that I know them to be," Christie said.

He said public officials should advocate wearing masks, social distancing and frequent hand washing. But locations that have taken the brunt of the shutdowns should reopen to get back to a life where people can support their families using common sense.

"Even during a contentious election year, we must trust the American people with the truth," Christie said. "I believe that these two steps can bring our country together while our pharmaceutical companies invent the therapeutics and vaccines which will rid us of this virus."

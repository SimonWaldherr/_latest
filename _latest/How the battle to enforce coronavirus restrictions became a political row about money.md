It was the day when Boris Johnson's claim to be led by the science in his response to the coronavirus crisis unravelled live on television as his national strategy ended up becoming an unseemly political row about money.

A plan to pressure Greater Manchester to accept harsher Covid restrictions by first announcing tougher measures for London backfired when the Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham, held a teatime press conference to accuse ministers of "treating the North with contempt".

Speaking on the steps of Manchester Town Hall, Mr Burnham said he was adamantly against the city moving into the "very high" tier of restrictions, in which pubs and bars must close and household mixing is banned.

"They are willing to sacrifice jobs here to save them elsewhere," he said. "We will not be treated as canaries in a coalmine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy."

Mr Burnham demanded more money to support people whose jobs were under threat in a tougher lockdown, calling for a "full and fair 80 per cent furlough scheme for all affected workers, 80 per cent income support for people who are self-employed and a proper compensation scheme for businesses".

  New organ found in human throat that lubricates area behind nose 
description: > 
  Scientists in the Netherlands have discovered a new organ in the human throat.Dubbing them the 'tubarial salivary glands,' the team believes the organ helps keep an area behind the nose well-lubricated.Avoiding these glands in patients receiving radiation treatment 'may provide an opportunity to improve their quality of life,' according to the report, published last month in Radiotherapy and Oncology.'People have three sets of large salivary glands, but not there,' Vogel said.Vogel says radiation would cause the same side effects in the tubarial salivary glands.

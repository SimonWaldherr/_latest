<div><p>Democrat says court system is &#8216;getting out of whack&#8217; and says commission would have 180 days to make recommendations</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden" class="u-underline">Joe Biden</a> has confirmed he would appoint a special commission to study the US court system over 180 days, if he is elected next month, to provide reform recommendations relating to the supreme court and beyond.</p>
<p>In response to questions about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court" class="u-underline">US supreme court</a> during an interview for this Sunday&#8217;s 60 Minutes news magazine, the former vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee told CBS TV managing editor Norah O&#8217;Donnell that the court system is &#8220;getting out of whack&#8221; and that &#8220;there&#8217;s a number of alternatives that go well beyond &#8216;packing&#8217;&#8221;, ie increasing the number of seats on the nine-justice supreme court bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last thing we need to do is turn the supreme court into just a political football, [that means] whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want,&#8221; Biden said in the interview, which airs just nine days ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Presidents come and go. Supreme court justices stay for generations,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>In keeping with the show&#8217;s election tradition, both candidates will be featured in separate interviews to spell out their plans for the country. The previews come following reports that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" class="u-underline">Donald Trump</a> abruptly ended what was intended to be an hour-long interview at the White House after 45 minutes, before chastising correspondent Stahl for her professionalism and lack of mask.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US president has been talking about doing his own pre-emptive defense.</p>

<p>Biden vowed that if he prevails in November&#8217;s election he will &#8220;put together a bipartisan commission of constitutional scholars &#8211; Democrats, Republicans, liberal, conservative&#8221; over &#8220;180 days come back to me with recommendations&#8221; on the US court system.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way in which it&#8217;s being handled and it&#8217;s not about court packing,&#8221; Biden argued, adding &#8220;there&#8217;s a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I&#8217;ve looked to see what recommendations that commission might make.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Democrat kept the focus on the recovery from a pandemic and recession, Trump, meanwhile, vaguely looked forward to one goal: &#8220;To get back to normal&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back to where we were, to have the economy rage and be great with jobs and everybody be happy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going, and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re heading.&#8221;</p>

<p>The president then took aim at China, calling them &#8220;an adversary,&#8221; &#8220;a competitor&#8221; and a &#8220;foe&#8221; before slamming the country for giving rise to the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>

The main event of Bellator 248 saw Michael Page go the distance for only the fourth time in his professional career. But the English welterweight did enough to take the victory on the scorecards, as he claimed a unanimous decision win over the debuting Ross Houston in Paris.

Former Cage Warriors welterweight champion Houston (8-1 MMA, 0-1 BMMA) came out looking calm, composed, and patient in the early moments of the 175-pound catchweight matchup, and appeared to make a major breakthrough when he caught a jumping knee attempt from Page (18-1 MMA, 14-1 BMMA) and took “MVP” to the mat.

However, Houston’s pursuit of an improved position on the mat meant he didn’t unload any serious ground and pound from top position as an opportunity to connect with some significant offense came and went with the sound of the bell at the end of the round,

Page came out at the start of Round 2 with his hands uncharacteristically high, and stung Houston with a rapier-like right hand. He then backed Houston against the cage and snapped the Scot’s head backward with an uppercut that Houston dismissed with a wagging finger.

Page then shrugged off Houston’s takedown attempt to send his foe to the mat, then landed some stinging ground strikes, including a big shot that connected with the back of Houston’s head that forced referee Todd Anderson to halt the action to allow Houston to recover.

When the action resumed, Houston moved in and looked to take Page to the canvas, but the Englishman turned the tables and took Houston down instead. “MVP” then moved into side control for the remaining seconds of the round.

This meant the action headed into a third and final round and, with Houston unable to find an opening and Page scoring with pot-shots from the outside, action was in short supply as the bout went all the way to the judges’ scorecards.

All three scored the fight for the Englishman, as Page polled scores of 29-28, 30-27, 30-27 to extend his win streak to four and hand Houston the first defeat of his professional career.

By unanimous decision, MVP wins it! He moves to 18-1 in @BellatorMMA. pic.twitter.com/a7yyutwTl8 — CBS Sports Network (@CBSSportsNet) October 10, 2020

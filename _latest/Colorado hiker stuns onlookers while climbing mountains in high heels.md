<div><p>An avid Colorado hiker looking for a new challenge traded in her trail shoes for high heels to climb some of the state&#8217;s highest peaks.</p>
<p>Erin Ton, 22, switched to the unconventional hiking footwear last month after climbing 57 of the state&#8217;s &#8220;fourteeners&#8221; &#8212; Colorado mountains over 14,000 feet &#8212; since August 2018, <a href="https://gazette.com/life/colorado-woman-turns-heads-while-hiking-14ers-in-high-heels/article_3994cdd4-0a5c-11eb-bcfb-732a8be77a8f.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Colorado Springs Gazette reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it would be a fun celebration to hike Elbert again, but do it in high heels,&#8221; Ton told the paper, referring to Mount Elbert, the first of the fourteeners she hiked years before. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of a full-circle thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then, Ton, a Cornell University graduate, reached three other peaks in heels, the report said.</p>
<p>Ton said her high-heel climbs attract a lot of attention from other hikers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t help that I&#8217;m blond, I&#8217;m female, and I&#8217;ve been told that I look like I&#8217;m 17 or 18,&#8221; she told the paper.</p>
<p>Ton said she limits the heel-wearing for the ascent and carries medical supplies for blisters or irritation. On the way down, she uses her trail shoes.</p>
<p>For those wondering why, Ton said, &#8220;It&#8217;s more like, why not?&#8221;</p>

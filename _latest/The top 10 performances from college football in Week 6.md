Week 6 of college football was not kind to defenses across the board. Running backs and wideouts reigned supreme and left countless defenders heartbroken on the way to end zones across the country in high-scoring shootouts.

Quarterbacks enjoyed comfortable pockets and propelled their teams to wins with both their arms and their legs. And of course, some of these players played the hero role as their underdog teams came out on top against some touted opponents.

Ranking the top 10 performances from Week 6:

1. Terrace Marshall Jr., LSU, WR: Marshall was electric in LSU's 45-41 loss to Missouri. He racked up 11 receptions for 235 yards and three touchdowns in the losing effort, including a 75-yard deep ball through the heart of the Tigers secondary.

2. Michael Carter, North Carolina, RB: The Tar Heels called their tailback's number throughout their 56-45 win against Virginia Tech and the senior answered every time. Carter had 214 yards on 17 carries and two touchdowns in the high-scoring affair.

3. Sam Ehlinger, Texas QB: The Texas signal caller led the Longhorns through the air and on the ground in a four-overtime thriller against Big 12 rival Oklahoma. Ehlinger threw for 287 yards, rushed for 112 and had a total of six touchdowns in the latest iteration of the Red River Showdown. His efforts were in vain, however. The Sooners won 53-45.

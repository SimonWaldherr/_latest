Chelsea stars Timo Werner and Kai Havertz both scored as Germany had to twice come from behind to earn a rollercoaster 3-3 draw against visitors Switzerland in an exciting Nations League group game packed with incident on Tuesday.

The result moves Germany within a point of League A Group Four leaders Spain, who lost 1-0 away to Ukraine, while the Swiss, who are still without a win, remain bottom.

The visitors stunned Germany with Mario Gavranovic's fifth minute header and doubled the lead in the 26th when they intercepted a pass from Toni Kroos, in his 100th international, and Remo Freuler beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with a cool chip.

Werner hit back for the hosts two minutes later, wrongfooting keeper Yann Sommer with a clever low shot, as the Germans maintained possession and kept pushing forward.

Robin Gosens' effort was tipped over the bar by Sommer late in the first half but the keeper was beaten when Havertz charged into the box and fired home the equaliser in the 55th.

Germany coach Joachim Loew reverted to a four-man defence for the game but it kept leaking goals as the Swiss went back in front in the 57th after Neuer made consecutive saves from Haris Seferovic before Gavranovic pounced to drill in on the rebound.

A sensational Serge Gnabry back heel flick on the hour pulled the home side level once more and the Swiss then finished the match with 10 men following the stoppage-time dismissal of defender Fabian Schaer for a second booking.

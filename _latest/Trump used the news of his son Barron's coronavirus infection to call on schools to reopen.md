</p><p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/521122-trump-cites-barron-trumps-coronavirus-case-in-arguing-for-schools-to">According to The Hill</a>, Trump added: "And he had it for such a short period of time. I don't even think he knew he had it because they're young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off 99.9%. And Barron is beautiful, and he's free, free."</p><p>He then said schools should reopen their campuses: "It happens. People have it, and it goes. Get the kids back to school. We've got to get them back to school."</p><p>The president has publicly downplayed the effects of the coronavirus for months and has continued to do so after his infection earlier this month.</p>

<p>Many schools have reopened across the country, while others have stayed closed or offered a mix of virtual and in-person learning. Some schools have closed again after outbreaks.</p><p>The Hill reported that Barron's private school in Washington, DC, has conducted only virtual classes so far this school year.</p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/symptoms.html">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines say</a> that while children appear to get less sick from the virus, they can still be infected with it and spread it to others.</p><p>"Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all," the CDC says. "However, some children can get severely ill from COVID-19. They might require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe. In rare cases, they might die."</p><p>

<p>The president also said of children in July: "There may be a case &#8212; a tiny, a tiny fraction of death, tiny fraction &#8212; and they get better very quickly.</p><p>"I think schools have to open. We want to get our economy going."</p><p>He also <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/22/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus-briefing-july-22/index.html">said in July</a> that "a lot of people" say children "don't transmit" the coronavirus, a claim disputed by many experts.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-cdc-school-guidelines-delayed-trump-old-ones-too-strict-2020-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">Trump has been pushing for schools to reopen</a> since the summer and threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don't start teaching students in person again in the fall.</p>

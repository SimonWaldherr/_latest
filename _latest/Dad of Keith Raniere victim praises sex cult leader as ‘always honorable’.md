  Dad of Keith Raniere victim praises sex cult leader as ‘always honorable’ 
description: > 
  A man whose daughter testified about being groomed as a sex slave for Keith Raniere continues to support the Nxivm leader — even praising him as “always honorable” in court documents unsealed Tuesday.The father, identified only by his first name Héctor, wrote a glowing letter about Raniere to a Brooklyn federal judge, crediting the Svengali-like figure’s teachings with inspiring him to run for four marathons.In May 2019, Héctor’s daughter Daniela — who hails from Mexico — recalled on the stand how Raniere allegedly “groomed” her for sex on her 18th birthday — but balked because she wasn’t thin enough.Héctor was one of dozens of supporters who penned gushing letters of support for Raniere ahead of his sentencing for sex-trafficking next week, where he faces life in prison.Now in her 30s, Daniela ended up joining a 80-plus-plaintiff lawsuit from January that alleged that Raniere and his upstate cult swindled followers out of their life savings and forced them into sexual slavery.

<div><p>A man whose daughter <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/23/nxivm-slave-says-joining-sex-cult-derailed-her-life-it-was-a-lie/">testified about being groomed</a> as a sex slave for Keith Raniere continues to support the Nxivm leader &#8212; even praising him as &#8220;always honorable&#8221; in court documents unsealed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The father, identified only by his first name H&#233;ctor, wrote a glowing letter about Raniere to a Brooklyn federal judge, crediting the Svengali-like figure&#8217;s teachings with inspiring him to run for four marathons.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I think of him the words that come to mind are: Honest, Whole, Brilliant Intelligence,&#8221; H&#233;ctor wrote, &#8220;always ready to help, Cheerful and In Love with Humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stream of admiration came despite Raniere being <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/19/jurors-reach-verdict-in-nxivm-sex-cult-leader-keith-ranieres-trial/">convicted last year</a>&#160;of racketeering and sex-trafficking charges for running a master-slave group within his self-help organization called DOS, in which women were&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/15/this-is-how-nxivm-leader-keith-raniere-allegedly-branded-his-slaves/">branded with his initials</a>&#160;like cattle and forced to have sex with him.</p>
<p>In May 2019, H&#233;ctor&#8217;s daughter Daniela &#8212; who hails from Mexico &#8212; recalled on the stand how Raniere allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/23/nxivm-sex-cult-master-keith-raniere-couldnt-get-it-up-witness/">&#8220;groomed&#8221; her for sex</a> on her 18th birthday &#8212; but balked because she wasn&#8217;t thin enough.</p>
<p>She then described how she and her two sisters all had sexual relationships with the self-help guru in their teens and early 20s.</p>
<p>Daniela testified in detail about how she was held for two years in a room with only a foam mattress and a pad of paper and pen <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/28/nxivm-leader-shunned-slave-after-she-kissed-another-man-testimony/">as punishment for kissing another man</a> &#8212; saying she contemplated killing herself by drinking cleaning supplies during her captivity.</p>
<p>Daniela&#8217;s parents,&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/28/nxivm-leader-shunned-slave-after-she-kissed-another-man-testimony/">who had become Nxivm devotees</a>, had immigrated from Mexico and moved into the home where she was confined, near the group&#8217;s upstate headquarters.</p>
<p>When Daniela, who was in the country illegally, finally fled the room in 2012 and confronted Raniere, she said her own dad drove her to the U.S.-Mexico border and dumped her there with no documentation&#160;and the equivalent of $75 in pesos, and she walked back to her home country alone to start her life over.</p>
<p>In his letter, her dad claimed that Daniela had been a troubled teen and that the family decided to follow Raniere&#8217;s advice to keep her in the room in their house so she could &#8220;think about what [she] really wanted,&#8221; adding that she &#8220;could leave at any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was intended to be a short time to think things over turned into something very long (about two years) with no change in Daniela&#8217;s destructive attitude; constant requests for more opportunities and tireless broken promises,&#8221; H&#233;ctor claimed.</p>
<p>He continued to throw his child under the bus, writing: &#8220;Daniela was not willing to change her behavior from not putting in effort, lying and being a burden to the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The perception of this single event is so twisted and wrong that it makes it impossible for Keith to get a fair trial with this lie at trial,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>H&#233;ctor was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/nxvim-leader-keith-ranieres-fans-gush-about-his-volleyball-games/">one of dozens of supporters</a> who penned gushing letters of support for Raniere ahead of his <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/nxivm-cult-leader-keith-raniere-demands-new-trial/">sentencing for sex-trafficking</a> next week, where he faces life in prison.</p>
<p>Now in her 30s, Daniela ended up <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/29/former-nxivm-members-file-suit-against-leaders-alleging-sexual-slavery-forced-labor/">joining a 80-plus-plaintiff lawsuit</a> from January that alleged that Raniere and his upstate cult swindled followers out of their life savings and forced them into sexual slavery.</p>

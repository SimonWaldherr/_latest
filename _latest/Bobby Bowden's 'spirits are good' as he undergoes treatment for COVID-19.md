The news continues to be positive as Florida State coaching legend Bobby Bowden undergoes treatment for COVID-19 at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare.

"His spirits are good, he sounds good and he looks good,” Bowden’s wife Ann told the Democrat Friday morning. “All I can do is hope and pray he gets over this.”

While Ann Bowden has not been able to visit her husband under the hospital's COVID-19 policies, she talked to him Thursday evening on the telephone.

Ann indicated her husband “wants to come home,” but she said physicians want to continue to monitor Bowden’s oxygen levels over the weekend.

Ann is hopeful Bowden will be released from the hospital early next week.

"I was hoping he'd come home (sooner), but he needs to be there so they can watch him," she said, adding with a laugh, "Doctors don't make house calls anymore."

Bowden, who turns 91 next month, was readmitted into the hospital last Tuesday for fatigue. Bowden had been released from the hospital and its rehab facility on Thursday, Oct. 1 after undergoing treatment for a leg infection for nearly two weeks.

Bowden told the Democrat on Monday he had not exhibited any symptoms associated with COVID-19 after being informed Saturday that he had tested positive.

Also on Tuesday, FSU announced that university President John Thrasher and his wife Jean had tested positive for COVID-19. The statement said both are feeling well.

<div><p>China&#8217;s economy grows 4.9%; &#8216;Situation is critical&#8217; in Italy, says PM; restrictions ease in Australian city of Melbourne</p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert and sidelined White House coronavirus taskforce member, has said he was &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; surprised that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" class="u-underline">Donald Trump</a> contracted coronavirus, as Joe Biden warned that the coronavirus outbreak was worsening.</p>
<p>In an interview with 60 Minutes aired on Sunday, shortly before Trump held a rally in Nevada, Fauci said: &#8220;I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask.&#8221;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr" class="tweet-body">Dr. Fauci says he was &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; surprised that President Trump got sick with coronavirus after seeing POTUS at what &#8220;turned out to be a super-spreader event&#8221; at the White House. <a href="https://t.co/Iq75GoCErk" class="u-underline">https://t.co/Iq75GoCErk</a> <a href="https://t.co/iDWEaoX582" class="u-underline">pic.twitter.com/iDWEaoX582</a></p>

<p>Fauci also said the White House had been controlling his media appearances. </p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly have not been allowed to go on many, many, many shows that have asked for me,&#8221; Fauci said, adding that the restrictions had been inconsistent.</p>
<p>At Trump&#8217;s rally, the president claimed that the US was &#8220;rounding the turn&#8221; of the pandemic, a common claim at his appearances, despite the weekly case average rising in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/18/us-coronavirus-cases-surges-most-states" class="u-underline">48 of the country&#8217;s 50 states</a>.

The US has 8.1m cases and nearly 220,000 deaths.</p>

<p>Once considered a battleground, Nevada has not swung for a Republican presidential contender since 2004.</p>
<p>Trump also mocked his Democratic opponent for listening to scientists.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d listen to the scientists we would right now have a country that would be in a massive depression instead of &#8211; we&#8217;re like a rocket ship, look at the numbers,&#8221; said Trump.</p>
<p>Biden meanwhile, campaigned in North Carolina on Sunday, another key state. At a drive-in rally in Durham, he responded to Trump&#8217;s repeated claims that the US had turned a corner in the pandemic: &#8220;As my grandfather would say, this guy&#8217;s gone around the bend if he thinks we&#8217;ve turned the corner. Turning the corner? Things are getting worse,&#8221; Biden said.</p>
<p>In <strong>China</strong>, the economy grew by 4.9% on-year in the third quarter, sustaining its rebound the worst of the pandemic, official figures showed on Monday.</p>
<p>The figure was slightly below expectations in the July-September period, National Bureau of Statistics data showed, while cautioning of uncertainty ahead as &#8220;the international environment is still complicated&#8221;.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s recovery has so far put it on track to be the only major economy expanding this year, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts, while nations around the world continue to struggle with lockdowns and new waves of infections.</p>
<p>On Monday Beijing reported 13 new coronavirus cases, the same as a day earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Europe</strong>&#8217;s death toll has passed 250,000, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. It came as <strong>Italy&#8217;</strong>s mayors were given new coronavirus powers amid a record case rise. Among the powers is the ability to impose 9pm curfews in their towns and cities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy" class="u-underline">Italy</a> reported a record figure of 11,705 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours, the health ministry has said, up from the previous peak of 10,925 posted on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation is critical. The government is there but everyone must do their part,&#8221; Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. He said the government would consider closing gyms and swimming pools after further checks on security protocols this week.<br><br></p>

<div><p></p><p>Hello, everybody, and welcome to our weekly chat. The big news is the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearing, but there's not much suspense. Spoiler alert: She's going to be confirmed, because Republicans have the votes. Barrett is poised and practiced, and unlikely to slip up in any meaningful way. The only surprise so far is that Democrats have been so disciplined in keeping the focus on health care and the ACA. They're taking lemons and making lemonade -- getting a conservative Supreme Court justice rammed down their throats, but scoring political points just three weeks before Election Day. Republicans seem to understand this is not favorable terrain for them, but there's nothing they can do about it -- just as there's nothing Democrats can do about the fact that Barrett is going to be on the court. Meanwhile, President Trump is campaigning frantically as he faces polls that are catastrophic for his reelection chances. And he says he's now "immune" to covid-19 and wants to kiss everybody. Hang in there, everybody. More than 10 million people have already voted. If you haven't, do so now. Let's get started.</p>

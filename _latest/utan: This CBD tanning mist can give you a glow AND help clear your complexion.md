Let's face it, 2020 hasn't been great for getting our annual holiday tans.

But while we haven't been able to go on our beach breaks to get our Vit D fix, there are still some reasons to keep a sunny disposition.

One of them is utan. 2020 has given us all a lot more time to enjoy a bit of much-deserved self-care and skincare lovers have found their new icon in the brand's smash hit CBD tanning water.

Not only does it provide that sunkissed glow we all covet (especially as the weather is freezing), but it also helps soothe inflamed skin and reduce the appearance of blemishes.

The beauty mad among us are so head-over-heels with the product, which was co-created by self-tan guru Jamie Genevieve, it has been selling out within five minutes of being restocked.

Now it's back on the shelves, we’ve asked three woman to share their stories - and it seems they would never be without this 'miracle' complexion corrector…

Skin study 1: Caitlin Macloed, 22, a staff nurse from Marybank

Caitlin has dealt with problem skin and painful breakouts for years - and felt like she'd tried every product on the market before trying utan's CBD tanning water

My struggle

'Since the age of 13/14 I’ve really struggled with problem skin and I can't remember when I last didn't have breakouts.

'Most of the time it would be just red raw, and there'd be blister-like sores and blemishes all over my face. I've tried everything under the sun and nothing seemed to really help.

How it affected me

'Anyone who has acne will know the huge knock it can put on anyone’s confidence. When my skin was at its worst, I wouldn’t leave the house without make-up, which of course didn’t help my skin. I would put on as many layers as needed to try and hide the evidence that my skin was anything but perfect.

At school, you worry so much about what other people think, and the fact you have bad skin can leave you so open to many nasty and negative comments.

Caitlin felt constantly of her skin and admits it massively affected her confidence

My triggers

'Most women would agree with me when I say that periods and changes in hormones has a huge impact on my skin.

'Also, with being in nursing, our work environment is usually quite hot and sweaty, which tends to leave my skin really oily.

'And , course, with the current pandemic, having to wear masks all the time while I’m at work, I'm now prone to the dreaded “mascne”!'

Why utan?

'I started using utan because I love a tan, but putting fake tan on my face, regardless of how often I did my skin care, was causing more harm than good. It was clogging my pores, contributing to me having even more oily skin and causing more breakouts.

'When I discovered that utan had the tanning mist I was skeptical as to how it would work. But after research I found that it was supposed to help people with acne and I was willing to try anything.'

'Putting fake tan on my face was clogging my pores and causing more breakouts… I was sceptical with utan, but I was willing to try anything’ : After using utan for several months, Caitlin reveals her skin is glowing and breakouts have been significantly reduced

My results

'I see a huge difference in my face. I constantly have a glow, and one that looks natural.

'There’s no orange tinge that you can tell it’s a fake tan and just looks like you've been in the sun for a few hours.

'The mist is so lightweight it feels like there’s nothing even on my face. It’s helped reduce the amount of spots I get massively. After one night of using it I noticed the glow - and after about a week I noticed how it was helping with my skin.

'Personally, I think this is an affordable product which is going to encourage people to be more confident within themselves and appreciate the skin that they have.'

Skin study 2: Chanel Wakefield, 29, beauty therapist from Norfolk

Chanel started suffering from severe breakouts in her twenties and trialed every product she could through her job as a beauty therapist

My struggle

'I've suffered with acne from the age of 25 and tried so many products - it's part of my job.

'But even after trialing everything - even medication - I'm still prone to random breakouts.

How it affected me

'I used to hate leaving the house if my breakouts were really bad.

'I’m a person who lives for fake tan and make-up, so when I couldn’t wear any as my skin was too sore, I needed something else to help with my confidence.

Chanel felt insecure and her skin was sometimes so painful she struggled to use make-up to cover her break-outs

Why utan?

'I love fake tan and have never found one for my face that wasn’t to heavy or wouldn’t cause blackheads or further breakouts or go blotchy. I saw utan online and went to buy it the next day.

'Now, I'd never use another tan for my face!'

‘I’d never use another tan for my face!’ The 29-year-old now feels confident to go with and without make-up after using utan and seeing her breakouts calm down and her glow increase

The results

'The tan was amazing and after a couple of days, I noticed a difference in my skin. It helped reduce inflammation and calm down the redness of spots.

'This is a product I can’t live without now. It’s just amazing. I wear this everyday. I apply at night and small amount with my makeup as the glow is unreal. Anyone who suffers with breakouts or acne or loves fake tan needs this in their life.'

Skin study 3: Hettie, 28, healthcare worker from Lincolnshire

Hettie's confidence was at rock bottom when her skin was at its worst earlier this year

My struggle

'I've suffered from spots and red areas on my face for as long as I can remember. I feel like I've tried every product imaginable.

How it affected me

'It has massively hit my confidence - I feel like I cannot go out without make-up and even when I'm wearing it, I'm conscious that you can see the spots underneath. It makes me want to hide my skin.'

My triggers

'I notice I suffer from breakouts when I'm stressed, hormonal or when I eat junk food.'

Why utan?

'I first heard about utan while reading reviews of it on social media. Everyone was saying that it gave you a gradual tan but the bit that really interested me was that people were saying it helped cleared their skin. I thought I'd give it a go and I've been addicted every since!'

‘I’ve recommended it to everyone!': Within a month of using the CBD tanning water, the healthcare worker found that her skin was remarkably different

The results

'I think I saw a difference within the first 2 weeks but my complexion looked dramatically different within a month. I've recommended it to everyone!'

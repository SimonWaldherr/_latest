<div><p>A California homeowner says dog poop was thrown at his front door in what he believes was a targeted attack for displaying a sign supporting Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>The incident was captured on surveillance video at 3 a.m. Wednesday morning in Roseville, California, <a href="https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/10/21/dog-feces-roseville-home-blm-signs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to CBS 13 Sacramento</a>.</p>
<p>The bag of feces can be heard striking the porch in the footage as a man and his unleashed German Shepard walk past the house.</p>
<p>Homeowner Anthony Taula-Lieras said the incident has his family on edge as they believe it could be because of the BLM sign on their front lawn.</p>
<p>He told the station his five-year-old daughter even asked him, &#8220;Daddy did someone put poop on our door because of our sign?&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;And we are a little more on edge to think, &#8216;in our community, are we ultimately as safe as we thought we were?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Taula-Lieras believes a neighbor is responsible &#8212; but says he would be willing to open a dialogue with that person and forgive them.</p>
<p>However, if it happens again, he said he would press charges.</p>

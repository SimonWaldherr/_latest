  Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing: Welcome to the world's wildest intersection 
description: > 
  Tokyo (CNN) — Often referred to as the world's busiest crosswalk, thousands of pedestrians scramble across Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing daily.The Shibuya Crossing serves as center-stage for a Times Square-inspired New Year's Eve countdown and is the focal point for the wild Halloween celebrations that have grown increasingly famous in recent years.Along with Shinjuku Station, the district's Shibuya Station bears the honor of being one of the world's busiest train stations.Hachikō the dog was an akita who would meet his owner Hidesaburō Ueno at the Shibuya Station after work every day in the 1920s.While there is certainly no shortage of amazing Shibuya views, the best place to connect to the spirit of the Shibuya Crossing is the street itself.

<div><p class="dropcap">When Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, he launched a movement to restore the promise of America.</p><p>Since taking office, President Trump has delivered record-breaking results for all Americans. For decades, president after president, Republican and Democrat alike, failed to execute the agenda that they promised voters. For the last four years, I have stood with President Trump as he kept his promises to the American people, even when facing unprecedented attacks from the permanent Washington political class and their allies in the mainstream media.</p><h1 class="cta-headline">USA TODAY Editorial Board: Elect Joe Biden.

Because of the strong foundation established through his economic policies before the global pandemic, America is on track to bounce back bigger and better than ever before.</p><p>President Trump led a historic whole-of-government approach to combat this devastating pandemic. He took bold and decisive action by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-members-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/" target="_blank">suspending travel from China</a>. This example of strong leadership saved countless American lives, and we launched one of the largest mobilizations of public and private sector resources since World War II.</p><p>President Trump secured direct economic payments to help the countless Americans who are hurting due to the pandemic.

Our <a href="https://republicans-armedservices.house.gov/news/defense-drumbeat/services-outline-readiness-crisis" target="_blank">military was depleted</a> by the Obama-Biden administration. Radical Islamic terrorism was on the rise. Four years later, we have met every challenge head on, reestablishing American dominance.</p><p>President Trump rebuilt our military to keep Americans safe.

President Trump and I know that we don&#8217;t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our minority communities. Under President Trump&#8217;s leadership, we have been doing both for&#160;3 1/2&#160;years. But Joe Biden has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4CLoiA3vfQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1230" target="_blank">voiced support for cutting and redirecting</a> core police funding, and he&#160;would <a href="https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf" target="_blank">double down</a> on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisdorsey/2020/10/13/some-experts-warn-that-joe-bidens-cashless-bail-policy-is-a-prescription-for-more-anarchy/#66f3890e7a7f" target="_blank">policies</a> that have led to violence across our major cities.

Thankfully, we have a president with the toughness, energy&#160;and resolve to ensure that America&#8217;s best days still lie ahead. A vote to reelect President Trump is a vote for a safer, stronger&#160;and more prosperous America.</p><p>Mike Pence is vice president of the United States.</p></div>

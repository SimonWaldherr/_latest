  England's Covid-19 outbreak grows 64% in a week 
description: > 
  Their 'gloomy' warning came as Britain recorded another 15,650 cases - 13 per cent higher than the 13,864 recorded last Friday.Separate official data also revealed almost a third of England's councils saw a drop in coronavirus infections last week, amid calls for a second circuit-breaker lockdown and tightening restrictions across the country.England's R rate was estimated to be between 1.3 and 1.6 on October 2 but the range has since dropped to 1.2 to 1.4.As many as 41 out of 149 councils recorded a fall in their Covid-19 infection rates in the week ending October 11, according to Public Health England's weekly surveillance report.Estimates from Cambridge University and PHE researchers project that the current trajectory of England's outbreak could lead to 500 deaths per day by November.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">'The very broad message is much the same gloomy one as in last week&#8217;s ONS bulletin,' said Professor Kevin McConway, a professor of statistics at the Open University.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The estimate of the number of people in the whole English community population that would test positive for the virus has continued to increase, with no clear sign that the rate of increase is slowing.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The same is true for the estimate of the daily number of new infections.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'What's new is that, in two of these regions [North East and Yorkshire &amp; The Humber] there are signs that the increases are levelling off.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'ONS, rightly in my view, urge caution about interpreting these signs &#8211; there&#8217;s quite a lot of statistical uncertainty in the numbers, and a levelling off over just one week might not indicate a more permanent slowing, let alone a clear downturn.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But at least it's a spark of light amongst the gloom.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes as Boris Johnson today demanded Greater Manchester leaders focus on 'saving lives' as he hailed an agreement with Lancashire to move into the toughest lockdown level.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PM - who will address the country again at a 4pm press conference - sent a stark message to mayor Andy Burnham and Tory 'Red Wall' MPs after a deal was announced to extend Tier Three curbs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lancashire joins Liverpool as the only areas in the top bracket, which means all bars and pubs that do not serve meals must shut - as well as a ban on household mixing indoors and in gardens. Thousands of venues are expected to be closed from midnight tonight, with casinos, betting shops and car boot sales given another 48 hours' grace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, there was anger in Liverpool that it has been made to close down gyms and leisure centres, while they can stay open in Lancashire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Department of Health said there would be a &#163;12million support package in Lancashire as well as more money for an economic recovery 'task force' over the next six months. Local sources claimed in total it could be worth &#163;30million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the standoff over Greater Manchester looks to be deepening, with the government warning it will not be 'held over a barrel' by Mr Burnham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Burnham reiterated his demand for more financial support today, after saying the North was being treated like a 'sacrificial lamb' and a 'canary in the coalmine' with experimental restrictions. He has claimed that if London - which enters Tier Two from tomorrow - was in the same position there would be a nationwide clampdown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But speaking to reporters this afternoon, Mr Johnson warned that efforts to extract the maximum money from government will not work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is about saving lives,' he said. 'This is about us joining together locally and nationally to get the R down, to make these regional restrictions, this tiering system, work and to save lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Everybody in Greater Manchester and all the areas that are still finding it difficult should think about it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'I'd much rather not impose things, I'd much rather that we were able to work out something together with local authorities, with the mayor in Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But it is up to local leaders to show the kind of leadership that we have seen in Liverpool, in Lancashire and in London.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson is also facing mounting pressure from his own SAGE experts to trigger a 'circuit breaker' squeeze across the country over half-term - with one scientist even suggesting the process might need to be repeated again and again until a vaccine becomes available.</p></div>

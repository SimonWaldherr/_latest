She's been away from social media since revealing that she and her husband John Legend lost their baby Jack in late September.

But Chrissy Teigen hinted she might be ready for a full return to the medium she has dominated for years after writing an Instagram comment on Saturday.

The 34-year-old model wrote that she was grateful to have something to laugh about in a comment on Betches Media's account.

The account specializes in reposting comic posts from around the web, particularly from Twitter.

One tweet from Kara Morehart managed to get a laugh out of the Lip Sync Battle star.

'Just booked an eyebrow waxing appointment and I'm excited I'll be wearing a mask so I don't have to hear "mustache too?" she joked in the original tweet, while the new post added, 'It's the little things...'

'Finally, a giggle. Thank you,' Chrissy commented on the post.

Time to be alone: Dozens of commenters wished Chrissy well after her comment appeared. She has been silent since sharing her stillbirth on September 30

Chrissy's comment set off dozens of commentators who rushed to share their well wishes.

'We love you so much, Chrissy,' one follower wrote, according to Us Weekly, and others said they would keep her family in their prayers.

Chrissy shared the sad news that she had suffered a stillbirth in a heartbreaking post from September 30 featuring moving black-and-white photos of her grieving in a hospital room.

'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before. We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn’t enough,' she wrote.

The Bring The Funny judge shared that she and John had begun calling the baby boy Jack, even though they had previously waited until just after she gave birth to name their other children Luna, four, and Miles, two.

'To our Jack — I’m so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn’t give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you,' she continued.

'We are so grateful for the life we have, for our wonderful babies Luna and Miles, for all the amazing things we’ve been able to experience. But everyday can’t be full of sunshine. On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it.'

Forever Jack: 'We never decide on our babies’ names until the last possible moment after they’re born, just before we leave the hospital. But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack,' explained Teigen

Disbelief: Shortly after uploading her sad news to Instagram, Chrissy took to her Twitter page to further express her shock

In the days leading up to the stillbirth, Chrissy shared that she was on 'serious bed rest' due to ongoing bleeding.

Despite the pregnancy complications, she kept up an optimistic demeanor on social media and repeatedly said Jack was 'strong' and doing well despite the bleeding.

After sharing her heartbreaking news, Chrissy expressed her shock at the turn of events on Twitter.

'Driving home from the hospital with no baby. How can this be real,' she wrote.

John also took to Twitter to share Chrissy's post, while writing, 'We love you, Jack,' alongside five black hearts.

Although there has been some swivel-eyed hyperbole about Johnson being “finished”, right-minded Tories have no desire to “blow up” his administration before it even completes its first year since the December general election. So, an alternative plan is being hatched.

Protecting the PM

It would see Mr Cummings sidelined to focus solely on civil service reform while a new “chief of staff” is brought in to form a “protective ring of steel” around the Prime Minister.

“Dom is not going to go – that’s close to impossible,” added the minister. “But if there’s a counterbalancing force who the PM starts to listen to, who has actually got his back, then we could start to find a way out of this mess.”

The appointment of former Guardian journalist Allegra Stratton as Downing Street’s new press secretary is being hailed by some Tories as part of the solution.

Unimpressed with No 10’s media operation, they are agitating for director of communications Lee Cain to focus on reforming cross-governmental comms, leaving Stratton to fight the Prime Minister's corner on a day-to-day basis. Well-liked Mr Cain, a former Mirror journalist, is already working on a project to cut all department press offices down to 30 staff.

Comparisons have already been made between the last six months and the first chaotic year of Mr Johnson’s mayoralty, when he was forced to fire four of his 12 appointed advisers within weeks of taking office.

Change is needed

As the recent rebellion over the coronavirus rules has shown, Tories from all wings of the party are now galvanised behind the idea that change is needed, and fast.

Mr Cummings is aware of what he describes as “the party management problem” but seemingly oblivious to the idea he might be the cause. “Cummings hates Tory MPs and everyone knows it,” said one backbencher. “Yet what the Prime Minister seems to have failed to realise is that the parliamentary party will always be more loyal to him than Cummings ever will.”

Briefing against Cummings

Tories have always briefed aggressively against Mr Cummings – but these attacks have stepped up in recent days in a bid to destabilise his relationship with the Prime Minister, who gave him “special powers” when he appointed him as his “enforcer” in July 2019.

There has been much talk of Mr Cummings “cosying up to Rishi Sunak” as the Chancellor has been touted as a potential successor amid suggestions that he has even distanced himself from Mr Gove, his closest ministerial ally.

A rumour has even been going around that Mr Cummings gave Mr Johnson the same speech on the economy he offered to Mr Gove and Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, during last year’s Tory leadership race as evidence of his supposed double dealing.

Naturally MPs have been lapping up such stories, hoping they will get back to Prime Minster as evidence of Mr. Cummings’ disloyalty.

Despite chairing the Covid-19 ‘Ops’ committee, Mr Gove has recently been complaining about a “lack of access”, according to two separate sources. It follows reports that Mr Sunak wants local lockdowns to be decided by a committee comprising himself, Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

Dom's 'frat house'

But MPs and ministers are also growing increasingly concerned about the narrow sphere of opinion reaching “the boss”.

Following his own departure from No 10 in February, Tim Montgomerie, the former editor of the influential Conservative Home website, described the Downing Street operation as “Dom’s frat house”, where dissent was treated with “retribution” and earning the disfavour of Mr Cummings was “fatal”.

“Everyone was dispensable,” he wrote. “Except Dom.” It came amid reports of Mr Johnson’s chief strategic adviser Sir Edward Lister having been sidelined – along with anyone else who used to advise him at City Hall.

The return of Levido

Isaac Levido, who spearheaded Mr Johnson’s 80-seat majority general election win, was rehired in March to sharpen the Government’s coronavirus response but suddenly returned to the private sector in July.

Now there are some in cabinet calling for Mr Levido to return to the fold to help to restore Mr Johnson’s reputation as his approval rating continues on a downward trajectory. “Isaac Levido is a name that inspires confidence at the top of the Tory party. As soon as he left, the Covid-19 strategy went completely downhill.

“You need to have someone in there who hasn’t just got the Prime Minster's confidence, but the confidence of MPs. That person isn’t Dominic Cummings. However, a lot of cabinet ministers are behind the civil service reform that Dom has been doing.”

Whether Mr Levido, who is a protege of Mr Johnson’s former election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, would return to No 10 remains to be seen.

Timing wise, Tories are desperately pinning their hopes on a reshuffle and reset after the transition period ends on December 31, when they hope Mr Cummings “will have served his purpose”.

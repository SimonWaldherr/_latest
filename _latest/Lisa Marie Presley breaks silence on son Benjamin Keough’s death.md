<div><p>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</p><p>Lisa Marie Presley has revealed the pain she&#8217;s in following the death of her son Benjamin Keough is &#8220;suffocating and bottomless&#8221;.</p>
<p>Presley broke her silence to mark what would have been her son&#8217;s 28th birthday on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sharing a photo of Keough about to blow out the candles on a birthday cake, Presley wrote: &#8220;My beautiful beautiful angel. I worshipped the ground you walked on, on this earth and now in Heaven. My heart and soul went with you.</p>
<p>&#8220;The depth of the pain is suffocating and bottomless without you every moment of every day. I will never be the same. Please wait for me my love, and hold my hand while I stay to continue to protect and raise your little sisters and to be here for Riley. I know you would want that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;Happy Birthday my sweet sweet Boy. You were much too good for this world.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/02/benjamin-keough-buried-alongside-grandfather-elvis-presley-at-graceland/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keough died on July 12</a> at his home in Calabasas, CA. following a self-inflicted gunshot wound. <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/07/14/benjamin-keoughs-death-ruled-a-suicide-by-shotgun-wound/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">His death was ruled a suicide</a> by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office.</p>
<p>He was Presley&#8217;s second child with musician Danny Keough, following their daughter, actress Riley, who on Wednesday <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGnG4WSFGtp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared a slideshow to Instagram</a> which included two photos of her and her brother from her 2015 wedding to stuntman Ben Smith-Peterson, one throwback photo of her and her brother on a ride as kids at what looks like a fair and one photo of her brother standing in front of a fence as a little boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy Birthday beautiful angel,&#8221; Riley captioned the post, adding a heart and two storm cloud emojis, likely in reference to Benjamin&#8217;s middle name being Storm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in her Instagram Story, Riley also shared what Benjamin&#8217;s girlfriend, Diana Pinto, whom he dated since at least September 2017, posted for his birthday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy birthday my love,&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGnEmJPgkVt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pinto captioned a slideshow of her own</a>, which featured several photos of her and Benjamin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much to say just a really hard day, And isn&#8217;t it ironic World Series Tampa Bay v Dodgers this year, I bet you&#8217;re getting a kick outta that. I love you.&#8221;</p>

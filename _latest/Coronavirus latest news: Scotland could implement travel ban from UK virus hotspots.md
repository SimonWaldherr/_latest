Nicola Sturgeon has advised Scots against travelling to high-risk areas of England as she singled out Blackpool as "associated with a large and growing number of Covid cases in Scotland".

Ms Sturgeon also said she backs Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford's call for the UK Government to introduce travel restrictions to prevent movement of people from areas of high prevalence into other UK nations.

She said she will be writing to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to "seek urgent talks" on the issue.

The First Minister said: "We are currently advising against non-essential travel to the parts of England which are classed as very high or high alert areas under England's new three-tier system.

"And I'm asking people from these areas not to travel to Scotland either."

This morning, the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford said: "We of course have the opportunity to put in place appropriate public health measures."

Elsewhere, Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Manchester, has said he was not told about strict new coronavirus restrictions that will plunge more than two million of his constituents into lockdown.

Greater Manchester is expected to join Liverpool in the highest tier of measures today after ministers recommended the move to Boris Johnson on Wednesday night.

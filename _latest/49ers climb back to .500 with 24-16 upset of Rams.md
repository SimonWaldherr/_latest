	<p>The Rams have four victories. All four came against the NFC East.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Rams, they don&#8217;t play in the NFC East.</p>
<p>The Rams fell to 0-2 against teams outside the NFC East, losing 24-16 to the 49ers. San Francisco improved to 3-3 in the first of a brutal seven-game stretch.</p>
<p>The 49ers jumped out to a 21-6 halftime lead and held on without running back <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/11827/raheem-mostert" target="_blank">Raheem Mostert</a>, who left with an ankle injury after one carry in the second half. </p>
<p>After the two-minute warning, <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/51535/deebo-samuel" target="_blank">Deebo Samuel</a> took a flip pass from <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/11888/jimmy-garoppolo" target="_blank">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> that was more a rush than a catch and picked up 11 yards on third-and-seven to ensure the Rams wouldn&#8217;t see the ball again.</p>
<p>Garoppolo, who rebounded from last week when he lasted only 31 plays because of his ankle injury, went 23-of-33 for 268 yards and three touchdowns. <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/11895/george-kittle" target="_blank">George Kittle</a> had seven catches for 109 yards and a touchdown, and Samuel made six receptions for 66 yards and a score.</p>
<p>The biggest plays of the game came late in the third quarter after the Rams reached the San Francisco 2. On third down, <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/9293/cooper-kupp" target="_blank">Cooper Kupp</a> dropped what should have been a touchdown pass from <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/9277/jared-goff" target="_blank">Jared Goff</a>.</p>
<p>The Rams elected to go for it on fourth down, and Goff&#8217;s pass, intended for <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/9283/josh-reynolds" target="_blank">Josh Reynolds</a>, was picked by <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/9028/jason-verrett" target="_blank">Jason Verrett</a>. It was Verrett&#8217;s first interception since Sept. 11, 2016, against <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/12699/alex-smith" target="_blank">Alex Smith</a> and the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Goff finished 19-of-38 for 198 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.</p>
<p>After making four sacks last season, <a class="nameLink" href="https://www.rotoworld.com/football/nfl/player/9301/aaron-donald" target="_blank">Aaron Donald</a> had only two tackles and a quarterback hit.</p>

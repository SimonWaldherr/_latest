The lovebirds have been together ever since and moved into a Â£1.3million flat in Cheshire.

Last month, the blonde beauty was forced to deny cheating on Tommy when she shared her bed with a male friend on Monday evening.

Taking to YouTube, the star filmed herself in a bathrobe with her hairdresser pal Jay Birmingham in the background yet assured fans she was not playing away while her sportsman boyfriend, also 21, is on a six week road trip with his boxer brother Tyson.

The star, who also referenced her teddy Elly Belly, reassured fans: 'This is my new boyfriend Jason. I was just saying to him if anyone sees you in the back they're going to be like, 'She's cheating on Tommy!' It's OK. Elly Belly and Jason are together'.

Molly-Mae seemed to predict the speculation surrounding her movements as she quickly pointed out that there was no foul play occurring.

Tommy has set off on a six week road trip with his boxing legend brother Tyson, however earlier this month he was forced to return due to Molly-Mae's yearning.

'You know what, I’m not even gonna beat myself up about it. I’m just gonna eat my breakfast. I’m just gonna eat my breakfast, right?' she said.

'I’m gonna eat my breakfast and then I’m gonna go to a party, because I’m not even gonna think about it. I am not going to think about it, okay?'

Cardi continued: 'Nope, no, I’m not. I won’t, it is what it is, s*** happen. F*** it. It’s not even the first time. I mean I used to f***ing be a stripper so whatever. Ay, Dios mio.'

Offset has been lavishing Cardi with birthday gifts including a brand new Rolls Royce complete with a custom $8,000 car seat for Kulture.

Their affectionate appearances come less than a month after she filed for divorce and later clarified that the split was over 'arguing' rather than 'infidelity.'

The duo the knot in secret in their own bedroom in 2017 and then the following year she went public with the fact they were married.

Cardi was requesting child support, legal costs and custody of their toddler in the divorce case which was slated to come before a court on November 4.

'You cannot hurt my feelings trying to throw the divorce in my face because, at the end of the day, I decided I wanted to leave,' she said on OnlyFans.

She continued: 'I don't have no hatred towards him. And I don't wish him nothing bad and I know that he feels the same way about me.'

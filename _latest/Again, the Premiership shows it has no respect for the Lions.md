<div><p>That alone is the first tinkling of the death knell for such tours. You can&#8217;t properly prepare a Lions team, giving every player a fair crack at claiming a test spot, in five weeks. Hence the Japan game, a fixture I have reservations about anyway. The Lions are a touring team. Part of their mystique is that they only play overseas, a travelling troupe sent on their way.</p>
<p>However, needs must. Warren Gatland is desperate for game time. The Lions administrators are desperate for cash, some of it perhaps to buy off the Premiership. And that is where we are.</p>
<p>It is a grubby, unsavoury affair and does no-one any good. The Premiership should be ashamed of itself. Again. &#160;&#160;</p>

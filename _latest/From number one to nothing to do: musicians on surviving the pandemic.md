On New Year’s Eve 2019, fast rising UK indie band BLOXX were huddled in a London club, waiting for the countdown. Front woman Ophelia Booth formed the band in 2016 while studying music technology in West London and working part-time at her local Wetherspoons.

When their first single, Your Boyfriend, went viral, she took the plunge into music full-time, quitting her job and her degree to support The Wombats and Two Door Cinema Club on tour while preparing their debut album. “This year,” Booth whispered to her bandmates Mozwin, Taz and Paul on the final night of 2019, “is going to be our year. This year is going to make us.”

Three months later, as Covid-19 spread across the globe and flattened life as we know it, BLOXX reeled in collective shock. How could they promote their debut album without touring it? How could they make their music videos without seeing each other? And more importantly, how would they make ends meet?

“The world is officially ending for the arts community. For everyone, f___ boris,” tweeted Booth on the day Rishi Sunak announced live music venues would have to remain closed for a further six months to squash Covid’s second wave, succinctly speaking for thousands of emerging musicians across the country whose entire livelihoods lay in tatters.

“When I heard that announcement, I just saw my future flash before my eyes,” Booth grimaces at me through Zoom from her family home in Oxbridge, where she has been shielding along with her vulnerable mother and little sister. “We had a tour in America booked. We were going to play the main stage at Reading and Leeds Festival this summer. We were going to release our first ever record. We pushed it back but then had no choice but to release it anyway, as next year would have been too late, and no one can see us play it. Next year, we’ll have released our second. So will we just never perform our first? And streaming is not an accurate representation of how well a record does, playlists can be full of bots. We need to see the audience reaction live.”

Le’Veon Bell wasn’t unemployed for long.

After being released by the Jets on Tuesday night, the running back is expected to sign a deal with the Kansas City Chiefs, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.

Bell adds to an already-impressive collection of skill players on the Kansas City offense, though it will likely cut into the workload of rookie running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire. Edwards-Helaire has averaged 16.2 carries per contest thus far and has not scored a touchdown or topped 100 yards on the ground since Week 1.

The Chiefs play the Jets in Week 8.

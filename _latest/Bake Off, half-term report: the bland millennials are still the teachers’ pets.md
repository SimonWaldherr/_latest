<div><p>Cake, Biscuit, Bread, Chocolate and Pastry Weeks have all been tackled and ticked off.&#160; We&#8217;re now <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2020/10/20/great-british-bake-week-5-pastry-week-review-matt-lucas-outshining/">five episodes</a> into the new series of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bake+off+telegraph&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enGB923GB923&amp;oq=bake+off+telegraph&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l3j69i60l3.4022j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">The Great British Bake Off</a>, marking the midway point of the nation&#8217;s favourite foodie contest.&#160;</p>
<p>What better time to run the rule over the 11th series and see how it&#8217;s faring &#8211; top of the class or banished to the naughty step?</p>
<h4><b>The hosts </b></h4>
<p>The departing <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sandi-toksvig/">Sandi Toksvig</a> was replaced by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Matt+Lucas+telegraph&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enGB923GB923&amp;oq=Matt+Lucas+telegraph&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.1919j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Matt Lucas</a> as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Noel+Fielding+telegraph&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enGB923GB923&amp;oq=Noel+Fielding+telegraph&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.1934j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Noel Fielding</a>&#8217;s co-presenter this year. The Little Britain mirth-maker made a splash from the start, kickstarting the series in Boris Johnson garb for a spoof government briefing (&#8220;Stay Alert, Protect Cake, Save Loaves&#8221;).</p>
<p>Worries that an all-male, all-fortysomething hosting duo might upset Bake Off&#8217;s magical alchemy soon proved unfounded. Lucas has provided heart, humour and jolly patterned shirts. He&#8217;s quick to defuse tension by bursting into song or doing a daft voice. He also gets excited by good baking, regularly snaffling treats.</p>
<p>Incumbent presenter Fielding seemed overshadowed and even a little spiky at first, but is gradually returning to top comedic form himself. Lucas is definitely the star pupil &#8211;&#160;Fielding must try harder.</p>

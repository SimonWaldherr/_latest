Billionaire rapper and independent presidential candidate Kanye West focused on religion and faith in his first 2020 campaign ad unveiled Monday.

Standing in front of a black-and-white American flag and looking away from the camera, the superstar-turned-politician spoke of faith, family and American prosperity.

“America. What is America’s destiny? What is best for our nation? Our people? What is just, true justice?” West, 43, asks at the start of the ad, which he debuted on Twitter Monday, “We have to think about all these things together as a people.”

The fashion mogul went on to discuss faith specifically — something that has been a hallmark of his presidential effort.

“To contemplate our future, to live up to our dream, we must have vision. We as a people will revive our nation’s commitment to faith, to what our Constitution calls the free exercise of religion, including, of course, prayer. Through prayer, faith can be restored,” West said.

“We as a people are called to a greater purpose than ourselves. We are not only a beacon to the world, but we should be servants to each other. To encourage each other, to help each other to lift up each other,” he continued.

“Our fellow Americans, that we may all prosper together. We have to act on faith, with the sure knowledge that we are pursuing the right goals and doing the right things. We will build a stronger country by building stronger families. Families are the building blocks of society, of a nation. By turning to faith, we will be the kind of nation, the kind of people God intends us to be,” he said at the end of the 82-second spot.

West’s first ad focusing on faith is not entirely surprising, as the musician has made it a regular topic of discussion since announcing his late-entry White House bid in July.

The rapper has a generally broad campaign platform, with more goals than specific policy initiatives. Police reform, reducing household and student loan debt and bringing prayer back into school are some of his initiatives.

His vice presidential running mate, 57-year-old Michelle Tidball, is a spiritual coach who, like West, lives on a ranch in Cody, Wyoming, and has a deep religious background.

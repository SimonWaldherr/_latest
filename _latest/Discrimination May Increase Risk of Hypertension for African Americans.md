  Discrimination May Increase Risk of Hypertension for African Americans 
description: > 
  A new study says African Americans who face a lifetime of discrimination may be at increased risk of developing high blood pressure, a chronic condition linked to heart attacks, kidney disease and strokes.The study , published Wednesday in Hypertension – an American Heart Association journal – could help explain why African Americans suffer from the issue, also called hypertension, at a disproportionately high rate compared with whites.By the time the follow-ups were completed, 52% of participants had developed high blood pressure.Those who reported high levels of lifetime discrimination had a 34% increased risk compared with those reporting low levels."Lifetime discrimination may act as a chronic stressor to impact physiological function and predispose an individual to adverse health outcomes such as hypertension," she says.

Its findings "highlight the critical importance of addressing discrimination in efforts to reduce health disparities" and negative health outcomes for African Americans, says Allana Forde, the study's first author and a postdoctoral research fellow with the <a href="https://drexel.edu/uhc/">Urban Health Collaborative</a> at <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/drexel-university-3256">Drexel University</a> in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/pennsylvania/philadelphia-county">Philadelphia</a>. </p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">The Photos You Should See - June 2020</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/9a0d1e0/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F53%2Fe6%2F962cb3ca4f79ac667fd45427b731%2Fpods-01.JPG" alt="HOUSTON, TX - JUNE 30: (EDITORIAL USE ONLY)  A medical staff member rests in front of a fan in the Covid-19 intensive care unit at the United Memorial Medical Center on June 30, 2020 in Houston, Texas.

While factors like diet and exercise are strongly correlated with this risk, she says, the medical community has often overlooked important psychosocial factors like race-based bigotry. </p><p>"We hope that our study will help raise awareness and facilitate discussion around the salient role of social factors, like discrimination, in shaping the health of African-descent populations in the U.S.," Forde says.</p><p>Although discrimination and racism are often used interchangeably, "they are not the same" and have important distinctions, Forde says. "Racism often leads to discrimination or unfair treatment. This study focused on interpersonal discrimination and not systemic abuse."</p><p>The new analysis used data culled from 1,845 Black participants enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study, a longitudinal study of cardiovascular disease among African Americans in the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/mississippi/jackson-county">Jackson, Mississippi</a>, area. Participants hadn't been diagnosed with high blood pressure during initial enrollment in 2000 through 2004, when they reported their experiences with unfair treatment, reflected on sliding scales for "everyday" discrimination and "lifetime" discrimination.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>In follow-up visits &#8211; occurring in 2005 to 2008, and between 2009 and 2013 &#8211; study participants were assessed for high blood pressure based on blood-pressure readings or if they were taking related medication.</p><p>By the time the follow-ups were completed, 52% of participants had developed high blood pressure. While everyday discrimination was not associated with incidence of high blood pressure after adjusting for factors like age and other risks for the condition, people who reported medium levels of lifetime discrimination had a 49% higher risk of high blood pressure compared with those who reported low levels. Those who reported high levels of lifetime discrimination had a 34% increased risk compared with those reporting low levels. </p><p>Forde says her study offers more precise evidence on the connection between discrimination and poor health outcomes.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>"Lifetime discrimination may act as a chronic stressor to impact physiological function and predispose an individual to adverse health outcomes such as hypertension," she says. "For example, discrimination can directly impact hypertension by activating the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis through what is referred to as the 'stress pathway.'''</p><p>Some participants had poor health behaviors, like smoking, or were dealing with obesity that put them at risk for hypertension &#8211; but those issues also may be due to the stress of discrimination. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"Discrimination can also lead to unhealthy behaviors such as unhealthy eating and sedentary lifestyles, which can lead to the development of hypertension through more indirect pathways," Forde says.<br></p></div>

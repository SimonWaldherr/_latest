  Iran Is Behind Threatening Emails Sent to Influence Election, U.S. Officials Say 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON — Iran and Russia have both obtained American voter registration data, and Tehran used it to send threatening, faked emails to voters that were aimed at influencing the presidential election, top national security officials announced on Wednesday evening.There was no indication that any election result tallies were changed or that information about who is registered to vote was altered, both of which would threaten to alter actual votes, said John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I.director, in an appearance at the bureau’s headquarters.And it was not clear that either nation hacked into voter registration systems.Some of the spoofed emails, sent to Democratic voters, purported to be from pro-Trump far-right groups, including the Proud Boys.

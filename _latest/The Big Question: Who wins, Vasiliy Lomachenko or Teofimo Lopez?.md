Last week’s Big Question was about bare knuckle boxing, BKFC in particular, and whether or not it will be able to find an audience — not mainstream, almost certainly, but a reliable niche audience, something good enough to support the promotion and the sport in general.

63 percent of you did say yes in the poll, which I think is encouraging. I tuned in on Saturday for BKFC 13, and as always, had a good time watching the show. I do think, and even more hope, that BKFC can find that audience. And personally, if the very idea isn’t a turn-off for you, I really would encourage people to give BKFC a shot sometime. I’ve yet to not be entertained by a show I’ve watched from them, and I really mean that.

But THIS week we get back to the traditional (as we know it now, anyway) side of the sweet science, because this is a big week for “normal” boxing.

And the question for you this week is even more simple than usual: who ya got on Saturday, Vasiliy Lomachenko or Teofimo Lopez?

How to Watch Lomachenko vs Lopez

Date: Saturday, Oct. 17 | Start Time: 10:00 pm ET (Main Card) / 7:30 pm ET (Prelims)

Location: MGM Top Rank Bubble, Las Vegas, NV

TV: ESPN (Main Card) | Stream: ESPN+ (Prelims)

We all know what the fight is, but if you’re kinda new or curious, quick breakdown:

Lomachenko holds the WBA and WBO titles at 135 pounds, is considered the No. 1 fighter in the division, and is also considered by many the No. 1 fighter in the sport today, pound-for-pound. (He tops our rankings at 135 and P4P.) He’s also an amateur legend, legitimately one of the greatest amateur boxers of all time. He’s the older man but not old at 32, but he is also naturally smaller than Lopez, who is a natural lightweight, whereas lightweight is probably Lomachenko pushing his physical limits, having coming into the sport nine pounds south at featherweight. He’s an established star (and a bigger star than some might think) in this fight.

Lopez holds the IBF title at 135 pounds and is considered the No. 2 fighter in the division. While Lomachenko is the established guy, Teofimo is a rising star with superstar potential on the table. He’s charismatic, he’s flashy, he’s probably got some love-him-or-hate-him appeal, and he’s a destructive puncher, but not without skills. He was also an Olympian, though truly not on the same amateur level as Lomachenko.

Otherwise, you all know the fight. You know what we’ve got here. It is, at least for “hardcore” boxing fans, the most anticipated fight of 2020 to date, and may be the most anticipated fight of the year, period. (I don’t see anything else coming up in the next two months, in all honesty.)

We’ll have a deeper preview on Thursday and our staff predictions on Friday, but now it’s your turn to fire off your thoughts. WHO WINS?

YouTube star Erik Conover, who has 1.48 million subscribers on the video platform, is now a Nest Seekers International broker.

New Jersey-born Conover, 30, went from living in a 300-square-foot New York City hovel to one of social media’s most recognizable real estate personalities.

An alum of Northeastern University, the former male model first rose to fame in 2014 as a travel and lifestyle vlogger on YouTube, but then focused his sights on luxury real estate.

His video tours go inside top-dollar trophy properties across the country, from a $56 million mansion in Bel Air to a $50 million spread in Malibu.

And as of this week, he officially has his real estate license and become Nest Seekers’ newest powerhouse agent.

His fiancée Hanna Coleman, 22, enjoys a strong presence on social media in her own right and is also joining Nest Seekers as its head of digital marketing and strategy.

Conover claims in a new video announcing his Nest Seekers gig that he’s the “most watched real estate agent in the world.”

One of his listings is a five-bedroom, six-bathroom home in Chelsea on the market for $26.5 million. He is marketing the property, located in the Porter House at 66 Ninth Ave., with Nest Seekers’ Jessica Campbell, who had it on the market for $29 million in 2018, as we previously reported.

Details in the Paris Forino-designed space include a 200-pound custom front door with rose mirror, steel and unlacquered brass. The full-floor unit has its own terrace.

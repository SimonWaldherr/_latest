They erased a pair of Braves leads and bedeviled them again with two-out magic, ultimately prevailing on Cody Bellinger&#8217;s <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/10/braves-dodgers-game-7-cody-bellinger-home-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">seventh-inning home run</a> to give them a 4-3 victory and their third NL pennant in four seasons.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They will advance to play the upstart Tampa Bay Rays in the World Series, Game 1 Tuesday night back here at this socially-distanced, pandemic-improvised neutral site.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They got there on the strength of heroes old and new.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Start with Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP whose playoff woes have dogged him since his record-breaking 2017 rookie season. He was just 4 for 22 in this NLCS when he stepped to the plate against Braves reliever Chris Martin, the score tied and two out in the seventh. Bellinger battled through eight pitches of the at-bat, before finally slamming a full-count pitch into the seats in right field, pausing by his dugout to exhort his Series-bound teammates.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Continue with Betts, acquired from the Boston Red Sox for pennies on the dollar and granted a $365 million contract. For the third consecutive game, Betts <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/10/18/mookie-betts-catch-dodgers-braves-nlcs-game-7/3707473001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">made a stunning defensive play in right field</a>, this time robbing Freddie Freeman of a fifth-inning homer that would have pushed the Braves&#8217; lead to 4-3.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And let&#8217;s not forget the players who date back to the first of these do-or-die games, the fifth game of the 2015 NLDS, who&#160; ould have been playing their last games as a Dodger. Kik&#233; Hernandez, inserted as a pinch hitter, led off the sixth with a game-tying home run off Braves reliever A.J. Minter.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Cody Bellinger celebrates his home run in the seventh inning."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">His old infield running mate, Justin Turner, kick-started perhaps the biggest game-turning play, the Braves with two runners in scoring position and already leading 3-2 when Nick Markakis hit a grounder to third.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Turner fielded it and with impeccable timing threw home to get Dansby Swanson in a rundown. This stroke of good fortune eventually <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/10/18/dodgers-braves-nlcs-game-7-double-play/3707259001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">resulted in a 5-2-5-6 double play.</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Let&#8217;s not forget manager Dave Roberts, panned for so many October misfires with his pitching moves. On this night, he masterfully guided five pitchers through the daunting Braves lineup, finished by Julio Ur&#237;as, who held down the Braves with three perfect innings of relief.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Braves? They are young and wildly talented and will be back. They just ran into a Dodgers team that crawled out of a 3-1 hole to retain the chance to prove they are, in fact, a notch better than their predecessors who came up short.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/mlb/2020/10/11/mlb-playoffs-photos-best-shots-conference-series/5963628002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

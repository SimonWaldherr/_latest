  Trump news live: Latest election updates as president begins attacks on debate moderator 
description: > 
  US president Donald Trump holds campaign rally in Nevada on SundayDonald Trump is once again getting his excuses in early as he begins complaining about NBC moderator Kristen Welker ahead of Thursday’s second and final debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden, having already whined about Chris Wallace and Savannah Guthrie."She’s always been terrible & unfair, just like most of the Fake News reporters, but I’ll still play the game," the president griped on Twitter.On Sunday, Trump attacked Biden for “listening to the scientists” on the coronavirus pandemic as he campaigned in Carson City, Nevada, claiming that an election victory for his opponent in 15 days’ time would lead to further lockdowns across the US.The president, who argued that his own actions since March had averted a “massive depression” despite millions of Americans losing their jobs and 220,000 dying of Covid-19, then claimed absurdly that Christmas would be cancelled under a Biden administration and blamed water management policies for people having to “flush their toilet 15 times”.

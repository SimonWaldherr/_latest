After undergoing blood, urine and saliva tests, Craig was prescribed a mixture of 20 vitamins and medications: "about 30 or 40 pills a day, some in the morning, some at night - something for my thyroid, hydrocortisone, DHEA, pregnenolone and a testosterone injection at the very start", at a cost of around £250 each month.

Craig says he felt a huge difference immediately after the testosterone shot: "increased libido, higher motivation and energy, and, over the coming weeks, less hair loss - which I had been noticing since I was a teenager in one particular area". In a little over a month, the knee pain he had been experiencing went away.

But for Craig, the biggest difference was losing 33lb over the next six months, an achievement he puts down to a renewed sense of motivation and drive. "Suddenly, I regained the impetus to lose weight and exercise. I started a wholefood/paleo diet. I had been very fit about five years previously, but let things slide when I focused on my career. At my two-month check-up, Dr Raichura changed the dose of melatonin, which was leaving me groggy for an hour or two in the morning after waking up. I now feel great. I can imagine continuing this for the rest of my life."

Before he retired this spring, having been in medical practice since 1978, consultant gynaecologist Yehudi Gordon helped popularise the prescription of bioidentical hormones in the UK for women ranging from their late teens through to after the menopause. "Dr Katharina Dalton was one of the pioneers of the bioidentical-hormone movement," says Dr Gordon. 'She started the very first premenstrual-tension clinic in the world in London in the 1940s, and advocated giving patients pure bioidentical progesterone via a vaginal pessary - these are still in use today in the infertility world.

"A woman in her late teens or early 20s may suffer from an imbalance between oestrogen and progesterone, which can be helped by prescribing a small amount of progesterone. Around the time of the menopause, the oestrogen levels from the ovaries drop and a woman starts needing more oestrogen. Later still in life, she may need more testosterone."

"Hormones are also responsible for maintaining collagen production, so they make the skin appear younger. Taking bioidentical hormones plumps up fine lines. And there is an oestriol cream that can be rubbed on to the exposed areas of the skin, which can help."

Perhaps unsurprisingly, a process this elaborate is costly. At The Lovely Clinic, which is in Chelsea, initial consultations start at £1,450-£2,050. Costs for prescriptions vary from just a few pounds to £500 a month for more complex and precision-personalised treatment plans, including custom-blended anti-ageing face creams or hair-regeneration tonics.

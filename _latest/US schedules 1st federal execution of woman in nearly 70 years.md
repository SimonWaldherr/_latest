She regained consciousness when Montgomery cut her open with a kitchen knife, which led to a struggle, authorities said.</p><p>Montgomery then strangled Stinnett again until she died and removed the baby, who she attempted to pass off as her own.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: This undated image provided by Attorneys for Lisa Montgomery shows Lisa Montgomery, who is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on Dec. 8, 2020, at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Ind." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>She later confessed to murdering Stinnett and abducting her child and was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri in October 2007 for federal kidnapping resulting in death.

Heady had killed the boy soon after the kidnapping but still received $600,000 from his parents after assuring them he was alive and would be returned within 24 hours.</p><p>The Justice Department also announced the scheduling for the execution for Brandon Bernard, who, along with accomplices in 1999, murdered two youth ministers, Todd and Stacie Bagley, on a military reservation in Fort Hood.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p>The couple was forced into the trunk of their car after agreeing to give a ride to several of Bernard's accomplices, who then drove the couple around for hours while attempting to steal their money and pawn Stacie Bagley's wedding ring, according to authorities.</p><p>Todd and Stacie Bagley spoke with their abductors about God and pleaded for their lives while locked in the trunk of their car.

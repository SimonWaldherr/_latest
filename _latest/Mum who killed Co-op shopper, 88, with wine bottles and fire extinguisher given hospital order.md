 <p>     </p> <p>Radcliffe also admitted the attempted murders of Andrew Price, 58, and nurses Gaynor Saurin, 65, and Lisa Way, 53, who survived after being attacked while shopping at the store during the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> lockdown.</p> <p>Mr Price heard her scream "You b*****d, I&#8217;ve got you now" as she grabbed him and stabbed him in the back of his neck outside the store.</p> <p>Mr Rees, a retired senior engineer whose heartbroken family described him as "the very definition of a good man", died of blunt force trauma at the scene, and suffered cuts to his hands as he tried to ward off the blows from the knife.</p> <p>He was a carer for his longtime wife Eunice, who was waiting for him in their Honda car outside the shop. The 87-year-old was found 15 minutes later by police.</p> <p>After the attacks on May 5, a friend said Mrs Rees, who has dementia, "has no idea what happened" and kept asking "Where's John?"</p>

 <p>Radcliffe, who had "delusional but specific intent to kill&#8221; brought about by her mental illness, appeared at Wednesday's sentencing hearing via videolink from Rampton high security psychiatric hospital near Woodbeck, Nottinghamshire, where she is currently detained.</p> <p>She was given a hospital order without a time limit as Judge Mrs Justice Jefford sentenced her at Merthyr Crown Court. To protect the public, Radcliffe cannot be discharged until a mental health tribunal deems her no longer a threat.</p> <p>New details about the attack emerged, with the judge being told Radcliffe took a kitchen knife from her home and walked to the Co-op store, where she stabbed her victims in the head and neck just before 2pm that day.</p> <p>Mr Price, the first person to be attacked, thought someone was messing around when he was grabbed by the neck, but he then heard a woman's voice saying: &#8220;You b*****d, I&#8217;ve got you now.&#8221;</p> <p>He fell to the floor as Radcliffe used a &#8220;stabbing motion as quick as she could&#8221;, and screamed "get off me", the court heard. He was stabbed twice but managed to run away.</p>

 <p>Witness Ms Saurin went into the shop, where she screamed for help and for someone to call the police.</p> <p>Radcliffe followed her in and asked her: &#8220;Do you want some of this?&#8221;</p> <p>The attacker then grabbed Ms Saurin and started swinging the knife, leaving her with stab wounds to her face and hands that needed stitches.</p> <p>Hero Mr Rees, who was hailed by the judge, intervened and tried to tackle Radcliffe, who knocked him to the floor.</p> <p>Mrs Way heard Radcliffe shout "I&#8217;m going to kill somebody" and was knifed in the neck.</p> <p>The defendant went back to Mr Rees, who kicked out at her and saved Ms Saurin's life, the court was told.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>He and another man had intervened in a desperate bid to protect her.</p> <p>&#8220;A selfless and brave act which cost him his life,&#8221;&#160;prosecutor Michael Jones QC told the court.</p> <p>He added: &#8220;Another customer, Lisa Way, attempted to talk to the defendant but she was attacked and injured by the knife.</p> <p>&#8220;The defendant focused on Mr Rees and repeatedly attacked him with a glass wine bottle and a fire extinguisher as he laid on the floor.&#8221;</p> <p>Mr Jones added: "The defendant unleashed what can only be described as a horrifically violent attack upon Mr Rees.</p>

 <p>"It was all captured on the store's CCTV and it continued until it was quite obvious he was dead."</p> <p>Describing the CCTV footage that was shown in court, Mr Jones said: &#8220;Mr Rees is on his back on the floor. First the defendant picks up a glass wine bottle and repeatedly hits him with it, once to the chest and three times deliberately and forcefully to the head and his face. The third time it broke.</p> <p>&#8220;She picked up another and hit him to the head and the face 21 times with a glass bottle. He is obviously injured and weakened by the attack. He is on the floor on his back and slowly becoming less conscious.</p> <p>&#8220;The defendant walks away briefly before walking back towards Mr Rees with a heavy fire extinguisher in her hand and she strikes him to the head three times with the base of it.</p> <p>&#8220;He was killed by the attack to the extent no attempts were made to revive him by paramedics. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>&#8220;Police officers arrived and were given a description by witnesses.</p>

 <p>&#8220;When approached by officers she put her hands in a praying motion. She was asked where she put the knife and she pointed out where it was.</p> <p>&#8220;On the shop floor there were various droplets of blood. The defendant said, &#8216;It had to be done and that&#8217;s it&#8217;.&#8221;</p> <p>CCTV footage showed Radcliffe walking away after hitting Mr Rees with the fire extinguisher, and then returning to his lifeless body three times to shout at him.</p> <p>Radcliffe, of Porth, was arrested inside the store by police, who rushed to the scene following multiple 999 calls and arrived within minutes.</p> <p>When she was quizzed by officers, she said she thought "someone was going to end up killing me" and "had voices in her head telling her to kill someone before she is killed".</p> <p>She said in a police interview: &#8220;I&#8217;m just sorry for my actions. Maybe I should have done things differently.&#8221;</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>A doctor's assessment found that before the attack Radcliffe had been hearing voices telling her that people were going to &#8220;slit her throat and kill her&#8221;.</p> <p>On the day of the killing &#8220;the voices had become more real", the court heard.</p> <p>Mr Jones said Radcliffe had &#8220;a delusional but specific intent to kill&#8221; brought about by her mental illness.</p> <p>Radcliffe&#8217;s barrister Jonathan Rees QC told the court that she was not taking medication prescribed to her at the time because she was worried about the side effects.</p> <p>He said: "She made genuine and sustained attempts to seek help before the tragic events took place,&#8221; he added.</p> <p>He added: &#8220;She feels real horror, shame, and great distress at the fact she caused such harm and suffering.</p>

 <p>&#8220;She is truly remorseful for the suffering she caused to the people she came across that day. She is trying to show that remorse not just through words but her actions also.</p> <p>&#8220;Her actions were diminished by her severe mental health. The harm caused was irreparable but the evidence is clear that Miss Radcliffe would not have committed these offences if she was not severely mentally ill at the time."</p> <p>The barrister said Radcliffe has had issues with anxiety and depression since 2009.</p> <p>Dr Phillip Huckle, answering questions from Radcliffe&#8217;s barrister, recommended a "very lengthy" hospital order to protect the public.</p> <p>The expert said: &#8220;When patients with schizophrenia kill it is usually members of their family and not members of the public and I think it is important that is heard.</p> <p>&#8220;This is of the nature and degree that warrants the detention of a hospital order. I would have no hesitation to say she requires a section 41, meaning the responsible clinician is not responsible for the discharge of the patient.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking at a very lengthy order and any discharge in future should be closely monitored.&#8221;</p> <p>Wednesday's hearing was told Radcliffe was given a conditional discharge after assaulting her sister in October 2013.</p> <p>She was jailed for battery for twice punching a nurse in the face and an on-duty police officer to the nose in July 2017.</p> <p>In a victim impact statement, Mr Rees' son-in-law Patrick Davidson Heuston said the pensioner "loved the Rhondda" and was "a respected member of the community".</p> <p>Mr Reeshad worked for the South Wales Electricity and was &#8220;calm, generous, and humble".</p> <p>The statement read: &#8220;We are very proud of the actions he took on the day but not surprised.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>&#8220;Eunice has lost her lifelong companion, her carer, and her home. This is all she ever knew and this has been taken.&#8221;</p> <p>A statement from longtime friend Wyndham Jones stated: "I would describe John as a true gem.</p> <p>&#8220;He was the kindest person you could ever wish to meet. He had time for everyone. He was patient and understanding.</p> <p>&#8220;He was so committed to working for his family and would go out of his way to help anyone. He was a proud gentleman and wouldn&#8217;t ask for help from anyone.</p> <p>&#8220;We both went to church and he rang the bell every Thursday for the NHS. John was loved by so many of his friends, family, and local community. I will miss him dearly.&#8221;</p> <p>Sentencing, Mrs Justice Jefford said the victims were "in the wrong place at the wrong time".</p> <p>She hailed Mr Rees for coming to the rescue of Ms Saurin, saying he suffered a "horrific and sustained attack of great violence".</p> <p>The judge added: &#8220;Mr Rees was a courageous man and his actions to the last saved the life of Gaynor Saurin."</p> <p>An inquest previously heard Mr Rees, who lived in the nearby village of Trealaw with his wife, died at the scene from severe blunt force trauma to the face including multiple facial fractures.</p> <p>In a statement after his death, his family said: "John was the very definition of a good man, extremely respected and liked in the community.</p> <p>"He was proud of his family, proud to be a Welshman and devoted to All Saints Church.</p> <p>"We will all miss him terribly."</p></div>

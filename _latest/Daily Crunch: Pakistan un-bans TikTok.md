<p><strong>The big story: Pakistan un-bans TikTok</strong></p>
<p>The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority blocked the video app 11 days ago, over what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/tiktok-pakistan-ban/">it described as &#8220;immoral,&#8221; &#8220;obscene&#8221; and &#8220;vulgar&#8221; videos</a>.

<p>&#8220;The restoration of TikTok is strictly subject to the condition that the platform will not be used for the spread of vulgarity/indecent content &amp; societal values will not be abused,&#8221; it continued.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time this year the country tried to crack down on digital content. Pakistan announced new internet censorship rules this year, but rescinded them after Facebook, Google and Twitter threatened to leave the country.</p>

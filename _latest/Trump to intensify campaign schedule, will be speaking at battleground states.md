President Trump on Saturday added a pair of critical battleground states to his itinerary next week, as his reelection campaign resumes in earnest less than two weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19.

Trump will headline a “Make America Great Again” rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Tuesday, and another the next day in Des Moines, Iowa, his campaign announced.

Trump won both states in 2016 — Pennsylvania by just 0.7 percent of the vote, Iowa by a commanding 9-percent margin. But polls in both states this month show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leading.

The Rust Belt rallies follow a Monday evening appearance in Florida that will mark Trump’s first campaign stop since his Oct. 2 COVID-19 diagnosis.

All three appearances will be held outdoors at regional airports to comply with state rules restricting large gatherings during the coronavirus outbreak.

<div><p>The next season of <i>Euphoria </i>will not be releasing until next year, but fans have something exciting to look forward to in the coming months. The show has confirmed that it will be airing two special episodes, one of which is set to release on Sunday, December 6.</p>

<p>The popular teen drama's next episode titled, &#8220;Trouble Don&#8217;t Last Always,&#8221; will pick up from where it left off, showing Zendaya stranded at the train station, relapsing. More details on the second special episode such as its name and release date are still to be revealed.</p>

<p>The actress took to her Twitter account to share the news with her followers, saying, &#8220;We really missed them. Two special &#8216;Euphoria episodes coming soon.&#8221; She was last seen wowing the world with her recent Emmys win.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been following Zendaya closely, she did drop a hint about these special episodes back in August in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel. &#8220;We're trying to figure out how to eventually be able to create a season 2 that we're all really proud of and get all the best out of it that we want but also still being very safe," she said. "So, we might end up doing a little bridge episode. I don't really know how to describe it, but an episode that we can do with a limited amount of people in a safer environment that can, I don't know, give people something," she added.</p>

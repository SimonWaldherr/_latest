  Federal Judge Strikes Down Trump Rule To Cut Food Benefits Amid Pandemic 
description: > 
  (Reuters) — A U.S. federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have cut food stamp benefits to almost 700,000 unemployed Americans amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, court documents showed.The pandemic has left millions of U.S. residents without jobs, sending thousands into lines at food banks.In 2019, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, provided stamps giving free food to about 36 million Americans.A coalition of attorneys general from several states, the city of New York and the District of Columbia challenged the USDA rule in January.Its rule would have limited each state’s ability to waive work mandates, effectively requiring more food stamp recipients to work.

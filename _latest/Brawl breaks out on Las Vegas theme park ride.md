</p><p>Video of the incident, which reportedly occurred at Halloween Town, shows a blonde woman shouting at a ride attendant who had asked her to get off.
</p><p>It is unclear what sparked the request for her to leave, but the altercation quickly got heated, with the attendant saying the woman was acting like a &#8220;damn animal&#8221;, and her responding that he &#8220;looks like an animal&#8221;.
</p><p></p><p id="article-im-prompt"></p><p>The woman, identified as &#8220;Christina&#8221; in the video, can be seen talking on the phone to someone, when she claims that she is getting kicked off the ride because she was &#8220;excited&#8221;.
</p><p></p><p>Other visitors can be heard trying to calm her down.
</p><p class="sc-puFxT ioRaEF"></p><p>&#8220;Christina, you need to relax, you need to have respect for people that are working,&#8221; another woman can be heard saying.
</p><p>The footage cuts to a point when all the visitors have left the ride, and a mass brawl breaks out, involving at least six people, including Christina.</p><p></p><p>Park employees can be seen trying to break up the fight, while ride goers are filmed pushing each other to the ground and hitting each other, and pulling one another&#8217;s hair. &#160;</p><p>Youtube user ImthatguyDoc posted the video on his account on 19 October, adding his own assessment of the incident at the end.
</p><p id="taboola-carousel-thumbnails"></p><p>&#8220;It was horrible &#8211; a lot of open-handed hits, a lot of chokeholds. It was just horrible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All because Christina couldn&#8217;t just get up and go.&#8221;
</p><p>He said the attendant was &#8220;overreacting&#8221;, but added that the best thing to do in that situation was &#8220;bow out&#8221;.
</p><p>&#8220;She wanted to sit there and talk reckless, and ended up getting dragged through the dirt,&#8221; he concluded.
</p><p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it had no record of the incident, reports <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/halloween-brawl-woman-ride"><i>Fox News</i></a>.</p><p></p><p>&#8220;There is a chance that it went unreported if no parties involved called for assistance and the property got those involved off property with security,&#8221; Officer Larry Hadfield said in a statement.

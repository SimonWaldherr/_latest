<ol><p class="slideData">13 of 13</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">Tony Gutierrez/Associated Press</p><p class=""><strong>21. Philadelphia 76ers (via Thunder):</strong> Tyrell Terry (Stanford, PG/SG, Freshman)</p><p class="">Terry comes off as a fit and potential target for the Sixers, who could use another ball-handler and off-ball scorer. He has some of the most convincing touch and range in the draft, important for a guard with limited size and athleticism.&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>22. Denver Nuggets (via Rockets:):</strong> Tyrese Maxey (Kentucky, SG, Freshman)</p><p class="">The Nuggets can use the draft to add to their depth, and Maxey would give them a combo guard who's willing to defend. Though his shooting numbers were disappointing at Kentucky, he should receive plenty of open looks in Denver, as well we a suitable role for his scoring ability.&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>23. Utah Jazz:</strong> Cole Anthony (North Carolina, PG, Freshman)</p><p class="">With Anthony potentially slipping outside the lottery, Utah could be a strong landing spot. He'd spend his rookie year learning under Mike Conley while still adding needed scoring and shot-making off the bench, particularly if the Jazz lose Jordan Clarkson in free agency.</p><p class=""><strong>24. Milwaukee Bucks (via Pacers):</strong> Aleksej Pokusevski (Olympiacos II, PF, 2001)</p><p class="">The Bucks could focus on acquiring win-now pieces through free agency and trades. They can use the draft to add a prospect with exciting long-term potential, and few offer more than Pokusevski, the 7-footer with fluid shooting skills, flashy passing and high shot-blocking rates.</p><p class=""><strong>25. Oklahoma City Thunder (via Nuggets):</strong> Zeke Nnaji (Arizona, PF/C, Freshman)</p><p class="">Nnaji's finishing, post skills and offensive rebounding motor seem likely to translate. But he figures to crack the first round by convincing a team he's a better shooter than what he was able to show at Arizona. He's currently working out in Las Vegas, and the tape we've seen looks encouraging.&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>TRADE at 26. New York Knicks (via Celtics):</strong> Leandro Bolmaro (Barcelona, SG/SF, 2000)</p><p class="">After acquiring a third first-round pick by moving down, the Knicks could try to package Nos. 26 and 27 to move up. Or they could use one of these late first-rounders to draft-and-stash Bolmaro, a 6'7" playmaker and defensive energizer. The Knicks could give him another season with Barcelona to work on his shooting before bringing him over.</p><p class=""><strong>27. New York Knicks (via Clippers):</strong> Jahmi'us Ramsey (Texas Tech, SG, Freshman)</p><p class="">The Knicks could go safer with an older guard at No. 27, or they could they could chase upside with Ramsey, an athletic scoring freshman who just needs to cut down on lapses at both ends. Regardless, it's easy to buy his shot-making carrying over based on his 42.6 three-point percentage and sweet-looking stroke.&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>28. Los Angeles Lakers:</strong> Payton Pritchard (Oregon, PG/SG, Senior)</p><p class="">There have been whispers about Pritchard going in the first round, and the Lakers would make sense as a team to show interest. He seems capable of contributing as a rookie with shooting, passing, IQ and toughness.&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>29. Toronto Raptors:</strong> Cassius Winston (Michigan State, PG, Senior)</p><p class="">Scouts have already talked about Winston in the steal conversation, given the likelihood of him going somewhere in the 20s or 30s. The Raptors could look past his age (22) and physical limitations for his shooting and playmaking skill, IQ and character.</p><p class=""><strong>30. Boston Celtics (via Bucks):</strong> Desmond Bane (TCU, SG, Senior)</p><p class="">A consistent shooter and improved playmaker throughout college, Bane has emerged as a potential first-rounder, with translatable strengths and intangibles that can attract both contenders and rebuilders.</p></ol>

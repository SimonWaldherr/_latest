<p>There are several red flags to identify debt collection scams. Authorized debt collectors are not allowed to threaten jail time or pose as a government official, <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0258-fake-and-abusive-debt-collectors">according to the FTC</a>. They're also not allowed to harass people with repeated phone calls. Debt collectors must verify the debt by providing information like the name of the original creditor and the total amount owed.</p>

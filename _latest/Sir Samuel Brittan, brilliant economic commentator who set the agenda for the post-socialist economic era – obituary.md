He was probably at his most influential during the first years of the Thatcher administration, but was by no means a “Thatcherite”. He was generally an admirer of the chancellorship of his former FT colleague and close friend Nigel Lawson from 1983; but if he happened to be in tune with the later Thatcher coterie on economic issues – including membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which he supported and promoted on economic grounds at the time – he was never a paid-up member, arriving at congruent answers by wholly independent processes of thought.

Social conservatism, by contrast, was alien to him: “What matters,” he wrote, “is freedom of action and speech among consenting adults.” Likewise the populist nationalism to which the prime minister herself became increasingly prone: Brittan was a dissenter against the Falklands War, on which his column written shortly after the sinking of the Belgrano and the Sheffield was headlined “Stop the killing straight away.”

Throughout his life, Brittan argued that the classification of all political views into “Left” and “Right” was a Bogus Dilemma: his 1968 book by that title was, in his own estimation, the best of his body of work. He objected to the US Republican Right for “giving competitive capitalism a bad name” by associating it with religious intolerance and chauvinistic foreign policy, and to the casual attachment of Right-wing labels to laissez-faire thinkers.

As for his own opinions, “I am not going to abate my opposition to the so-called independent nuclear weapon for fear of being thought on the Left any more than abate my support for markets for fear of being thought on the right.”

In recent times he criticised Liberal Democrats in the 2010-15 coalition for abandoning “Left libertarianism” in favour of “pavement politics, opportunist gestures and acting like a Labour colony in a Conservative administration”. As for the future of the European Union, he was liberally sceptical: “I am not urging the EU should end. Like the Holy Roman Empire, it may spend many years in gentle decline doing little good and little harm. Nor am I urging that the UK or any other member state should leave the EU. What I am saying is that the EU no longer deserves the devotion of practical idealists.”

And as for the quality of economic thinking displayed by the Chancellor of that era, George Osborne, Brittan remarked mischievously that “his record might be better than his pronouncements — one of those people who do the right things without knowing why.”

Samuel Brittan was born on December 29 1933, the son of Dr Joseph Brittan and his wife Rebecca, née Lipetz – Lithuanian Jews who had arrived in England as refugees in 1927 and settled in Cricklewood. His brother Leon, the future Conservative home secretary and EU commissioner, was born in 1939, and among their cousinage of Lithuanian descent was another future cabinet minister, Malcolm Rifkind.

Samuel was educated at Kilburn Grammar School, and went on to take a First in Economics at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1955. He contemplated a career as a psychologist, and also applied for a job with the Shell oil company.

Wednesday night, he took a far more assertive approach. According to a CBS News tally of the debate, Mr. Pence interrupted Ms. Harris twice as often as the reverse, though the two got nearly the same amount of speaking time.

The fact that Ms. Harris and Ms. Page are women only made his approach more noticeable — and more difficult to counteract. As the first woman of color on a presidential debate stage, Ms. Harris was acutely aware, as she and her team prepared for the debate, of avoiding an obstacle course of gendered and racial pitfalls.

“Part of why his performance last night was so striking is we haven’t seen Pence behave that way,” Ms. Finney said. “They are resorting to the classic tropes to try to attack her, diminish her and undermine her.”

Republicans reject the idea that Mr. Pence was leveling sexist attacks by interrupting Ms. Harris.

Kellyanne Conway, the former counselor to the president, who is close to Mr. Pence and used to work as his pollster, said Ms. Harris’s attempt to accuse the vice president of interrupting her seemed canned.

“These are the highest offices in the land,” she said. “You can’t absorb the accolades for making history as first woman of color on the ticket and then cry damsel in distress.”

Others made a similar observation. In a post-debate round table, the veteran broadcaster Martha Raddatz, who was a moderator at a 2016 presidential debate, expressed some frustration with the idea that the vice president had been “mansplaining” onstage. “A man can interrupt another vice-presidential candidate,” she said.

The vice president’s team and the Trump campaign both viewed the night as a success, arguing that the vice president’s challenge had been even greater than four years ago because this time he had to defend the president’s record of actions and statements, which Ms. Harris was prosecuting.

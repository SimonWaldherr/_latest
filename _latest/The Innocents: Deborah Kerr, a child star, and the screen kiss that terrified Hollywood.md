Shortly after the release of The Innocents in 1961, director Jack Clayton was eating in a Soho restaurant. Also there, dining at another table, was legendary French director François Truffaut. As Clayton ate, Truffaut sent over a waiter with a message scribbled on a napkin: “The Innocents is the best English film after Hitchcock goes to America.”

It’s safe to say that Truffaut, the maestro of French New Wave Cinema, knew his stuff. In contrast to the Technicolor blood-splattered Hammer films of the era, or gimmicky haunted house pictures (“Cinematic equivalents of a ride on the ghost train at the funfair,” wrote Innocents expert Sir Christopher Frayling), Jack Clayton’s black-and-white ghost story – based on Henry James's The Turn of the Screw – is a masterpiece of spiraling, psychological terror.

The Turn of the Screw is about to haunt the screen again. This time in the Netflix series The Haunting of Bly Manor, the second installment of Mike Flanagan’s The Haunting of… anthology series. But The Innocents has left considerable ghostly footsteps in which to follow. It's not just the finest adaptation of the world’s most famous ghost story, but an evolution of it. By way of the stage play and opera versions – from which Jack Clayton picked up pieces along the way – The Innocents goes deeper into the chills and (alleged) perverse subtext of The Turn of the Screw.

The Innocents stays relatively close to James's 1898 novella: Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) takes a job as the governess at the Bly country estate, where she will care for two young children – a brother and sister named Miles (Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin) – who are all-but abandoned by their bachelor uncle (Michael Redgrave). Unnerved by the children’s sometimes-spooky behaviour and sightings of strange figures (who no else seems to see… or do they?) Miss Giddens believes the ghosts of illicit lovers – who both worked and died on the Bly estate – have returned to possess the children. But are the ghosts real? Or do they exist only in the governess’s mind?

Martin Stephens was just 11 years old when he played Miles. Almost 60 years later, he enjoys the shadow of uncertainty that looms over the film. “I like the fact it’s ambiguous,” he tells me. “That, to me, is what makes it unsettling. It leaves you teetering on this razor blade of indecision. Did she imagine those ghosts? Or were they real?”

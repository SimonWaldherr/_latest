More than 800 people are hospitalized with COVID-19, a number that is 20% higher than just a week ago. </p><p>Officials report more than 35,620 cases of the virus in Wales and more than 1,700 people have died. </p><p>The rate of infection is currently 1.4, and the seven-day rolling incidence rate for Wales stands at more than 120 cases per 100,000 population, <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-circuit-break-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">according to the government</a>. </p><p>"The aim of a fire break is to reset the clock," Drakeford said. </p><p>Non essential travel within Wales and into and out of Wales will not be allowed during the two-week fire break. Additionally, people are not permitted to visit other households or meet with people they do not live with.

  “You know, I wake up every day and thank God that I did.I go to bed every night praying I’m gonna wake up.I don’t know how many of you do that, those of you who are not sick, those of you who are not facing something like I and countless other millions are.But it’s a blessing when you wake up.It’s a stop-everything-and-thank-God moment.”

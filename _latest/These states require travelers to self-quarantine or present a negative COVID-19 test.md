As states have opened back up, some are now tightening restrictions, and travelers may not be free to come and go as they please amid the coronavirus pandemic.

USA TODAY has an update on the states that are discouraging interstate travel by requiring or recommending that visitors and residents returning from other states quarantine. And some states are requiring a recent, negative COVID-19 test in lieu of a blanket quarantine policy.

Some counties or municipalities have issued similar advice to travelers, so anyone looking to go on a road trip or take a summer vacation should check government websites for their destination and anywhere they plan to stop overnight.

Here are the states that require or recommend traveler quarantines:

Alaska

Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced that beginning August 11, non-Alaska residents need a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before arrival in the state or proof they are waiting on results from a test taken in that 72-hour period. Non-residents without a pre-test can get one on arrival, though for a price.

"If a non-resident arrives without a pre-test, testing is available for $250 per test," according to a policy on the state's website. "The traveler will be required to quarantine while waiting on results."

Testing is free for Alaska residents.

The previous policy, below, will stay in effect through August 10.

Dunleavy and the state's Department of Health and Social Services lifted the state's mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers. Both interstate and international travelers can come to Alaska as long as they meet the following requirements:

If tested within 72 hours to five days before they leave their destination, they can come into Alaska with proof of a negative PCR coronavirus test. They can't enter if the test is positive.

Alternately, if they had a negative PCR test within five days of departure, they can retest upon arrival in Alaska. They should minimize contact until the results of the second test come in.

If the traveler is a member of the critical infrastructure workforce, as determined by the state, they have to adhere to their company's community protective plan the state has on file.

If none of the above applies (the traveler doesn't have a test result, rejects testing, or is not a critical worker), that person must quarantine for 14 days.

Arkansas

While the state no longer mandates a 14-day quarantine for visitors, it still asks that Arkansans consider doing so when returning from travel to affected areas.

Connecticut

Effective June 25, the state will require a 14-day quarantine for any visitor or resident returning from a region with a transmission rate of 10 positive tests for every 100,000 residents on a seven-day rolling average.

District of Columbia

Washington, D.C. will require travelers coming to the city to self-quarantine for 14 days if they are arriving from a high-risk area on nonessential travel.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said July 24 that the self-quarantine requirement would take effect the following week. Maryland and Virginia, which border D.C., are exempt from the order, but other states that see a seven-day moving average of new COVID-19 cases at 10 or more per 100,000 people will be affected.

As of Sept. 21, the updated list of "high-risk states" that require a 14-day self-quarantine include: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin .

Florida

Effective Aug. 6, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis rescinded the state's14-day quarantine rule for visitors from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

Hawaii

With the number of COVID-19 cases growing in the Aloha State, Hawaii Gov. David Ige said on Aug. 6 that he would reinstate the 14-day quarantine requirement for people traveling between the islands beginning Aug. 11, while making an exception for people arriving on Oahu from the other counties.

“I have been working closely with all of our county mayors and we agree that reinstating the inter-island travel quarantine is necessary and the right thing to do at this time. We must protect our neighbor island residents in light of the alarming increase in COVID-19 cases on O‘ahu,” Ige said.

Hawaii, which has been aggressive in enforcing its quarantine rules, originally lifted the inter-island quarantine rule on June 16.

On July 13, Gov. David Ige announced he was delaying the start of a program that would allow out-of-state visitors with a negative COVID-19 test to bypass quarantine by at least one month to Sept. 1.

Kentucky

Under a new advisory announced Monday, Kentuckians who travel to nine hot spot states reporting positive testing rates equal or greater than 15% are now recommended to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine. The states included in Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s travel advisory are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas and Mississippi.

Beshear said case clusters have been traced to residents who have recently returned from vacations or attended large gatherings such as block parties or barbecues.

Maine

Unless a visitor has a negative PCR COVID-19 test result from within 72 hours of travel, all but those from the following states must self-quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their state of residency: Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Vermont and Massachusetts. Visitors under quarantine are not allowed to go to grocery stores and therefore must bring enough food to last the duration of their quarantine or arrange to have food brought to them.

Maryland

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on July 29 issued a travel advisory urging residents to avoid visiting some states with rapidly increasing cases of coronavirus.

The travel advisory applies to states with positive test rates of or higher than 10%. As of July 29, that would include Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas.

Hogan said if people must visit those states, they should immediately be tested upon returning to Maryland and quarantine themselves until learning the results.

Massachusetts

As of Aug. 1, everyone coming into Massachusetts (except those coming from lower-risk states) must quarantine for 14 days or show a negative COVID-19 test result administered up to 72 hours in advance of their arrival. If the test results haven't come in before travelers get to Massachusetts, they quarantine until the results are in.

Anyone entering the state has to fill out a travel form before entering, also as of Aug. 1. However, those traveling from lower-risk states or who meet other exemptions won't have to do so. Details here.

People who don't follow the rules could be subject to a $500 fine per day.

Nebraska

Nebraskans returning from international travel and visitors coming to the state for less than 14 days should self-quarantine for the duration of their visit.

New Jersey

Travelers flying into New Jersey from so-called hot spot states where coronavirus is spiking will be asked to fill out a survey starting July 20.

The announcement came from state health Commissioner Judith Persichilli more than three weeks after Gov. Phil Murphy joined his counterparts in New York and Connecticut to announce a mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors arriving from states with high numbers of positive cases.

New Mexico

Unless a visitor presents a negative COVID-19 test result from within 72 hours before travel or after arriving, anyone from this list of high-risk states (defined as those with a 5% positivity rate or greater over a 7-day rolling average, or a positive test rate greater than 80 per 1 million residents) is required to quarantine for 14 days or the duration of their visit, no matter whether they arrive by plane, car or public transportation. Travelers from lower-risk states are advised to self-quarantine and get tested within a week of arrival. While in New Mexico, all visitors must also comply with the state's mask and social-distancing orders.

New York

Gov. Andrew Cuomo's state, which was the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic early on, is also requiring visitors and residents returning from from out of state to quarantine for 14 days. Check the list.

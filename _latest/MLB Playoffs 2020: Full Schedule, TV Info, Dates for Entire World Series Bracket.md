Major League Baseball's 60-game shortened season is over. The seedings are set. It's time for baseball's first-ever 16-team postseason.

The playoffs could be wide-open this year. The American League may come down to whether the New York Yankees hit a hot streak or a cold streak during these playoffs.

When the Yankees have been hot this season, they've looked like the best team in baseball, with winning streaks of six, seven and 10 games at various points this year. They have the bats to scare anyone. But their lows have also been very low, at one point losing 15 out of 20 games in the middle of the year. And they enter the postseason having lost six of their last eight games. Good luck figuring out the Yanks.

New York started the playoffs on a hot streak by scoring 22 runs a two-game sweep of Cleveland in the American League Wild Card Series.

The Yanks' divisional rivals, the Tampa Bay Rays, have been the epitome of consistency, meanwhile, and deserve their place atop the American League. An excellent bullpen, a balanced offense and a quality rotation led by Blake Snell will make them a tough out. The Toronto Blue Jays found that out the hard way after the Rays swept them in their AL Wild Card Series.

The National League is all about the Los Angeles Dodgers. Every year they are contenders. And every year they come up short. Is this the year they finally end their 32-year title drought?

They are out of excuses. They have the best record in baseball and the best roster in baseball. It isn't World Series or bust for the Dodgers with their core players under club control next season. But this is their NL pennant to lose, even with other dangerous teams like the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres.

Los Angeles is off to a good start on its World Series quest after sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Wild Card Series.

Let's take a look at the full postseason matchups and schedule.

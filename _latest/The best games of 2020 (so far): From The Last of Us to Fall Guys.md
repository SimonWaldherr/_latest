<div><p>The digital escapism of video games has become ever more important in 2020, as&#160;people search for entertainment, distraction and challenge in their&#160;vastly altered reality.</p>
<p>Even as we look forward to new games consoles in the form of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/xbox-series-x-games-showcase-surprises-fewer-release-dates-strong/">Xbox Series X</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/ps5-launch-plenty-promise-questions-still-hang-sonys-new-console/">PS5</a>, developers have not let us down in providing us with thrills, spills and relaxation. The best games of 2020 span military action, post-apocalyptic drama, chilled out town management and even giant jelly beans grappling in a flamboyant game-show.&#160;</p>
<p>Here are our favourites of the year so far. If there are any we may have missed, let us know in the comments below and we will be sure to lose ourselves in another new world.</p>
<h3>Hades (PC, Switch)</h3>
<p>Despite being in early access since 2018, Supergiant&#8217;s superb <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/hades-review-devilishly-good-time/">Hades</a> reached its full hellish vision this year. A dungeon-crawling &#8216;rogue-like&#8217; adventure that has you -as Zagreus, the son of the God of the Dead- trying to escape hell by fighting your way from Tartarus to the River Styx. Combat is supremely crisp, dashing between enemies with your weapon of choice from that particular escape attempt. The god of Olympus send blessings to buff you on your quest, before death sends you back to the House of Hades and tasks you with starting again. Maybe try a different weapon and build Zag&#8217;s skills in a different way. Its gameplay loop is brilliantly compulsive, while its art and characterisation build a rich underworld which is difficult to escape in more ways than one.</p>

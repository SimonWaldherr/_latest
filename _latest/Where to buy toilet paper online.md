The only problem &#8212; and it's a big one &#8212; is that many popular online stores are also completely out of stock or offering overpriced products from third-party sellers.&#160;</p><p>We advise against <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-amazon-target-selling-out-of-toilet-paper-online-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stockpiling toilet paper</a> beyond reason so everyone can get fair access to the supplies they need; see <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-water-toilet-paper-stockpile-not-necessary-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why two experts say that's more harmful than helpful here</a>. To protect yourself effectively against the coronavirus, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends</a> washing your hands often for at least 20 seconds each time, avoiding close contact with people who are sick or if you yourself are sick, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily.&#160;</p><p>We also caution against buying products at marked-up prices if you can avoid it. The increased prices are a result of hoarding and product shortages. Manufacturers have said <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/purell-hand-sanitizer-sells-out-amazon-coronavirus-fears-2020-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they'll work to address production shortages</a>, so we expect to see more availability and normal prices.</p><p>That said, in our frequent searches these past few months, there have been a few online retailers offering quality toilet paper. In our search, we looked at Amazon, Target, Boxed, FreshDirect, Walmart, Grove Collaborative, and Home Depot, among other retailers. It's unlikely you'll find your favorite brand at the usual suspects consistently (Amazon, Target), but other retailers you might not immediately think of (Rite Aid, Staples) may still have toilet paper in stock.</p><p>Prices and links are accurate as of publishing time and we'll do our best to keep this list updated with affordable in-stock purchase options.&#160;</p><h2>Here's where you can buy toilet paper online:&#160;</h2><p>Note: As of 10/15/20, the following options are in stock online or available in stores, though availability depends on your zip code so inventory can change.

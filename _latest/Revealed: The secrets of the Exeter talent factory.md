Chairman Tony Rowe, the overseer of the club’s rise to such prominence, still harbours ambitions to see a fully home-grown XV run out at Sandy Park. Victory on Saturday, only 10 years after the Chiefs were promoted from the Championship, would be a landmark moment, a reward for graft, shrewdness and husbandry.

“We are massively proud of where we come from,” said fly-half and captain, Joe Simmonds, whose dad, David, and uncle, Rob, are former playing stalwarts of Teignmouth RFC. “We speak about it all the time as a team. Of course, there are guys from elsewhere in the team like Stuart Hogg [Scotland] or Dave Dennis [Australia] but it matters to use who we represent. That sense of identity is a real driver for us.”

As it is for the city. The chief executive of Exeter City Council, Karime Hassan, was Chief Planner when the application for the club to relocate from its city-centre County Ground to a new-build at Sandy Park was first put in around the turn of the century.

“Tony Rowe was ambitious back then, wanting a stadium big enough to host European Cup semi-finals,” said Hassan. “Nothing captures the aspirations we have as a city better than the achievements of the Chiefs. We are the second fastest growing city in England in that 20-year period. The Met Office has moved here, the university has become part of the Russell Group but it is the Chiefs that best encapsulates what we strive to be and has helped put us on the map. And their values are the values we also want to espouse: diligent, progressive and high-achieving.”

None of this has come about through chance. Rob Baxter could have been scripted in central casting so clearly does he represent what Exeter Chiefs are about. A Devonian by blood, he still lives with his extended family on the 300-acre farmstead on the outskirts of the city. The clan includes dad, John, a one-time England triallist and former captain as well as Chiefs committee man. Rob was a long-term Exeter player himself alongside brother, Richie, who turned out a record 431 times for the club. The Baxter DNA is the Exeter DNA, a breed without ego.

“We do take pride in what we are and what we feel we are about and, yes, that does have a connection with the city and the area itself,” said Baxter. “It was a conscious decision to recruit locally. Saracens used to have better links with one of the feeders, Ivybridge college, than we did. We had to make Exeter attractive for players.

"It never used to be the case as the likes of Phil Vickery or Graham Dawe or Stuart Hooper and many, many others, would by-pass us to play rugby higher up the leagues. Promotion was obviously key. Of course you do need a balance in how you recruit but our home-grown talent represents more than just a player to us. It is about who we are.

"We have an intake of about 15 into our academy every year and they will take part in every training session and be in every meeting. I overheard a Zoom conversation one of our coaches was having the other evening with one of the lads on our books who is still at boarding school. Every answer he gave to the coach could have come from one of our senior players.

"So, there is an Exeter way of doing things. It’s a virtuous circle: the better you become the more people want to be part of it. Good players head down this way to do degree courses in the hope that they might be signed. And we now recruit more from Exeter University than we do from overseas.”

That umbilical cord will not be easily broken even if all the junior clubs are feeling the pinch due to Covid. Teignmouth is a typical example of a club happy to nurture young talent with a view to it moving onwards and upwards. Sam Simmonds played junior rugby there while Joe had 18 months in the senior XV as a 17-year-old, helping the club win the league as well as the Devon Cup, before signing a contract with the Chiefs. Another Teignmouth product, Max Norrie, is also on Exeter’s books.

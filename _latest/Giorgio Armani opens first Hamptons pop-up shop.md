Giorgio Armani opened its first pop-up boutique in East Hampton this weekend.

The 1,800-square-foot space, at 54 Newtown Lane, will be open seven days a week between now and October. While the brand will adhere to all CDC guidelines in-store, shoppers can also book private or virtual appointments.

Designed with a jungle theme, the storefront is adorned with a vibrant palm tree decor. The new space is selling a range of categories, including women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, fragrances, accessories, fine jewelry and giftable items from Armani/Casa.

The highlight is a special presentation of the brand’s La Prima Collection of handbags that have been on an international tour with stops in Italy, Germany and France.

The collection is a reference to the original handbag first designed and sold by Armani in 1995. The silhouette and clean lines echo chic ’90s minimalism and is a timely nod to fashion’s obsession with the iconic era.

All items are available at Giorgio Armani East Hampton, 54 Newtown Lane or at armani.com

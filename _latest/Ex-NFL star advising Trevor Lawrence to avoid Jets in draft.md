<div><p>If the Jets end up with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, can&#8217;t-miss college quarterback Trevor Lawrence should return to Clemson for his senior season so to avoid New York at all costs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what four-time Pro Bowler and former Falcons star wide receiver Roddy White is advising Lawrence, the gifted pocket passer considered to be one of the most talented quarterback prospects of all time and best since Andrew Luck in 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it would be awful for you to get drafted by the Jets because they do not know how to put anything together over there as far as quarterbacking, weapons around the quarterback, as far as anything that has to do with offensive talent,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/roddy-white-trevor-lawrence-return-to-clemson-if-jets-get-no-1-pick-01en3ejp27g4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White told The Big Lead</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There is a good chance the Jets become the third team in NFL history to finish 0-16, behind the 2008 Lions and 2017 Browns, which would guarantee them the top pick in the draft as every other team has won at least one game this season.</p>
<p>Lawrence, 21, may be too difficult to pass up, even though it has been only three years since the Jets selected Sam Darnold with the third-overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.</p>
 
<p>The 23-year-old Darnold has mostly failed to live up to expectations, in large part due to mediocre talent around him, as White pointed out, and having played under two coaches in such a short time frame.</p>
<p>Through six games this season the Jets have tallied a league-low 75 points on offense (25 fewer the team right above them), and it is widely expected second-year head coach and play-caller Adam Gase will be fired by the end of the season.</p>
<p>But it would be shocking if Lawrence, the 6-foot-6 signal caller with long blond hair, didn&#8217;t declare for the draft, having already won a national title with Clemson in 2019. He has spent his junior season toying with defenses, like Saturday when he threw a career-high five touchdowns in the first half of a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/trevor-lawrence-is-going-off-as-jets-2020-nfl-draft-noise-grows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">73-7 win Saturday over Georgia Tech</a>, bringing his season-total to 15 in five games.</p>
<p>If Lawrence were to follow the advice of White, it would conjure up painful memories for Jets fans.</p>
<p>After finishing 1-15 in 1996, the Jets were primed to select Peyton Manning with the No. 1 pick and team him up with the newly hired Bill Parcells and previous top pick and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.</p>
<p>Then the future Hall of Famer Manning <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/the-potential-trevor-lawrence-heartbreak-looming-over-jets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stunningly announced he would return to Tennessee</a> for his senior season, creating one of the biggest what-ifs in Jets history.</p>

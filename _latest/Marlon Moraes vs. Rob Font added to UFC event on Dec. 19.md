<p id="vji97K">Multiple people with knowledge of the promotion&#8217;s plans confirmed to MMA Fighting that Moraes will face <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2918/rob-font">Rob Font</a> at the UFC&#8217;s Dec. 19 event. The fight card is scheduled to take place at the UFC APEX in Las Vegas.</p>
<p id="XbsKGH">Reporter Mike Russell first <a href="https://twitter.com/MIKERUSSELLMMA/status/1318624655826178048?s=20">tweeted</a> the targeted booking. </p>
<p id="YkpLMf">After a four-fight winning streak led him to a title shot, Moraes has lost two of three, including a third-round TKO at the hands of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2186/henry-cejudo">Henry Cejudo</a> in the 135-pound championship main event at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1030/ufc-238">UFC 238</a>. &#8220;Magic&#8221; bounced back with a split decision win over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/7/jose-aldo">Jose Aldo</a> at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1056/ufc-245">UFC 245</a> this past December before headlining <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1163/ufc-fight-island-5-moraes-vs-sandhagen">UFC Fight Island 5</a> earlier this month and was subsequently finished in the second round by <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4356/cory-sandhagen">Cory Sandhagen</a>.</p>
<p id="JK5SyN">Font will make the walk to the octagon for the first time in over a year as he looks to build on a two-fight winning streak. The Massachusetts native picked up back-to-back decision wins over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1616/sergio-pettis">Sergio Pettis</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4420/ricky-simon">Ricky Simon</a>. Font recently told MMA Fighting that he tore his ACL in the second round of his win over Simon this past December and that he was looking to get a fight in before the end of the year. </p>
<p id="rqX6Eh">The UFC&#8217;s Dec. 19 fight card is currently without a main event, though <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a> is targeting breakout star <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5368/khamzat-chimaev">Khamzat Chimaev</a> as one of the headliners. </p>

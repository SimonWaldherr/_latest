  CVS and other stores want to help you safely trick-or-treat 
description: > 
  New York (CNN Business) Add trick-or-treating to the list of social activities upended by the pandemic this year.Given the highly infectious nature of Covid-19, it's not the safest idea to go door-to-door with the kids to collect Halloween treats.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued Halloween safety guidelines last month in which the agency deemed traditional trick-or-treating a "high risk activity."But what if the treats show up on your doorstep instead, in something called a "boo bag?"Boo Bags are a Halloween trend that have gained some traction in suburban neighborhoods in recent years.

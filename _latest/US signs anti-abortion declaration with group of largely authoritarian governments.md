<div><p>Move is part of a campaign by Trump administration to reorient US foreign policy in a more socially conservative direction</p><p>The US has today signed an anti-abortion declaration with a group of about 30 largely illiberal or authoritarian governments, after the failure of an effort to expand the conservative coalition.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Geneva Consensus Declaration&#8221; calls on states to promote women&#8217;s rights and health &#8211; but without access to abortion &#8211; and is part of a campaign by Trump administration, led by secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pompeo" class="u-underline">Mike Pompeo</a>, to reorient US foreign policy in a more socially conservative direction, even at the expense of alienating traditional western allies.</p>

<a class="rich-link__link u-faux-block-link__overlay" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/17/mike-pompeo-human-rights-women-lgbt-unalienable"></a>

<p>The &#8220;core supporters&#8221; of the declaration are Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia and Uganda, and the 27 other signatories include Belarus (where security forces are currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/13/belarus-police-will-fire-on-protesters-if-necessary-says-deputy-interior-minister" class="u-underline">trying to suppress</a> a women-led protest movement), Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Sudan, South Sudan, Libya.</p>
<p>Most of the signatories are among the 20 worst countries to be a woman according to the <a href="https://giwps.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/WPS-Index-2019-20-Report.pdf" class="u-underline">Women, Peace and Security Index</a> established by Georgetown University.</p>
<p>None of the top twenty countries on that list, with the exception of the US (ranked 19th) has signed the declaration.</p>
<p>The only other European signatory (apart from Belarus and Hungary) is Poland, where the constitutional court approved a near total ban on abortion on Thursday.</p>
<p>The list of Geneva Consensus supporters has grown little over the past year, despite a campaign by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" class="u-underline">Trump administration</a> to find new recruits.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2019, around 25 countries signed one or more joint statements regarding these issues of mutual concern,&#8221; a US memorandum circulated among supportive governments said earlier this year. &#8220;We would like many more countries to join this Declaration in 2020 so that our mutual priorities in the multilateral space can succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gillian Kane, senior policy adviser <a href="https://www.ipas.org/" class="u-underline">for Ipas</a>, an international organisation advocating safe access to abortion, said: &#8220;The United States has failed at consensus and coalition building. There are 193 UN member states and they&#8217;ve got 31. This is a terrible showing. None of our like-minded partners are there, and none of the people on the list could care less about women. It&#8217;s a failure of diplomacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A virtual signature ceremony was co-hosted by Pompeo and US health and human services secretary, Alex Azar. They portrayed the declaration as a historic moment in a movement to stop abortion being supported as part of reproductive health care, and credited Donald Trump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under President Trump&#8217;s leadership, the United States has defended the dignity of human life everywhere and always,&#8221; Pompeo said. &#8220;He has done it like no other president in history. We have mounted an unprecedented defense of the unborn abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the declaration, the signatories: &#8220;Reaffirm that there is no international right to abortion, nor any international obligation on the part of states to finance or facilitate abortion&#8221;.</p>
<p>The declaration uses &#8220;pro-family&#8221; language, supporting the &#8220;role of the family as foundational to society and as a source of health, support, and care&#8221; - which has been associated in the past with opposition to gay marriage and LGBT rights.</p>

<p>The document signed on Thursday also emphasises the primacy of national sovereignty in determining policy and rights, a theme pursued in another project heavily promoted by Pompeo at the state department, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/16/pompeo-claims-private-property-and-religious-freedom-are-foremost-human-rights" class="u-underline">commission on unalienable rights,</a> which argues that the US view on human rights should be rooted in its own constitutional history.</p>
<p>As with the unalienable rights commission, career officials at the state department were largely excluded from the development of the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which has been carried out by political appointees.</p>

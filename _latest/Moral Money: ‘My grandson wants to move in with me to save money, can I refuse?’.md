<div><p>I&#8217;m 76 and have lived very happily by myself for almost 10 years. But now my daughter is pressuring&#160;me into letting my grandson move into my spare room.&#160; </p>
<p>He wants to save some money and doesn&#8217;t see the point of paying hundreds of pounds a month to live in London when he can&#8217;t even go to the pub with his friends.&#160;He has asked to move back in with his parents, however they have recently downsized and don&#8217;t have much room.&#160;</p>
<p>Now every time my daughter phones she hints about all the unused space I have and my spare bedroom.&#160;I do understand that things <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/no-job-no-home-no-savings-young-people-may-never-recover-coronavirus/">are tough for young people</a> and I love my grandson dearly, but I am very fond of my routine.&#160;I do my own online shopping, have friends over for bridge and watch whatever I like on the television. </p>
<p>Do I really want him sitting at&#160;the kitchen table all day while he works from home, taking office calls as I try to listen to the radio, and playing his music loudly in the evenings?&#160; If I wanted company, I could get a lodger and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy-to-let/revealed-londons-new-buy-to-let-hotspots/">earn hundreds of pounds a month</a> &#8211; whereas I expect my grandson will be wanting his bed and board for free.&#160;</p>

<p>It seems a bit&#160;unfair to assume your grandson has no intention of paying his way without even asking him. He may be very keen to help out with bills and shopping.&#160;After all, even if he paid you &#163;100 a month or so and chipped in for bills, he&#8217;d still be saving much more than if he stayed in London.&#160;</p>
<p>But it seems, for you, the rent (or lack of) is not really the problem: it is your independence. Some readers would call you miserly for not wanting to help out your own flesh and blood, particularly when young people have been hit so hard by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Many young workers are<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/renting/millennials-spend-third-salary-rent-nine-ways-cut-cost/"> having to spend half their salary</a> or more on rent and are giving up hope of ever owning their own home. If they were to lose their job, as could well happen as the pandemic drags on, they could find themselves in a very precarious position.&#160;</p>
<p>Moreover, part of the reason why young people struggle to buy a home is because there are so many retirees living in houses that are&#160;too large for them.&#160;</p>
<p>Your grandson is very sensible to be trying to save money and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/jobs-crisis-workers-need-least-11000-savings-case-unemployment/">build up an emergency fund</a>.&#160;Helping him to do that would come at very little cost to you, especially considering the unused space you have in your home.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Others would disagree. You have probably worked hard your whole life and sacrificed a great deal for the sake of family. Why should you not enjoy a little independence and your own space now that your children are grown up?&#160; Some would point out that&#160;his own parents should be doing more to help him out.&#160;</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a compromise to be reached if you set down some ground rules.&#160;You could let him stay on the proviso that he respects your space, avoids being noisy after certain hours and doesn&#8217;t try to monopolise the television. That seems a small price to pay in exchange for free or cheap accommodation. You&#8217;ll be fulfilling your grandmotherly duties without having to sacrifice your lifestyle.&#160;</p>

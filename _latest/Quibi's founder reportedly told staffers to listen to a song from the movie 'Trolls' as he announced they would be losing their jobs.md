<p>Quibi's goal was to create short-form shows that were specially formatted for smartphones and could be watched on the go. The streaming service raised $1.75 billion from investors like Walmart, PepsiCo, and Anheuser-Busch ahead of its launch in April, but failed to attract viewers. The company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quibi-streaming-service-considering-shutting-down-report-2020-10">announced Wednesday that it's shutting down</a> just six months after launch.&#160;</p><p>In <a href="https://quibi-hq.medium.com/an-open-letter-from-quibi-8af6b415377f">an open letter</a> to investors, employees, and supporters, Katzenberg and Quibi CEO Meg Whitman acknowledged the challenges Quibi has faced, saying the company isn't succeeding because of the coronavirus pandemic and because "the idea itself wasn't strong enough to justify a standalone streaming service."</p><p>"We have reluctantly come to the difficult decision to wind down the business, return cash to our shareholders, and say goodbye to our colleagues with grace," Katzenberg and Whitman wrote. "We want you to know we did not give up on this idea without a fight."</p><p>Katzenberg told investors on Wednesday that Quibi will return $350 million in capital to its investors rather than try to keep the company afloat, the Journal reported. In the letter, Katzenberg and Whitman wrote that in the coming months, they'll look to find buyers for Quibi's original content and its underlying technology platform.</p>

Model Katrin Thormann and her husband, Compass broker Nick Gavin, are listing their Manhattan duplex for $2.69 million.

Gavin and Thormann paid $2.57 million for the loft-like apartment, which has two bedrooms and 2½ bathrooms, in 2016. The 1,601-square-foot fifth- and sixth-floor loft comes with a home office and a modest $1,467-a-month maintenance fee.

Striking original details from the 1915 building include timber beams, columns, exposed brick and oak floors.

We hear the couple, who have a toddler, are in contract to buy a four-bedroom unit in the same building, located at 134-136 Baxter St. at the intersection of Little Italy and Chinatown. That purchase is an off-market deal.

Originally used as a stable for the nearby police headquarters, by 1927 the Baxter Street structure had morphed into a manufacturing warehouse. The words Grand Machinery Exchange, still visible on the facade, date to that period — and it’s what developers, who converted the six-story space into 14 condos in 2007, named the building.

Neighbors include actor Norman Reedus of “The Walking Dead,” who owns a penthouse in the building. The listing brokers are Gavin himself and Josh Doyle, of Compass.

A native of Germany, Thormann, 33, who has graced the covers of Italian Vogue as well as other magazines, runways and campaigns, posted a photo of the loft on Instagram the day they closed on it in 2016, just a few months before their daughter, Greta, was born.

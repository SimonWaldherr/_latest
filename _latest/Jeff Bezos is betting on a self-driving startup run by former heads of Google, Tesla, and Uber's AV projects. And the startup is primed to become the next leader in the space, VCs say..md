When Business Insider asked seven venture capitalists to choose the two self-driving startups they believe have the most potential, the majority named Aurora Innovation.

After years of consolidation, many of the autonomous-vehicle industry's most highly regarded companies are either divisions of large firms or closely tied to one: Cruise with GM, Argo with Ford and VW, Zoox with Amazon, and so on.

Aurora Innovation has been an exception to the trend, staying independent while developing an automated-driving system it hopes to one day sell to trucking and auto companies. But its lack of a deep-pocketed parent hasn't damaged its reputation, at least not among venture capitalists.

Olaf Sakkers, a partner at the venture-capital firm Maniv Mobility, told Business Insider that Aurora has "an aura of legitimacy" that matches those of rivals backed by large corporations.

When Business Insider asked Sakkers and six other VCs which autonomous-vehicle startups they believe have the most promise, Sakkers and three others picked Aurora. No other company received as many endorsements.

The four VCs, none of whom works for a firm that has invested in Aurora, gave two main reasons why they believe Aurora is primed for success.

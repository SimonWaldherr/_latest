<div><p>Srikanthi Rodrigo-Candappa&#8217;s knee had been troubling her for 15 years, when her GP finally said that it was time to consider a knee replacement. After a three-month wait, the 68-year-old was booked in for what she hoped would be a life-changing operation on March 23.</p>
<p>Two days before she was due to go in, the operation was cancelled, as nearly all routine treatments were. It was a bitter disappointment &#8211; and seven months on, Srikanthi is still in constant pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walking is difficult as well as climbing stairs, but sleeping is the most troubled time and so that then impacts on my day as I&#8217;m tired a lot,&#8221; says Srikanthi, who lives with her husband in Hertfordshire and still works as a personal assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thought that by now, after the operation and recovery, I would be up and walking again and that I would get some of my old life back.&#8221;&#160;She now has a consultation booked for early November &#8211; but with no indication when the surgery might be scheduled for.</p>
<p>&#8220;My consultant says that the NHS has learned from the last lockdown and that routine operations like this will be going ahead in a totally Covid-free hospital,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I am worried that a second wave might affect my next operation, but let&#8217;s wait and see.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The pain of waiting</h3>
<p>Dr Wendy Holden, consultant rheumatologist at the Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Arthritis Action&#8217;s medical advisor, says that many people around the country have been left in pain, thanks to their surgeries getting cancelled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orthopaedic clinics and elective surgery have resumed but with very reduced capacity due to social distancing and a long backlog of patients who were already desperate to have surgery as they had run out of other options. Unfortunately, we are now seeing patients who have severe pain and mobility issues who can now expect to wait a year or even more for their surgery, effectively sentencing them to another year of sometimes intolerable pain and disability.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/09/coronavirus-crisis-reverses-years-nhs-waiting-list-progress/">She says that the delays will add extra burden to the NHS</a>. &#8220;During this time, these patients will lose fitness to help them cope after surgery, may well gain weight and will need additional GP and hospital appointments to help with pain management and medication prescriptions. Patients of working age may lose further time from work.&#8221;</p>

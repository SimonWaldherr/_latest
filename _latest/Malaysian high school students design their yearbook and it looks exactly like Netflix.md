If you're Malaysian, you'll most likely be familiar with the concept of helping design and curate the class page for your senior class in the school yearbook.

If you've never come across it before, it's a pretty common thing in Malaysian high schools for Form 5 (senior) students to have all the creative agency to design their class page in the yearbook.

It's kind of a way for students to leave their mark and do something fun before leaving school forever. That being said, I vaguely remember mine but it was definitely not as cool this one.

This bunch of students were inspired by other classes and schools doing a Spotify inspired layout and wanted to take it to the next level by emulating Netflix's classic layout.

According to JUICE, it went viral on Twitter when one of the students, Adam Syafi Bin Mohamed Amir from the creative team tweeted it:

This led to an avalanche of students from other schools sharing their super cool and creative ideas:

Adam said his discussion with his classmates regarding the Netflix theme began in early January, right before Malaysia was hit with the inevitable wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and a strict lockdown.

Only in June were they able to make any real progress, after returning to school, balancing studying for SPM (the national board examinations) and well, the stress that comes with living in a pandemic.

All these creative and fun yearbook ideas are making me wish I was back in high school again. I would've had way better ideas for my senior page.

In all seriousness, it's truly admirable that these students were able to keep their heads up amidst the stress of school, the lockdown and the looming threat of the virus.

Hopefully they're able to sign off high school in a memorable way despite the current situation. You only get to be a teenager once after all.

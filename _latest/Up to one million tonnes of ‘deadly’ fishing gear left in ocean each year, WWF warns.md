  Up to one million tonnes of ‘deadly’ fishing gear left in ocean each year, WWF warns 
description: > 
  Up to one million tonnes of fishing gear is left in the ocean each year, creating “deadly” debris for marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles, conservationists have warned.The organisation has also urged countries to join the Global Ghost Gear Initiative, an alliance of the fishing industry, academics and other groups, focused on addressing the problem worldwide.A separate report by Greenpeace Germany found an estimated 640,000 tonnes of ghost gear entered the ocean each year, making up about 10 per cent of plastic waste in the ocean.Marine debris affects two-thirds of marine mammals, such as porpoises, half of seabirds and all species of sea turtles, according to the WWF.It added that existing programmes, such as “fish for litter” schemes which reward fishers for bringing back marine debris, should be encouraged further.

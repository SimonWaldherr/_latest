The Carousel of Hope Ball is traditionally held every two years in Los Angeles, California at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, but this year of course proved different.

For the first time since its inception in 1978, the 34th annual edition of the starry fundraiser gala went virtual, welcoming celebrities including Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton, George Clooney, Oprah and Tom Hanks via video meeting on Saturday night.

The event, this year hosted by Jay Leno as the master of ceremonies, has to date raised over $110 million dollars towards finding a cure for diabetes.

Sweethearts Stefani and Shelton serenaded viewers of the event – which was available for public viewing for the first time in the event's history.

The event also welcomed performances and special appearances from other stars, like Burt Bacharach, Tony Bennett, Andrea Bocelli, Clive Davis, Kenny Babyface Edmonds, Josh Groban, Cynthia Erivo, Sam Smith, Jennifer Hudson, Gladys Knight, Adam Lambert, Barry Manilow, Diane Warren and Dionne Warwick.

Jane Fonda, David Geffen, Anjelica Huston, Rob Lowe, Henry Winkler, Samuel L. Jackson, Maria Shriver, Judge Judy Sheindlin, Dame Joan Collins and Robert De Niro were some of the other stars to attend and participate in the event.

Carousel Chairman Barbara Davis – who turns 90 this year – and her committee organized fundraising at the gala through sponsorships, a live and silent auction, underwriting and contributions.

Proceeds of the event benefit the Children’s Diabetes Foundation and the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes – which fetes its 40th anniversary this year.

Sir Michael Caine, David Copperfield, John Elway, Lionel Richie, Sir Rod Stewart, Pia Toscano, and Usher also joined the starry line-up.

That event honored Robert De Niro with the Brass Ring Award – a prestigious prize previously bestowed upon the likes of Frank Sinatra, Hillary Clinton, Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, Clooney, Fonda, Sir Sidney Poitier, David Foster, Halle Berry, Sherry Lansing and more.

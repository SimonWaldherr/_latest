Ever since she retired from movie acting in 2014, she's learned to enjoy the finer things in life.

And Cameron Diaz was seen in a lovely and slightly silly Instagram video on Friday, to plug her very own wine brand Avaline.

The Mask star, 48, was seen looking utterly carefree and beautiful in a sunlit vineyard, wearing a strappy white top over a purple bra.

The mother-of-one had her blond hair pulled back into an easy ponytail, with wispy tendrils framing her famous face.

Smiling, Cameron started the clip by joyfully picking a grape from the vine next to her.

Then, she dropped the fruit, looking off camera as she reached up as if to pick another.

Instead, her hand came back into frame with... a bottle of her white wine, branded Avaline.

'Mmm,' the actress exclaimed.

Then, she reached out of frame again, saying 'OK!' as she came back with a glass of wine ready to be sipped.

And sip Diaz did, after which she said, 'Ahh, fresh!'

At the very end of the clip, the Being John Malkovich actress burst out laughing, clearly aware of how ridiculous the clip in fact was.

Cameron captioned the snippet, 'Fresh, delicious, made with certified organic grapes #ahhvaline @avaline'.

Diaz, along with her Avaline co-founder Katherine Power, announced last month the arrival of their red vintage, which became available at select wine retailers in early October.

The release joined their portfolio of vegan wines – they already had a white and a rosé – made with organic grapes and without unnecessary additives.

Since the launch of the White and Rosé in July, over 120,000 bottles of wine have been sold.

In July Diaz said: 'I enjoyed wine for many-a-year and never questioned it... but I had no idea of the process... We soon learned it wasn't what you added, it's what you didn't add.'

The star met Katherine through her sister-in-law Nicole Richie, and the friendship soon blossomed into their business partnership.

Avaline White is a dry wine with a crisp, fresh finish and comes from Spain.

Cameron last starred alongside Jamie Foxx and Rose Byrne in the 2014 feature adaptation of the Broadway musical Annie.

Aging is far from a new problem for the Senate, where both parties reward seniority and are reluctant to push their elders aside. Ms. Feinstein’s allies insist she will play her role with dignity and force, and Democrats have quietly put in place plans to keep her at the periphery of the action, leaving public appearances to other party leaders and ensuring that she will rarely be called upon to make unscripted remarks. But rarely has someone with Ms. Feinstein’s limitations been asked to take so prominent a stage in a battle fraught with such political risk.

“What is different here is the heightened scrutiny and the fact, to a significant degree, that everything is on the line when it comes to this nomination,” said James P. Manley, who served as a senior aide to former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who as the majority leader had to manage an aging Robert C. Byrd as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. “The groups want blood. Democrats on and off the committee want a real fight.”

“The question I have,” Mr. Manley continued, “is whether that is going to be able to happen with her as the ranking member of the committee.”

This being the Senate, the hand-wringing has produced little by way of direct action so far. Out of respect, none of her colleagues would state their concerns on the record.

For her part, Ms. Feinstein hopes to use the hearings to reassure her colleagues she can still hold her own as the senior Democrat on the committee and be trusted to take the gavel as chairwoman if her party reclaims the majority next month. Ms. Feinstein is expected to hew closely to an opening statement prepared with staff, and leave any procedural brawling to lower-ranking Democrats.

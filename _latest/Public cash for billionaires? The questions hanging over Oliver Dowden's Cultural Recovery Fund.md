This week saw some succour for the arts. The award of £257 million in grants to British organisations has finally been announced. This money will come from the £1.57 billion Culture Recovery Fund, and it’s designed to tide businesses over until April 2021.

But will it be enough? And what happens if we’re still in some form of lockdown at that point? The Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, today warned the DCMS select committee that the arts are facing “strong headwinds” when it comes to reaching that mystical Stage 5: reopening venues without social distancing.

What is the plan? Dowden claimed that work towards Stage 5 was continuing behind-the-scenes, including preparation for pilots at a time when mass testing is available, meaning that audiences or visitors can produce tests done on the day. But he was unwilling to commit to a “not-before date”, his reasoning being that people might invest in productions or events which then couldn’t go ahead.

Dowden was asked, too, about the safety of indoor performances, after this week’s controversy over a London Palladium event in which patrons appeared to be seated close together. He admitted that, with outdoor sports crowds now prohibited until spring, on the grounds of the risk of transmission, there’s “a question of whether you stop” indoor performances as well.

Still, he added, there’s currently only a small “volume of them” – not least because, as the arts world has been saying for months, they’re “not massively financially viable”.

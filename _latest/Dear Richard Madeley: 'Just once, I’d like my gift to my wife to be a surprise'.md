Dear Richard

My wife has an unerring gift for “accidentally” finding birthday and Christmas presents ahead of time.

I don’t think I am being too careless about where I hide them – rather that she seems to make a determined effort to track them down. She claims it doesn’t matter and always makes the right noises on the day itself but, to be honest, it’s started to grate – it takes the fun out of it all.

Should I just hand over a voucher of appropriate value in future? Hide a “dummy gift” and keep the real one in plain sight, like Edgar Allan Poe’s Purloined Letter? Any bright ideas?

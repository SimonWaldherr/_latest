<div><p>Each viewing does have its upsides. Even after 26 viewings, one cannot help but admire the opening hovercraft chase, and it remains a treat to see Pierce Brosnan and Toby Stephens swashing buckles in a thrillingly choreographed swordfight. We have also found that the deeper we have got into the film, the keener we have become to devise elaborate backstories for characters who make the most fleeting of appearances &#8211; I&#8217;d be very grateful if Ian Pirie could get in touch to explain how he conceptualized his South African thug, and whether it matches up with any of our 54 (and counting) ideas.</p>
<p>Every silver lining, of course, has its cloud, and we have found no dearth of low points in the film. Bond&#8217;s flirtatious overtures to Halle Berry&#8217;s character seem more and more like legally actionable harassment with every passing watch, and the pseudo-scientific explanation of the invisible car continues to baffle. Worst of all, we hadn&#8217;t really clocked the run-time of the film before we started. What I had remembered as a fast-paced 90-minute romp actually extends to two and a quarter hours. Had we plumped for the similarly panned but far shorter Quantum of Solace we would so far have saved almost 12 hours of our lives.</p>
<p>A thought that occurs to us every now and again is when can we call an end to this project? Rather foolishly we got into this without really considering an answer to that question. We have stumbled into a morale-sapping and costly project with no obvious end in sight, and all because we failed to consider in advance what a realistic endpoint would look like. At least we&#8217;re not alone in that.</p>

Cory Sandhagen was willing to leave the octagon with one less limb before tapping out to Iuri Alcantara.

In his return to bantamweight following a lengthy run at 145 pounds, Sandhagen faced Alcantara at UFC Fight Night 135 in August 2018, in a fight in which the Elevation Fight Team athlete showed incredible toughness.

Sandhagen found himself battling some early adversity when he was caught with a flurry, then a deep armbar that he somehow survived. Alcantara had Sandhagen’s arm fully extended, but a bloodied up Sandhagen refused to tap and eventually managed to escape.

Sandhagen then wound up in top position and proceeded to rain down heavy ground and pound on Alcantara, who found himself in trouble of his own but managed to last the round.

In Round 2, Sandhagen was able to stun Alcantara right off the bat and continued to punish him on the ground until the referee finally stopped the fight 61 seconds into the frame.

Sandhagen would go on to win his next three in a row, including victories over John Lineker and Raphael Assuncao. He saw that winning streak come to a halt when he was quickly submitted by Aljamain Sterling in his past outing at UFC 250 in June.

Sandhagen (12-2 MMA, 5-1 UFC) returns Saturday against Marlon Moraes (23-6-1 MMA, 5-2 UFC) in the UFC on ESPN+ 37 headliner, which takes place at Flash Forum at Yas Island in Abu Dhabi.

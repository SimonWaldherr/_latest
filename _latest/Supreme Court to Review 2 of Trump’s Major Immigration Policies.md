  Supreme Court to Review 2 of Trump’s Major Immigration Policies 
description: > 
  In a second brief, the administration said the pandemic did not make the case less urgent.“The current suspension on introducing certain aliens is a temporary response to the pandemic,” the brief said.But the Supreme Court, in a pair of interim orders decided by 5-to-4 votes, had allowed construction to continue until it either denies the administration’s petition seeking review or agrees to hear the administration’s appeal and rules on it.The case arose from Mr. Trump’s efforts to make good on a campaign promise to build the barrier.After Congress appropriated only a fraction of what Mr. Trump had sought, he announced that he would act unilaterally to spend billions more.

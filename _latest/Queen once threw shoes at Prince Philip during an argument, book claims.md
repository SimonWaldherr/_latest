<div><p>It appears even the Queen gets peeved by her husband.</p>
<p>In the newly released biography &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prince-Philip-Biography-Ingrid-Seward/dp/1982129751/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3II90IRGFWK4W&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=prince+philip+revealed&amp;qid=1603215431&amp;sprefix=prince+philip+re%2Caps%2C162&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=pagesix-20">Prince Philip Revealed</a>,&#8221; author Ingrid Seward writes of a right royal dustup between Queen Elizabeth II and husband Prince Philip while they were on a tour of Australia in 1954.</p>
<p>The couple, who wed in 1947, was afforded a rare weekend off during their tour but were trailed by a camera crew filming a documentary about the visit Down Under. According to the book, a camera operator was horrified to see Philip charging out of the couple&#8217;s chalet, &#8220;followed by a flying pair of tennis shoes and a racket and a very angry Queen shouting for him to come back. Then the indignant Queen grabbed hold of her husband and dragged him back inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a stunned silence before the royal press secretary strode over and told the crew to shut off the cameras or they would be arrested, according to the book. The offending film was reportedly handed over and given to the monarch.</p>
<p>The Queen reportedly came out to meet the crew and thanked them for the film.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for that little interlude,&#8221; she said, according to the book. &#8220;But as you know it happens in every marriage. Now, what would you like me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seward writes that the couple, who have been married 73 years, had their squabbles through the years.</p>
<p>Philip could be &#8220;very tough&#8221; on the Queen and frequently called her a &#8220;bloody fool and accused her of talking rubbish,&#8221; Seward claims.</p>
<p>The Queen, perhaps used to being diplomatic, &#8220;seldom answered back but would change the subject and started talking in riddles that would divert him as he tried to figure out what she was talking about,&#8221; the book says.</p>
<p>Philip, who turned 99 years old in June, retired from royal duties in 2017. The Queen, who is 94, carried out her first public engagement since Britain&#8217;s coronavirus lockdown last week where she visited the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory with her grandson Prince William.</p>

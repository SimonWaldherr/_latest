  Trump returns to Pennsylvania; Biden stays off trail for debate prep 
description: > 
  Trump told supporters in the northwestern corner of Pennsylvania that had it not been for the coronavirus pandemic upending the economy he would never have come back to Erie to campaign.Trump blames the public health crisis for damaging his reelection bid, suggesting he would have won on the strong economy.“We had this thing won, we were so far up, we had the greatest economy ever, greatest jobs, greatest everything,” Trump said.Hello, Erie, can I please have your vote?”In 2016, Trump flipped Pennsylvania and the longtime Democratic stronghold Erie County in a stunning upset.The rally, shorter than most (which Trump blamed on it being cold), was an abbreviated version of Trump’s standard fare threatening a socialist, crime-ridden America if Biden wins.

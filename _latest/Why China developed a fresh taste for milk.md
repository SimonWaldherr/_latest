<div><p>China&#8217;s appetite for milk has exploded in recent years. The nation of nearly 1.4 billion people is now the world&#8217;s second largest consumer of dairy products, and imports are flying over the border, with dairies from New Zealand to Germany topping off the behemoth&#8217;s demands for milk.</p>
<p>An intriguing little detail in all this frothy commerce is that many people in China, like much of Asia, are lactose intolerant. Human children produce an enzyme that allows them to digest milk, but in much of the world, its levels taper off as they grow up.</p>
<p>People of European descent are somewhat unusual in that they mostly continue to digest dairy effortlessly as adults. In China, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6235167/">a much-cited study</a> estimated that 92% of adults had trouble absorbing lactose; more recently, China&#8217;s preventative medicine agency suggested that by the time kids are 11 to 13 years old, around 40% have lost the ability to digest it.</p>
<p>So how exactly is all this milk swilling working, and how did China come to have such gusto for dairy?</p>

<p>For most of the 20th Century, milk had a relatively low profile in China, says Thomas Dubois, a professor of humanities at Beijing Normal University, who has <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-24363-0_6">studied the nation&#8217;s dairy industry</a>. There were many tiny dairy farms in the northeast, with an average of four cows a farm, and their milk made its way by train to the Russian-influenced city of Harbin, where most of it was made into butter and cheese. Bigger dairies eventually appeared in coastal cities, however. With several dips caused by invasions, famines, and other downturns, large-scale production gathered speed.</p>
<p>By the 1980s in China, powdered milk was a health product, and it was generally used for babies and for older folks. In the early 80s there was a run on milk in Beijing, Dubois relates, and people were waiting in line all night for it. &#8220;You had a really strict ration on how much you were able to get for your household,&#8221; says Dubois. &#8220;This was really, really prized.</p></div>

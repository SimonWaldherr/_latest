Tory Lanez claims the “truth” will come out after he was charged Thursday with shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the foot this summer.

“[Time] will [tell],” Lanez tweeted on Friday using emojis. “And the truth will come to the light … I have all faith in God to show that … love to all my fans and people that have stayed true to me & know my heart.”

The 28-year-old “LUV” rapper reminded fans that a “charge is not a conviction,” and added, “If you have supported me or meg thru this, I genuinely appreciate u.”

The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office announced Thursday that Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, faces one felony count each of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle.

Megan, 25, has not spoken out about the charges, and a rep for the “WAP” rapper declined to comment.

However, she has been vocal on social media, alleging that Lanez was the person who shot her.

“Yes, this n—a Tory shot me,” Megan claimed in a video in August. “You shot me, and you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lyin’ and s–t. Stop lyin’. Why lie?”

The “Savage” rapper also posted photos of her stitches getting removed after the alleged shooting.

Meanwhile, Lanez denied that he shot Megan through his new album, “Daystar,” which was met with a lot of criticism. Fans accused the “Money Over Fallouts” rapper of trying to “capitalize” on the scandal.

Lanez is scheduled to be arraigned Oct. 13 in Los Angeles County Superior Court. If convicted, he could face up to 22 years in prison.

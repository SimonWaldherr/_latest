<div><p>Where else would you rather, or indeed where else can you legally, be? What's the latest: you can go in a pub but not with anyone you don't know unless one of you is Bubble in Big Brother? I forget. Anyway. one place you definitely can't be is Elland Road, but at the very least you can follow the action along with us on this live blog. t's two of the most charismatic and thoughtful managers in the League, it's two exciting and progressive sides, it's Leeds vs Wolves and we will have the team news at 7pm and the kick off at 8pm.</p>
<p>A nice variation on pundit staple "the table doesn't lie" here from Marcelo. &#8220;While the points give you a position in the table, they don&#8217;t tell you the tendencies that there were in these games," Bielsa says.</p>
<blockquote>
Marcelo Bielsa remains wary of letting Leeds United&#8217;s impressive start to the season convince them their return to the Premier League is going to be easier than they thought.
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/03/leeds-united-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-live-score-latest/">Leeds have held Manchester City to a draw</a>,&#160;
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/09/12/liverpool-vs-leeds-united-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">narrowly lost at champions Liverpool</a>&#160;on the opening day of the season and have beaten Fulham and Sheffield United. Those seven points are a solid platform to build on, but Bielsa has been around long enough to know a good start is only that.

<p>You could argue I guess that Wolves are exactly the sort of benchmark Leeds could do with, five games in. The one point from six vs City and Liverpool is one more than they would have hoped for, and six points vs Sheff United and Fulham is very acceptable but hardly stunning. I suppose Wolves would be then template for stabilising in the PL and then kicking on.</p>
<p>Talking of Fulham, Wolves put them away without much fuss recently.&#160;</p>

<p>Perhaps more worrying than that was the fact that they have a few Portugal players who have been in contact with He Who Must Not Be Named. They've pulled up okay, by the sounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/14/portugal-internationals-wont-have-quarantine-return-premier/">Portugal internationals won't have to quarantine on return to Premier League after Cristiano Ronaldo positive test</a></p>
<blockquote>
Portugal internationals returning to their Premier League clubs will not have to automatically quarantine on their return to England despite the fact
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/13/cristiano-ronaldo-tests-positive-coronavirus/">&#160;team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has tested positive for Coronavirus</a>.Wolverhampton Wanderers have Rui Patricio, Nelson Semedo, Joao Moutinho, Ruben Neves and Daniel Podence in the Portugal squad that has been training with Ronaldo during the international break.

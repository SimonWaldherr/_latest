<div><p>Frank Vandenbroucke says situation in parts of country is &#8216;most dangerous in all of Europe&#8217;</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/belgium" class="u-underline">Belgium</a> is losing control of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and is very close to being overwhelmed by a &#8220;tsunami&#8221; of infection, the country&#8217;s health minister has said.</p>
<p>Frank Vandenbroucke, the federal minister, told the broadcaster RTL that Belgians needed to radically alter their behaviour.</p>
<p>He described the situation in Francophone Wallonia in the south and in the country&#8217;s capital, Brussels, as &#8220;the worst, and therefore the most dangerous in all of Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We are the most affected region in all of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" class="u-underline">Europe</a>. We are really close to a tsunami &#8230; that we no longer control what is happening. Today, we can still control what is happening, but with enormous difficulties and stress.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it continues to increase, the number of hospitalisations will be such that we will have to postpone more and more non-Covid care, which is also very dangerous. [The government] has only one message to the public: protect yourself, protect your loved ones, so as not to be contaminated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s comments came as government&#8217;s latest restrictions intended to control the spread came into force.</p>
 
<p>For four weeks from Monday, all bars and restaurants will be closed. The sale of alcohol will be banned after 8pm and a curfew will be imposed between midnight and 5am.</p>
<p>People will only be allowed to have one &#8220;close contact&#8221; outside their own household. Four guests, changeable every two weeks, may visit homes if they keep a distance when inside.</p>
<p>The new Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, had said on Friday the situation facing the country was &#8220;more serious&#8221; than it had been in March before the first nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>Behind-the-scenes the government had been torn over how to respond to the spiralling number of infections. But Vandenbroucke, with the prime minister&#8217;s support, ultimately convinced sceptics in the government that social contacts in the hospitality sector had been fuelling the crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing is people&#8217;s behaviour,&#8221; Vandenbroucke said. &#8220;They must understand that they must protect themselves and their loved ones, therefore respect the distance, wear the mask if there is no distance, limit the number of contacts&#8230; This is essential. I can only repeat: the virus is no one&#8217;s fault, so let&#8217;s not make one or the other feel guilty. But now, rectifying this situation is everyone&#8217;s responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government has faced criticism over its track and trace system with the sheer number of people seeking a test causing delays in results being provided.</p>
<p>The mayor of Namur, Maxime Pr&#233;vot, said: &#8220;There is clearly a problem today in terms of testing, and even more so in terms of tracing. We do not have effective monitoring. We have kilometres of lines [of people] to be tested, then we wait days and days to have the results.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Walloon minister of health, Christie Morreale, admitted that the system was under unprecedented strain. &#8220;The laboratories are working at full speed. And Belgium is one of the EU countries which tests the most, But at some point, when there are too many patients, the system cracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belgium has recorded 605 infections per 100,000 people over the last 14 days, second only to the Czech Republic, which has 771, according to the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>
<p>The average number of new daily infections between 8 and 14 October stood at 7,388.1, an increase of 88% on the previous seven days. Between 11 and 17 October there were an average of 233.9 daily admissions to hospital, a 96% increase on the previous week.</p>

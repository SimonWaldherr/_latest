The coronavirus pandemic is unlike anything any of us have ever experienced before, and the impact it's having on our work and personal lives can feel overwhelming.

One in four people have experienced a mental health problem during their lifetime and these can be made worse by big life changes, such as losing a loved one or a job.

Lloyds Bank, in partnership with Mental Health UK, is working to ensure those affected by the current climate know they're not alone.

Read on to find out how and learn about what you can do to put your mind at rest and help with your finances.

Why we need to look after our mental and financial health right now

Focusing on burnout this World Mental Health Day October 10 is World Mental Health Day, and Lloyds Bank, in partnership with Mental Health UK, can offer you support and advice. Their prime focus this year is the physical and emotional exhaustion many are experiencing during lockdown – otherwise known as burnout – which can harm your mental health if unchecked. Symptoms of this can include fatigue, muscle tension and lack of energy, as well as low moods, emotional outbursts and increased irritability.

Over the past few months, business owners and employees have had to bear the brunt of the economic consequences of the pandemic, with lockdown in March pushing the UK into recession for the first time in 11 years.

Companies have had to let staff go as their incomes fall, while millions of employees have been placed on furlough, having their wages topped up by the government under the job retention scheme.

There are also predictions of more job cuts in the future as government support is rolled back.

The cumulative effect of all these factors can increase people's risk of burnout, which is the emotional and physical exhaustion caused by prolonged periods of stress.



To help, here are some tips from Lloyds Bank and Mental Health UK for what you can do to improve your mental wellbeing and future-proof your finances during these uncertain times.

Talk it out

There is nothing wrong with being concerned about your job or the economy – but keeping issues to yourself could add to stress and anxiety. In fact, Mental Health UK research found 83 per cent of people agree that money worries could contribute to burnout.

Talking about a problem, however, can raise solutions and make you feel better.

Speak with your manager if you're concerned about your job as they could put your mind at ease. Loved ones can also provide a sympathetic ear for whatever situation you find yourself in.

Lloyds Bank offers tips and tools on dealing with mental health, COVID-19 and money worries and you can also seek free expert advice through the Mental Health UK website.

The importance of budgeting

The Mental Health and Money Advice service – set up by Mental Health UK with the support of Lloyds Bank fundraising – says the combination of financial and mental health issues can form a vicious cycle.

People with mental health issues often find it harder to keep on top of their bills and may have sporadic spending patterns, which can potentially cause money and mental health issues to spiral.

The first step is to check your income and expenditure so you know how much money you need to get through the month, and see if you can make any cuts, such as unused subscriptions.

Lloyds Bank also has guidance on where to start if you are struggling to pay your bills and the Mental Health and Money Advice service has a free online budgeting tool.

If you're unable to pay your bills, get free expert debt advice on the Mental Health and Money Advice website or by contacting National Debt Line or StepChange.

It's time to take a close look at your finances to see how and where you can save yourself money

Think about preparing your finances should you fall out of work too. It's often recommended to have a fund of three to six months of your salary.

Don’t forget to check for state benefits such as Universal Credit that you could be entitled to if you lose your job.

Find out about your benefit entitlements by using the Turn2us online benefits calculator, or contact your local Citizen’s Advice or search for benefits advisers on the Turn2us website for support.

Look after your mental health

Your mental health is as important as your physical and financial wellbeing.

Mental Health UK suggests getting enough sleep, practising mindfulness and meditation, eating healthily, keeping active and connecting with others.

Filling your time with worthwhile activities such as volunteering, pursuing a hobby, cooking or even finally getting fit can all help you feel better too.

Katie Legg, Director of Strategy and Partnerships for Mental Health UK, says:

'It is so important to be managing all the things that are important to our mental health because there is so much doubt and uncertainty at the moment.

'That can range from things like our relationships, jobs and our money.

‘If you’re struggling at the moment, our Mental Health and Money Advice website has a wealth of tools to help people manage their finances and plan their budgeting.

‘Reach out to us and loved ones if you need help, and don’t forget to be kind to yourself.’

Fiona Cannon, Group Sustainable Business Director at Lloyds Bank, adds: ‘The most important thing is for customers to get the support they need.

‘They are not alone and it’s really important that people understand the advice and support is out there to help them.’

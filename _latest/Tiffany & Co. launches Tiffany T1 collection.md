While the coronavirus pandemic may have put a damper on some of the biggest fashion drops and events slated for May, such as the Met Gala, Tiffany & Co. is still surging into spring with the launch of its Tiffany T1 collection.

The legendary New York jeweler debuted its latest line at the beginning of the month and will be unveiling additional pieces in a series of global releases throughout the year. Chief Artistic Officer Reed Krakoff has reinterpreted the brand’s famous “T” motif, which has been the inspiration behind many designs since the 1980s.

“While designing Tiffany T1, we wanted to honor the legacy of the iconic ‘T’ motif, but also elevate and modernize it with hand-set diamonds in the beveled edges,” Krakoff says in a statement. “Through these pieces, we convey that precious stones aren’t just for special occasions — they can be worn every day as a celebration of yourself.”

Nine 18-karat rose gold bracelets and rings in varying widths have dropped, and five of the designs feature pavé diamonds hand-set by artisans in a honeycomb pattern for maximum radiance.

Prices range from $850 to $28,000. An exclusive necklace featuring more than 240 diamonds and weighing 14 carats — which costs a whopping $150,000 — was also released for the collection’s debut.

Additional 18-karat white and yellow gold pieces and more pendants, bracelets, rings and earrings with baguette diamonds are set to launch in the fall.

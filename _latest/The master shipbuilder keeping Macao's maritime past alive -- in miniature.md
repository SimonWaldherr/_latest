Every day, the 71-year-old spends hours at an abandoned Macao shipyard, hunched over a table, hard at work. With only stray dogs for company and a single electric fan to keep him cool, he meticulously hand-crafts the sort of fishing boats that have been made here for generations. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">But none of his creations will ever set sail. In fact, Tam's boats are miniatures designed to preserve the city's disappearing heritage. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"There is so much history in the fishing and shipbuilding industries," he says. "I make model boats to show the craftsmanship and the building process (and) to educate people." </p><p id="ad_rect_atf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">For centuries, the shipping industry was at the heart of life in Macao, a former Portuguese colony that was transformed from a small fishing village to a major port. In recent years, however, casinos have taken over as the city's main source of income.</p><p class="BasicArticle__caption">Historic ship replicas nod to Macao's maritime past  <p class="BasicArticle__credit"></p><p class="BasicArticle__credit"></p></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">And with mainland China able to produce state-of-the-art metal fishing vessels, quicker and at lower costs, demand for traditional wooden boats all but disappeared. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">No new boats have been made here since 2006. Not full-sized ones, at least. </p><p id="ad_nat_btf_01" class="Ad__tag"></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Three years ago, Tam -- who is considered a "sifu," or master, of his craft -- was commissioned by a local temple to recreate a so-called "junk" boat in miniature form. He has since produced more than a dozen replicas of the very boats he spent his career making. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"We're not just building models," he said. "It's about craftsmanship, shipbuilding and history."  </p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190816121132-artisans-macao-shipbuilder-8.jpg" alt="Tam's makeshift studio is locatetd in an abandoned shipyard in the coastal Lai Chi Vun village."><p class="BasicArticle__caption">Tam's makeshift studio is locatetd in an abandoned shipyard in the coastal Lai Chi Vun village.  <p class="BasicArticle__credit">Credit: </p><p class="BasicArticle__credit">Herbert Chow </p></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"><h3>Turning the tide </h3></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Tam's makeshift studio lies in an abandoned shipyard in Macao's Lai Chi Vun village. The space, which is crumbling at its edges having endured several of the region's worst tropical storms, is a shadow of its former self. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">But for Tam, working in the very places he spent his youth is about more than finding a convenient studio -- it allows him to reminisce about the industry's boom era. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Shipbuilding in Macao hit its peak in the 1950s, when there were almost 30 shipyards across the region. By the 1980s however, the industry was in steep decline. Today, the wooden junks that once dotted the shores of Macao, and neighboring Hong Kong, have ceased to exist, save for a handful of tourist boats. </p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190816115520-artisans-macao-shipbuilder-4.jpg" alt="Macao's shipbuilding industry hit its peak  in the 1950s, but saw a steep decline by the 1980s.

"I wonder how it went downhill so fast. How could I have known this would happen in my generation?"</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">According to Tam, this decline didn't just affect shipbuilders, but all aspects of life in Lai Chi Vun. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"At the (industry's) peak, people were rushing to work and it was lively. Those were happy times. We would work all year round and have people here dining together. Now, no one comes here to work, so no one comes here to talk to you."</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"><h3>'Like a human body'</h3></p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Tam believes that the miniature boats he creates are more than just models.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"The shipbuilding process is the same," he said. "The only difference is the tools used." </p><img class="Image__image" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190816172416-shipbuilding-1.jpg" alt="Tam says he uses the same building techniques on his miniatures, as he used on his real ships.

If you don't have hands or feet, you can't eat or walk. No one part is more important than the other -- without each part, the boat cannot be completed."</p><a></a><p>In 2018, Macao's government <a href="https://www.macaubusiness.com/macau-govt-finishes-lai-chi-vun-shipyards-listing/" target="_blank">recognized</a> the Lai Chi Vun shipyard as a cultural heritage site. But the future of this craft -- and the culture surrounding it -- is dependent on the next generation, he says.</p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"Some people have started (providing miniature shipbuilding) classes in order to teach young people these skills, and to promote this culture," he adds. </p><p class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"You need people to help with the preservation -- without the help of people, these skills will be lost."</p></div>

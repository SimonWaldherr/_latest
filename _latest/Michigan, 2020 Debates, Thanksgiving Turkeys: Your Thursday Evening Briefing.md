1. The authorities in Michigan charged 13 men with terrorism and conspiracy charges in what they said was a plot to storm the State Capitol, kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and start a civil war.

At least six of the extremists met repeatedly over the summer for firearms and combat training and tried to build explosives, according to a criminal complaint. The F.B.I. believed the men were planning to buy explosives this week for their plot. At least five of the men have been arrested.

Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat, pictured in January, has become a focal point of antigovernment views and dissatisfaction over coronavirus control measures. “I knew this job would be hard,” Ms. Whitmer said in reaction to news of the arrests. “But I’ll be honest, I never could have imagined anything like this.”

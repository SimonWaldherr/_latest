  Touchdown! NASA makes historic touchdown on asteroid Bennu to collect rock samples 
description: > 
  AdvertisementNASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has made a historic touchdown on the asteroid Bennu and collected samples from its surface for several seconds before backing away Tuesday evening.NASA 's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has made a historic landing on the asteroid Bennu and collected samples from its surface for several seconds before backing away Tuesday evening.The asteroid Bennu pictured above in this NASA image dated November 16, 2018.NASA's OSIRIS-Rex mission will land on Bennu on October 20 to collect samples of the space rock.OSIRIS-REx, was launched four years ago in September 2016 to collect data and samples from the rare B-type asteroid.

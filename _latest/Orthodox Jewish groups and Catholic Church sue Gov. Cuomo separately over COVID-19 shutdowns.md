  Orthodox Jewish groups and Catholic Church sue Gov. Cuomo separately over COVID-19 shutdowns 
description: > 
  “It appears the Governor may have been responding to certain press reports documenting COVID-19 outbreaks within the Orthodox Jewish community,” reads the Catholic Church’s lawsuit.“Despite his focus on COVID-19 outbreaks in certain geographically concentrated, socially insular religious communities located within the targeted areas... the Governor has made no attempt to ameliorate the disproportionate hardship the Initiative will effect on other communities, like the Diocese’s faith community.”

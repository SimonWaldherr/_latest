<div><p>Ministers have threatened to strip Sadiq Khan of control of London's transport network&#160;unless he agrees to hike council tax and&#160;fares&#160;and extend the congestion charge zone, in return for funding.</p>
<p>Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, hit the London mayor with a series of demands in return for a &#163;4.9bn bailout from Westminster to rescue Transport for London (TfL).</p>
<p>Ministers could seize&#160;direct control of TL if Mr Khan, who is its chairman, refuses to slash costs, raise fares and launch a&#160;tax raid, Mr Shapps warned.</p>
<p>Mr Khan said he could not accept the Government's plan that would impose higher costs on Londoners and choke off the capital's economic recovery.</p>
<p>"It is clear that difficult choices lie ahead to plug the huge gap the pandemic left in TfL's finances. I have been ready to talk with Government about how the necessary funds can be raised &#8211; but a proposal which singles out Londoners for punishment is completely unacceptable, as well as making no economic sense,"&#160;he said.</p>
<p>"I urge ministers to come back to the table with a revised proposal which does not punish Londoners for doing the right thing to tackle Covid-19 &#8211; and to publish their review into TfL's finances in full. I remain ready to talk."</p>
<p>TfL has pleaded for government help after passenger numbers collapsed due to coronavirus. Westminster handed Mr Khan &#163;1.6bn in May to help the transport authority&#160;survive the following&#160;six months.</p>
<p>But with experts predicting it could be years before public transport use returns to pre-Covid levels, TfL has asked for almost &#163;5bn to get through the 18 months.</p>
<p>Talks have been ongoing for weeks to break the deadlock as politicians in Westminster attempt to impose a slew of reforms on Mr Khan.</p>

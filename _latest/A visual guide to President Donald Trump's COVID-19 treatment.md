As the U.S. death toll from coronavirus neared 210,000, President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 2 that he and his wife Melania had tested positive for COVID-19. The disclosure came in a tweet issued at 12:54 a.m.

At 244 pounds, Trump, 74, is considered slightly obese, putting him in a higher-risk category for the disease. Since his announcement, White House officials issued conflicting statements about the president's health during his stay at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

Here's a day-by-day account:

Day 1: Friday, Oct. 2

Late Friday morning, Trump is diagnosed with a high fever and an oxygen blood saturation level of less than 94%. Normal levels are 95% to 100%. Trump is given supplemental oxygen. White House physician Sean Conley releases these details to the public, but not until Sunday.

At 6:31 p.m., Trump tweets an 18-second video in which he announces he's going to the Walter Reed medical center. "I think I'm doing very well but we're going to make sure that things work out," he says. "The first lady is doing very well."

The president is given an experimental antibody cocktail, a combination of two antibodies designed to attack a specific protein of the coronavirus. He also takes his first dose of remdesivir, an antiviral drug.

At 11:31 p.m., he tweets "Going well, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!"

Day 2: Saturday, Oct. 3

At Walter Reed, Trump's oxygen level falls again. He is given dexamethasone, a steroid used to reduce inflammation, and a second dose of remdesivir.

Conley, in the Sunday news conference, says he doesn't know if Trump received another round of supplemental oxygen on Saturday.

Conley says on Saturday that Trump is doing "very well." However, Mark Meadows, White House chief of staff, tells reporters that Trump's vital signs were "very worrying." He says the next 48 hours will be critical.

At 1:19 p.m., Trump praises Walter Reed medical staff in a tweet and says "With their help, I am feeling well!"

At 6:51 p.m., Trump tweets a four-minute video in which he says "I'll be back, I think I'll be back soon...I'm doing well. I think we're going to have a very good result."

Day 3: Sunday, Oct. 4

On Sunday morning, Conley said the president is improving.

At 5:16 p.m., Trump announces on Twitter that "I'm about to make a little surprise visit" to dozens of supporters outside Walter Reed hospital.

He then unexpectedly leaves the hospital in a motorcade and waves to people from inside a Secret Service SUV. Medical experts criticize the president for putting security personnel at risk for infection.

Trump receives a third dose of remdesivir.

Day 4: Monday, Oct. 5

At 10:45 a.m., Melania Trump tweets "I am feeling good and will continue to rest at home."

At 2:37 p.m., Trump tweets "I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 p.m. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life."

At a 3 p.m. news conference, medical officials say Trump has continued to improve and confirm he will be released. "Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet," Conley says, the president will be surrounded by world-class medical care 24-7.

Dr. Brian Garibaldi, a pulmonary physician, says Trump will get a fourth dose of remdesivir before leaving Walter Reed and a fifth dose at the White House on Tuesday evening.

"There is no evidence of live virus still present that he could possibly transmit to others," Conley says.

The president returned to the White House shortly before 7 p.m. It was unclear if Trump would confine himself to the White House residence or work out of the West Wing, where other staffers have reported testing positive for COVID-19.

Day 5: Tuesday, Oct. 6

The president "continues to do extremely well" according to a note released by Conley on Oct. 6. "He had a restful first night at home, and today he reports no symptoms."

Trump’s appearance at a Make America Great Again event in Flagstaff, Arizona, was canceled and no other public events were scheduled. It was still unclear whether Trump was isolated in the White House residence or working from the West Wing.

Twitter flagged a morning Trump tweet – this one comparing COVID-19 to the flu – as misleading and possibly hurtful information, but kept the tweet publicly accessible.

Later in the day, Trump tweeted he was halting negotiations between administration officials and House Democrats for the coronavirus relief bill. That evening, the president said he wanted the House and Senate to approve aid for the struggling airline industry and small businesses and tweeted his support for stimulus checks.

Day 6: Wednesday, Oct. 7

Trump had no events scheduled Wednesday. Shortly after 2 p.m., the White House released a medical update from Conley that said the president had “now been fever-free for more than 4 days, symptom-free for over 24 hours, and has not needed nor received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization.”

Conley also said medical tests showed the presence of antibodies the human body uses to fight the coronavirus.

The president remained active on Twitter, many of his posts aimed at the election. Twitter flagged, but did not remove, one of his tweets that said Democratic-run ballot systems are corrupt, directing viewers to a Twitter fact-checking site that said voting by mail is legal and safe.

Day 7: Thursday, Oct. 8

Trump said he would not participate in the next presidential debate with Biden, a virtual town hall scheduled for Oct. 15. "I'm not going to waste my time in a virtual debate," Trump said in a Fox Business interview Thursday morning. His campaign team suggested the second debate be delayed until Oct. 22.

Conley issued his third medical update on the president late Thursday, saying Trump's "physical exam has remained stable and devoid of any indications to suggest progression of illness" and said he anticipated Trump's "safe return to public engagements" on Saturday, the 10th day since the initial diagnosis.

The president was active on Twitter, tweeting mostly about the upcoming election and political rivals. He released two videos, one touting his improvements for the military, the other on the coronavirus, promising medicine on an expedited basis for COVID-19.

Day 8: Friday, Oct. 9

Trump remained at the White House but said he planned to address an outdoor rally at the White House on Saturday. He also said he would travel Monday to an evening rally in Sanford, Florida.

The president tweeted audio clips of some of his conversation with conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh.

The next they were learning that those few students who had already been allowed back in person were being sent back home.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I am heartbroken that today we have to close our doors to our highest-need students,&#8221; Boston&#8217;s schools superintendent, Brenda Cassellius, said Wednesday. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was a microcosm of the disarray across the country as school districts try to get back to normal &#8212; or at least something vaguely resembling it.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In suspending their attempt to resume in-person learning in public schools, Boston officials cited the city&#8217;s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/massachusetts-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">rising tide of coronavirus cases</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">After starting the school year remotely for all students last month, the city began a phased reopening on Oct. 1, allowing about 3,000 high-needs students to attend in-person classes at least two days a week. Those students include some with disabilities, as well as those who have experienced homelessness and those who are still learning English.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The next phase, which would have brought back kindergartners and pre-kindergarteners, had been scheduled for as soon as mid-October, but was recently delayed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For now, all that is over &#8212; at least, in Boston.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Elsewhere in the country, more large districts are beginning to open schools, reassured by the fact that there is not clear evidence at this point of significant transmission in schools, especially among younger children.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In North Carolina, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools welcomed prekindergarten students back to classrooms last week and plans to bring in other students in phases over the coming weeks and months.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The San Diego Unified School District, the second-largest district in California, last week brought back students identified as needing in-person instruction or services.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Texas, dozens of school districts are not just offering in-person instruction again, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/21/texas-schools-remote-in-person-learning/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they are requiring it</a>, to the concern of some parents.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In New York City, after reopening schools for in-person learning, officials began closing some in neighborhoods where cases were flaring up.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And in Los Angeles, the largest district in California and the second largest in the country, there is still no date set for a return to class because it has not yet met the standards set by the state for opening schools. San Francisco has met those standards &#8212; but the superintendent has said that schools will not be ready to open until 2021.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Boston&#8217;s decision to walk back its plans came after the city&#8217;s seven-day average positivity rate for coronavirus testing increased to 5.7 percent.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The city said that it would welcome back high-needs students when the positivity rate declined to 5 percent or below for two consecutive weeks, and that it would begin the phased return of other students when it declined to 4 percent or below for two consecutive weeks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Cassellius, the schools superintendent, urged the community to comply with public health guidance to bring the infection rate down. &#8220;We need your help,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our children are depending on all of us.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Experts said that closing schools might have been the right decision, but questioned why the city was not closing anything else.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Why would you ever have restaurants open for indoor dining while you&#8217;re closing schools? It&#8217;s wrong on so many levels,&#8221; said Dr. Benjamin P. Linas, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The evidence now is that restaurants drive transmission and schools do not,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler and assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, criticized the city for delaying the opening of schools for most students until late October, given that many epidemiologists had predicted a surge in cases as the weather cooled.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We&#8217;ve squandered the opportunity to have kids in school and feel comfortable about it by delaying school until the end of October,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just so mad.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-taylor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="njs-governor-philip-murphy-is-quarantining-two-members-of-his-senior-staff-have-tested-positive"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#njs-governor-philip-murphy-is-quarantining-two-members-of-his-senior-staff-have-tested-positive">N.J.&#8217;s governor, Philip Murphy, is quarantining.

Murray/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The coronavirus reached into the upper levels of New Jersey&#8217;s government on Wednesday: Two members of Gov. Philip D. Murphy&#8217;s senior staff tested positive and the governor announced that he would quarantine himself through the end of the weekend after recently being exposed to at least one of them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Murphy made the abrupt announcement about his quarantine in the middle of a news conference, saying he had learned just minutes before about one of the staff members&#8217; positive test results. The governor said he had been in &#8220;close proximity&#8221; to that staff member on Saturday before the individual tested positive, adding that he had not experienced any symptoms of Covid-19.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Murphy tested negative for the virus on Monday and Wednesday, according to a statement from his office that did not specify the kind of tests he took. The statement also said that both Mr. Murphy and his wife, Tammy Murphy, would cancel their in-person events and quarantine through the end of the weekend and take another test &#8220;before they resume any in-person engagements.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/health/coronavirus-testing-negative.html" title="">The negative virus test results</a> so far do not rule out the possibility that Mr. Murphy was infected, as levels of the virus<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/health/coronavirus-superspreading-contagion.html" title=""> can take days</a> to build in the body. Symptoms of Covid-19 may take up to 14 days to appear.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The staff member who Mr. Murphy was exposed to on Saturday was his deputy chief of staff for intergovernmental affairs, Mike DeLamater, according to Michael Zhadanovsky, a spokesman for the governor. Mr. DeLamater did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We have begun the contact tracing process to notify everyone who may have come into contact with our colleague during the potential infection window,&#8221; Mahen Gunaratna, a spokesman for Mr. Murphy, said in the statement on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Hours after that announcement, the governor&#8217;s office said in another statement that another staff member, Daniel Bryan, senior adviser to the governor for strategic communications, had also tested positive on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Bryan took the test &#8220;out of an abundance of caution,&#8221; the statement said. It added that he had not shown symptoms and that others who might have been exposed, including journalists, would be notified.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Bryan had recently been in contact with Mr. Murphy or Mr. DeLamater. Mr. Bryan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The announcement came as New Jersey, an early center of the pandemic that appeared to have brought the virus under control, is once again seeing a spike in the number of cases. The state over the past week has seen <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">an average of more than 1,000 </a>cases per day, an increase of 49 percent from the average two weeks earlier, according to data compiled through Tuesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Several global leaders have been exposed and some tested positive during the pandemic. Earlier this month, President Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/politics/trump-covid.html" title="">revealed that he</a> had contracted the virus and was subsequently hospitalized with Covid-19. He was just one of an outbreak linked to an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/02/us/politics/trump-contact-tracing-covid.html" title="">event at the Rose Garden</a> that infected <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/08/us/white-house-coronavirus-cdc.html" title="">other White House officials</a>, senators and members of the Republican Party and his campaign. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain was in intensive care in April with the virus and has since returned to work. The leaders of Brazil, Honduras, Guatemala and Bolivia have also contracted the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fox29.com/news/murphy-no-one-should-have-gone-to-trump-fundraiser-at-bedminster-golf-club" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously criticized</a> Mr. Trump&#8217;s decision to hold a fund-raiser at Bedminster, N.J., <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/04/us/trump-covid-symptoms-timeline.html" title="">after a senior Trump aide, Hope Hicks,</a> had tested positive. On Wednesday, Mr. Murphy recalled that criticism after he announced he had been exposed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I can&#8217;t ask President Trump not to come to Bedminster and do a fund-raiser and have me sit here,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mihir-zaveri" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="amtrak-chief-pleads-for-billions-in-aid-and-warns-of-thousands-of-layoffs"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#amtrak-chief-pleads-for-billions-in-aid-and-warns-of-thousands-of-layoffs">Amtrak chief pleads for billions in aid and warns of thousands of layoffs.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="William J.

Flynn said his agency might have to cut an additional 2,400 jobs and divert funding from critical capital projects, such as the multibillion-dollar tunnel between New York and New Jersey &#8212; called the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://nec.amtrak.com/project/the-gateway-program/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gateway program</a> &#8212; and improvements to New York Penn Station.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">His total <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://media.amtrak.com/2020/10/amtrak:-additional-funding-needed-soon-to-avoid-additional-service-and-employment-reductions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">budget request</a> to Congress is $4.9 billion. That includes the rail agency&#8217;s $2 billion standard appropriation.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Flynn urged Senate lawmakers to pass a version of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-passes-updated-heroes-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heroes Act</a>, which cleared the House on Oct. 1 and includes $2.4 billion in emergency funding for Amtrak.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on Amtrak since March. Shortly after the pandemic began in the spring, ridership on the train service plummeted 97 percent. Projected revenue for 2020 has declined by 53 percent, according to Amtrak data.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In response, Congress bailed out the rail network in March with $1 billion in emergency funds. Most of that has been spent, Mr. Flynn said on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As of this month, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/coronavirus-amtrak-furloughs.html" title="">over 2,000 Amtrak workers have been furloughed</a>, representing nearly 10 percent of the agency&#8217;s approximately 20,000-member work force. In September, Mr. Flynn <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/us/politics/coronavirus-amtrak.html" title="">warned House lawmakers</a> that additional cuts to service and the work force would continue in order to &#8220;stave off bankruptcy&#8221; if the rail agency did not receive its requested $4.9 billion.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The rail agency&#8217;s request for more aid is echoed by leaders across the transportation sector. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/coronavirus-public-transit.html" title="">Public transit agencies</a> are requesting $36 billion in addition to the $25 billion received in March. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/coronavirus-school-buses.html" title="">Privately owned school bus and motor coach companies</a> are requesting $15 billion in support.

But three rigorous studies published this week have cast doubt not just on the drug but on the hypothesis underlying its use.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The hypothesis that led to the use of the drug, tocilizumab, for those sickened by the coronavirus made so much sense.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tocilizumab is used for rheumatoid arthritis because it suppresses part of the immune response.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Patients who die from Covid-19 usually have little or no virus left in their bodies. Their immune systems have gotten rid of it. But in doing so, their immune systems went rogue, spewing out powerful compounds &#8212; cytokines &#8212; that fatally damaged tissues and organs in what is known as a cytokine storm.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Prominent among those cytokines is one called interleukin-6, or il-6 &#8212; the very cytokine that tocilizumab blocks. The drug also stops cytokine storms in patients treated with cancer immunotherapies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">So doctors began trying the drug on coronavirus patients, and it was soon considered a standard of care for severely ill Covid-19 patients.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the new studies &#8212; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2772187" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two published Tuesday</a> i<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2772186" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">n JAMA Internal Medicine</a> and one Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine &#8212; found that tocilizumab did not reduce the death rates of Covid-19 patients.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is not clear why the drug failed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Perhaps, wrote Dr. John H.

It&#8217;s not five miles one way, and it&#8217;s not five miles the other way. It&#8217;s only in your area, which allows the economy to continue to run with less disruption. And then we said, we put in place the restrictions. We then watched the data for 14 days. We come back after 14 days, and we make whatever adjustments. The adjustments we&#8217;re going to make are these: to exit a red zone under 3 percent after 10 days, 4 percent in less-populated areas. What does that mean? The virus spreads faster in a denser population than in a more rural population. In a more rural area, you come into effect with &#8212; come into contact and proximity with fewer people than in a denser environment.

Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced on Wednesday that some lockdowns in New York City neighborhoods with rising coronavirus cases <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/nyregion/nyc-reopening-restrictions.html" title="">would be eased</a>, allowing the reopening of schools and businesses that had been shuttered.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But stringent restrictions remained in place for other neighborhoods at the heart of the outbreaks in Brooklyn, as well as for several communities in Rockland and Orange Counties. Another neighborhood, Ozone Park in Queens, was added to the list requiring limitations on activity.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was an acknowledgment that while progress had been made <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/nyregion/cuomo-shutdown-coronavirus.html" title="">during two weeks of lockdowns</a>, targeted restrictions &#8212; which include attendance limitations at mass gatherings and houses of worship &#8212; remained necessary to keep isolated outbreaks from engulfing New York City, a former center of the pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The changes seemed bound to add more confusion over <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/nygovcuomo/status/1313567255247106051?s=21" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the tiered, three-color system of zoned restrictions</a>, a classification that was additionally complicated on Wednesday when the governor unveiled <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/MicroCluster_Metrics_10.21.20_FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new &#8220;microcluster strategy.&#8221;</a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It included a four-region statewide system, and officials said they would consider population and geography along with rates of infection and other factors to determine when areas would enter and exit levels of restrictions.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Regardless of that complexity, the governor insisted that his plan to tackle the state&#8217;s outbreaks was effective.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The governor said that if a neighborhood&#8217;s positivity rate remained under 3 percent after 10 days, the most serious restrictions could be lifted. Less populous areas would have slightly more relaxed standards for lifting the most serious restrictions: under 4 percent over 10 days.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Those &#8220;red zone&#8221; restrictions include closing schools, shuttering nonessential businesses, banning mass gatherings, limiting restaurants to delivery and takeout and restricting houses of worship to 25 percent of capacity or a maximum of 10 people.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But in some cases, the governor said more amorphous considerations would be taken into account, such as whether communities were &#8220;cooperating,&#8221; or whether local governments had engaged in &#8220;effective compliance.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The changes should allow thousands of children in Queens and Brooklyn to return to school as soon as Monday, according to state officials, while some businesses shuttered by the harshest restrictions can reopen as soon as Thursday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that the mayor was &#8220;encouraged by the progress we&#8217;re seeing and will continue our work with the state to drive transmission down.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/nyregion/ny-travel-advisory-states.html" title="">excluded Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut </a>from New York&#8217;s quarantine list, saying there was &#8220;no practical way&#8221; to enforce such a limitation on travelers from those states entering New York. He said on Wednesday that the state was working to see if a different approach to the quarantine rules involving rapid testing was possible.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In New York City, the citywide seven-day average positivity rate was 1.68 percent, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-mckinley" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Jesse McKinley</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/j-david-goodman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">J.

Doug Burgum said in announcing the move that the state needed to reassign 50 National Guard soldiers from contact tracing to help clear a three-day backlog of people who have tested positive but have not yet been notified or assigned to a case investigator.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;In addition, significant community spread of coronavirus and a lack of compliance with close contact investigations have diminished the effectiveness of contact tracing,&#8221; the statement from the governor&#8217;s office said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">North Dakota, which had very few coronavirus cases in the spring and summer and never imposed a mask mandate, is being walloped now by the virus. For weeks, it has reported more new cases than any other state, relative to its population, and its hospitals and public health resources have swiftly come under enormous strain.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Other states have also backed away from contact tracing efforts in the face of major surges in infection, said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;They may be the only one that announced it so overtly,&#8221; Dr. Nuzzo said. &#8220;But this really speaks to the unfortunate truth that when the case numbers get high, it&#8217;s not possible for contact tracers to keep up.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Contact tracing is considered a crucial tool in containing the spread of infectious diseases. But Dr. Nuzzo said the job, which requires a lot of resources, had become significantly harder as states reopened.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the spring, when schools were closed and much of the economy was shut down, each infected individual had only about six contacts that investigators needed to reach. But now, with schools and workplaces reopened and people gathering socially, each new case might require 20 or more calls, she said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On top of that, many people are deeply reluctant to be identified as a contact and go into quarantine, because of the prospect of losing two weeks&#8217; wages and having to scramble for child care and elder care.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;All of these disincentives exist that we have not even begun to try to address,&#8221; Dr. Nuzzo said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The governor&#8217;s office said the suspension of contact tracing was intended to be temporary. The state will still conduct case investigations to identify superspreader events and other specific sources of infection, the statement said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  </p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="no-mouthwash-will-not-save-you-from-the-coronavirus-despite-that-study-going-around"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#no-mouthwash-will-not-save-you-from-the-coronavirus-despite-that-study-going-around">No, mouthwash will not save you from the coronavirus, despite that study going around.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/mouthwashes-could-inactivate-human-coronaviruses-that-cause-the-common-cold-232959144.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rash</a> of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/human-coronaviruses-inactivated-mouthwash-oral-rinses-study" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provocative</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.psu.edu/story/635101/2020/10/19/research/mouthwashes-oral-rinses-may-inactivate-human-coronaviruses" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">headlines</a> this week flooded social media platforms with a tantalizing idea: that mouthwash can &#8220;inactivate&#8221; coronaviruses and help curb their spread.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The idea came from a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26514" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study</a> that found that a coronavirus that causes common colds &#8212; not the one that causes Covid-19 &#8212; could be killed in a laboratory by dousing virus-infected cells with mouthwash. The study&#8217;s authors concluded that the products they tested &#8220;may provide an additional level of protection against&#8221; the new coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But outside experts warned against overinterpreting the study&#8217;s results, which might not have practical relevance to the new coronavirus that has killed more than 220,000 Americans. Not only did the study not investigate this deadly new virus, but it also did not test whether mouthwash affects how viruses spread from person to person.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a problem with using Listerine,&#8221; said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not an antiviral.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The study, which was published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology, looked only at a coronavirus called 229E, which causes common colds &#8212; not the new coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The researchers flooded 229E coronaviruses grown in human liver cells in the lab with several types of mouthwash and nasal rinses for 30 seconds, one minute or two minutes &#8212; longer than the typical swig or spritz into a nose or mouth.

Ms. Pelosi had also conceded that a deal might not be possible before the election. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A nearly one-hour conversation between Ms. Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, brought the pair &#8220;closer to being able to put pen to paper to write legislation,&#8221; a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday afternoon. Separately, Mr. Meadows said that he was &#8220;still very hopeful and very optimistic that we&#8217;re making progress.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But with time waning to cement an agreement, both sides also were wary.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Meadows, who met with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, told reporters that lawmakers in his party had grown suspicious of Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s tactics and were &#8220;starting to get to a point where they believe that she is not negotiating in a fair and equitable manner.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi said she remained upbeat about the prospects for a compromise but allowed for the possibility that it would wait until after the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I&#8217;m optimistic that there will be a bill,&#8221; she said in an interview on MSNBC. &#8220;It&#8217;s a question of, is it in time to pay the November rent, which is my goal, or is it going to be shortly thereafter and retroactive.&#8221;  </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Democrats blocked a move by Republicans to advance a $500 billion plan that would have revived lapsed federal unemployment benefits and a popular federal loan program for small businesses, as well as provide additional money for testing.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats, who have argued the package falls far short of the level of aid needed, unanimously opposed it, and it fell short on a party-line vote of 51-44, failing to clear the 60-vote threshold required to move forward.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Meadows said earlier Wednesday that the toughest obstacles to a bipartisan stimulus deal were a push by Democrats for hundreds of billions of dollars more in federal aid for states and cities and their resistance to a liability shield for businesses. The White House has proposed providing $250 billion to states and municipalities, Mr. Meadows said, while House Democrats have called for double that. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The biggest issue remains state and local assistance,&#8221; Mr. Meadows said on the Fox Business Network. &#8220;That remains a stumbling block.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin are expected to speak again on Thursday. </p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-rappeport" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid4-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-vaccine-trial-volunteer-in-brazil-has-died-but-health-authorities-say-the-vaccine-was-not-to-blame"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-vaccine-trial-volunteer-in-brazil-has-died-but-health-authorities-say-the-vaccine-was-not-to-blame">A vaccine trial volunteer in Brazil has died, but health authorities say the vaccine was not to blame.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A scientist working at a Brazilian pharmaceutical company that is producing an experimental vaccine." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/21virus-briefing-trial2/merlin_178859955_4ea032ab-797b-4aaa-95ed-dbe7b848f809-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A scientist working at a Brazilian pharmaceutical company that is producing an experimental vaccine.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Juan Mabromata/Agence France-Presse &#8212; Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A Brazilian volunteer in a coronavirus vaccine trial run by AstraZeneca died last week, Brazil&#8217;s health regulatory agency disclosed on Wednesday. A Brazilian newspaper, O Globo, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/voluntario-brasileiro-para-vacina-de-oxford-morre-laboratorio-nao-informa-se-ele-recebeu-imunizante-24704301" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that the man had died of Covid-19.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was unclear whether the volunteer received the experimental vaccine or a placebo, but several experts said that if a volunteer had died after receiving the experimental vaccine, the company would have halted the trial to look into safety concerns. Since the trial has not been paused, it is likely that he received a placebo, they said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The trial&#8217;s sponsors &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t have let the trial go straight forward&#8221; if the volunteer had received the vaccine, said Dr. Eric Topol, a clinical trials expert at the Scripps Research Institute. &#8220;That&#8217;s my interpretation.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mark Slifka, a vaccine expert at Oregon Health and Sciences University, agreed. &#8220;If they are saying that this is not a safety concern, then it would seem likely that the death occurred in the placebo group,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The health agency, Anvisa, said that an international safety board monitoring the vaccine study gave notice of the death earlier this week. Gustavo Mendes, a manager at Anvisa, said the agency decided along with its United Kingdom counterpart not to halt the study because an assessment by the independent safety board overseeing it showed the volunteer&#8217;s death was not related to the vaccine.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The death outcome in a Covid-19 clinical study is what we call an expected outcome because Covid can cause death,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Instituto D&#8217;Or, a Brazilian medical research facility that served as a local partner for the study, said in a statement that approximately 8,000 Brazilians have participated in the trial. No safety issues have been reported, the institute said. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">An AstraZeneca spokesman, Brendan McEvoy, said that he could not comment on the case, citing medical confidentiality, but that all required review procedures had been followed. &#8220;These assessments have not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Dr. Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, cautioned against reading too much into the news. &#8220;We cannot be reacting to information that is given in isolation,&#8221; she said. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The news of the death comes just weeks after AstraZeneca <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/health/coronavirus-astrazeneca-vaccine-safety.html" title="">instituted a global halt to its trials</a> after a participant who had received its experimental vaccine fell ill with severe neurological symptoms. The company disclosed few details about the nature of the volunteer&#8217;s sickness, stressing repeatedly that no diagnosis had been confirmed. But within days, AstraZeneca had resumed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/health/astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-resumes.html" title="">several of its trials</a>, having concluded that there was not enough evidence to link the event to their product. American study sites, however, have yet to restart.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Earlier this month, another vaccine front-runner, Johnson and Johnson, also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/world/johnson-johnson-pauses-its-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-because-of-a-volunteers-unexplained-illness.html" title="">paused its trials</a> because of an illness in one of its volunteers. The company has so far not disclosed any details about the sickness.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Details about these pauses often trickled out from anonymous sources, rather than the companies themselves, raising concerns.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;These vaccine companies should know that trust in new vaccines is predicated on the utmost transparency,&#8221; Dr. Topol said. &#8220;I hope AstraZeneca will be more forthcoming.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">According to the O Globo report, the deceased volunteer graduated from medical school at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Last Friday the school&#8217;s student association published a tribute to the physician, quoting a message he posted on social media that described his work treating Covid-19 patients.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The most draining part of working with Covid-19 is certainly having to deal with the suffering, fear and anguish of those who are confined and without close contact with their loved ones,&#8221; the doctor wrote. &#8220;It is almost inevitable to take this weight home when we leave the hospital.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  Manuela Andreoni and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-j--wu" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#big-tens-football-debut-raises-concerns-for-local-mayors">Big Ten&#8217;s football debut raises concerns for local mayors.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Spartan Stadium at Michigan State University last month.

Mayors from many of the areas around the schools&#8217; campuses &#8212; except for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Nebraska and Rutgers University &#8212; signed on.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Many schools responding to the pandemic have asked students to stay inside or have shifted back to remote classes after reports of outbreaks, and some schools or local agencies have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/22/us/college-campus-covid.html" title="">issued punishments to students</a> caught gathering at parties or violating restrictions. Ann Arbor, Mich., home to the University of Michigan, issued an emergency stay-at-home order Tuesday for the college, effective until Nov. 3.

Alabama&#8217;s football program is administering at least 120 screenings a day, Saban suggested on ESPN on Saturday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s inevitable, but when groups like this test a lot, the chances for a situation like this to occur increase,&#8221; said Dr. Sarah Jung, the scientific director of clinical microbiology at Children&#8217;s Hospital Colorado.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Saturday morning, still in isolation hours before second-ranked Alabama was to play third-ranked Georgia, Saban knew the specimen aboard the plane was his diagnostic lifeline to the sideline. If the Mobile lab reported that the sample was negative for the virus, Saban, who had asserted that he had no symptoms and had repeatedly tested negative after his initial result, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/sports/ncaafootball/saban-virus-tests-alabama.html" title="">would be allowed to leave isolation a week early</a> and coach in the prime-time game.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And so it was.

The researchers &#8212; working with Imperial College London and hVivo, a company specializing in such studies, with backing from the British government &#8212; have not said what vaccines they will test.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There are also steep limits to what scientists can learn about real-world transmission from exposing people in secure isolation units. Does a vaccine that protects healthy, younger volunteers &#8212; the only group eligible for deliberate infection &#8212; also help the people most endangered by the coronavirus, older adults or people with pre-existing conditions?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And is dripping virus into a volunteer&#8217;s nose anything like the exposure people receive at work or in their homes?</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Is it breathed out, sneezed out, do you sniff it all in one fell chunk of virus coming at you?&#8221; said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. &#8220;No one really knows. It&#8217;s so hard to model.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For now, scientists overseeing the trial, scheduled to begin in January, said they would use <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/health/coronavirus-remdesivir-who.html" title="">the antiviral medicine remdesivir</a> to treat volunteers before the onset of symptoms.

The mismanagement of the scheme is widely regarded to have led to a second wave of the virus in Victoria. The outbreak put Melbourne, which is in the state of Victoria and is the second-largest city in Australia, into lockdown for over three months.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Monday, the authorities said that blood glucose monitoring devices intended for use by one person were used on multiple guests held in the hotels between March and August.

At that point most countries locked down, stopping movement and much interpersonal contact. Strategies have changed, and today local lockdowns are the way forward for most. There is more testing, giving a clearer picture of the pandemic. But the numbers continue to grow.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Over the past week in the United States, there have been 421,114 new cases, illustrating that the long-predicted fall wave of the virus is well underway.  Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states are struggling to control major outbreaks. And <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/coronavirus-cases-rise.html" title="">the national trajectory is worsening by the day</a>, as the cooler weather drives more people to stay indoors where the virus spreads easily. In some states, hospitals are almost full.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">India reported 411,718 over the past seven days, but numbers have been falling since mid-September. On Monday, the country recorded fewer than 50,000 cases, the lowest number since July, the government said. But the lower numbers, which would seem at first glance to be good news, have raised questions. The government recently approved the use of rapid coronavirus testing based on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53609404" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gene-editing technology</a>, hoping to increase its testing capabilities. But experts question the reliability of rapid tests. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In France, which has added 174,273 cases in the past seven days, a curfew has been implemented in Paris and eight other regions. Still, more than 11,000 virus patients are hospitalized, and 2,000 are in intensive care, a threshold that had not been reached since May. (The country currently has 5,800 intensive care beds.) </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Brazil, which has reported 160,326 cases in the past seven days, is among the countries with the lowest testing rates and still lacks a clear contact tracing policy. Despite being the country with the second-highest death toll, about eight million Brazilians had received laboratory tests by mid-October, according to the Ministry of Health, less than a tenth of the number of people tested in the United States.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But, as in India, the disease has been trending downward in Brazil since early August. The country is now reporting an average of 500 deaths a day, half of the daily toll it reported two months ago. Most big cities have eased social-distancing measures and opened some schools, restaurants, and beaches.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The number of daily recorded infections in the United Kingdom has nearly tripled since the beginning of October. In the past seven days, the U.K. has reported 127,622 new cases. Hospitalizations and deaths are also rising, and in some parts of the country, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/18/revealed-some-manchester-area-hospitals-already-full" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intensive care units are being stretched</a> to their limits. The countries that make up the U.K. are each forging their own paths: England has implemented a tiered alert system; Northern Ireland is ramping up restrictions for pubs and restaurants, and closing schools; Scotland implemented a two-week tightening of restrictions; and Wales was preparing to enter a two-week national lockdown.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Russia has added 103,992 new cases in the past seven days.. The government, however, has resisted imposing even local lockdowns, although it has started to enforce mask-wearing requirements The capital, Moscow, is recording about one-third of the country&#8217;s daily new cases. Health authorities there have opened temporary hospitals in a city park and in a large car-dealership center.  But Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said curfews and business closings are &#8220;absolutely unacceptable and impossible for us.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Argentina has reported 101,964 cases in the past seven days. It is the fifth country to surpass one million total cases.  The country received praise early in the pandemic for imposing a strict quarantine in mid-March, and although certain restrictions have been relaxed, much of the country is still under some type of lockdown order. Still, the virus, which was once concentrated in the Buenos Aires area, has since expanded to much of the country, including remote areas with scarce medical resources.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  Kaly Soto, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eileen-sullivan" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Eileen Sullivan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sameer-yasir" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sameer Yasir</a>, Antonella Francini, Manuela Andreoni, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anna-schaverien" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Anna Schaverien</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anton-troianovski" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Anton Troianovski</a> and </p><p class="css-608m5d" id="thailand-welcomes-its-first-foreign-tourists-in-months"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#thailand-welcomes-its-first-foreign-tourists-in-months">Thailand welcomes its first foreign tourists in months.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Chinese tourists arriving in Bangkok on Tuesday from Shanghai." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/world/21virus-briefing-thailand-1/merlin_178796496_e09e6647-d69d-4f75-a5dc-9ca6065cbb77-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Chinese tourists arriving in Bangkok on Tuesday from Shanghai.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Wason Wanichakorn/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Thailand welcomed more than 10 million tourists from China last year.

Officials have been trying for months to bring back tourists through a special visa and quarantine program and, after several false starts, the group of 39 arrived from Shanghai on Tuesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The travelers went directly into quarantine at a Bangkok hotel, where they will remain for 14 days at their own expense.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, said in an interview on Wednesday that he hopes the group&#8217;s arrival will open the door to travelers from other low-risk countries, such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.

But officials had also done <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html" title="">more testing than almost every other state</a> and then tracked every person who came back positive with an army of contact tracers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Now, as temperatures begin dipping back below freezing, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/coronavirus-cold-weather-winter-alaska.html" title="">the virus has seized new opportunities</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Alaska&#8217;s struggles provide an early warning that winter could bring the most devastating phase of the pandemic. On Friday, the weekly case average in the state <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/alaska-coronavirus-cases.html" title="">reached its highest point of the year</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Along with cold-season gatherings moving into more confined spaces, there is evidence that the coronavirus is more virulent in colder weather and lower relative humidities.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The state also faces some particular challenges, with officials fearing outbreaks in remote villages. Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska&#8217;s chief medical officer, described one small community with no running water that is currently dealing with an outbreak, and weather has prevented officials from getting supplies in.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">One of the challenges that Dr. Zink has consistently faced is convincing residents to wear masks and stay distanced. In May, when Gov. Mike Dunleavy lifted statewide restrictions, he left decisions about how to manage the pandemic to local jurisdictions.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In the town of Wasilla over the weekend, people gathered at a bar for an Oktoberfest celebration. While the outdoor seating offered views of snow-capped mountains, the weather was near freezing, so people crowded inside, where no one was wearing masks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And at a youth hockey tournament this month in Anchorage, videos showed some parents watching from the stands without masks. When the tournament was over, the Anchorage Health Department announced it was investigating a &#8220;cluster&#8221; of cases linked to the games.</p><p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In other developments around the United States:</p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The National Cherry Blossom Festival&#8217;s parade</strong> &#8212; held annually in Washington, D.C., during March or April and often considered the first sign of spring in the region &#8212; has been canceled for 2021 because of virus concerns. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/parade-cancellation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The organization that runs the event</a> said plans for the festival will proceed &#8220;but with changes due to ongoing restrictions caused by Covid-19.&#8221;</p></li></ul><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-baker" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="with-coronavirus-cases-sharply-rising-some-new-yorkers-are-already-stockpiling-supplies"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#with-coronavirus-cases-sharply-rising-some-new-yorkers-are-already-stockpiling-supplies">With coronavirus cases sharply rising, some New Yorkers are already stockpiling supplies.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Grand Central Terminal in New York City on Monday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/world/21virus-briefing-newyork-1/21virus-briefing-newyork-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Grand Central Terminal in New York City on Monday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Timothy A.

Andrew M. Cuomo to order lockdowns in several parts of Brooklyn and Queens where the rate of positive test results has risen most sharply. The restrictions mostly affected neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations. But other neighborhoods faced partial lockdowns, including the canceling of indoor dining. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo announced <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/21/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates/cuomo-will-ease-restrictions-in-some-nyc-virus-hot-spots" title="">that restrictions would be eased in some hot spots in New York City</a>, while rules would be tightened in other areas.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The increases have rattled many people in those neighborhoods and beyond, reminding them of the dark days of March and April when it was impossible to meet friends, eat out at a restaurant, go to church or visit parents. Some residents are back to stockpiling medicine and rubbing alcohol, while others are putting their plans to return to their offices on indefinite hold.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Some New Yorkers see the rise in cases as a harbinger, the footfalls that announce an intruder&#8217;s arrival.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I feel like the second wave is here &#8212; that same kind of doomsday feeling,&#8221; said Anya Ferring, 40, a fashion production consultant who lives in Far Rockaway, Queens, one of the neighborhoods experiencing a partial lockdown.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In several interviews in the past several weeks, city residents shared deep frustrations with their fellow New Yorkers who don&#8217;t appear to be following the same rules on wearing masks and social distancing. The solidarity forged in the springtime outbreak appears, in some neighborhoods, to have fractured in the fall.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Zoe Neuschatz, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, said she and her boyfriend have been mostly staying at home since the pandemic began, and they have no plans of letting up and have even considered stockpiling supplies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s my post-trauma stress from the spring,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a nerd about it.

They came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, telling Democrats that their latest conversation had yielded &#8220;common ground as we move closer to an agreement.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The cost of their emerging compromise on a new round of aid to hard-pressed Americans and businesses has steadily climbed toward $2 trillion, inching closer to Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s demands even as it far exceeds what most Senate Republicans have said they can accept.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With coronavirus cases <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">continuing to rise</a> across the country and tens of millions of American families and businesses going without critical federal benefits they relied on for much of the year, economists and the chair of the Federal Reserve have said now is the time for a substantial infusion of federal money to fuel a still-shaky economic recovery.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A majority of voters agree, saying <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/biden-trump-times-poll.html" title="">they would support a $2 trillion stimulus package</a>. And Mr. Trump, who only two weeks ago scuttled the bipartisan talks, is now also pushing urgently for Congress to &#8220;go big,&#8221; as he grasps for political advantage in the waning days of his re-election race.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The latest White House offer would cost nearly $1.9 trillion, White House officials said, nearly four times the size of the $500 billion package that Senate Republicans hoped to advance on Wednesday in a bid to show voters that they were willing to provide some aid &#8212; just not what Democrats and Mr. Trump have been discussing. (Democrats were likely to object to the package as inadequate and prevent it from clearing the 60-vote threshold it would need to advance.)</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="promising-antibody-treatments-will-be-in-short-supply"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#promising-antibody-treatments-will-be-in-short-supply">Promising antibody treatments will be in short supply.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="An antibody trial site for Regeneron and Eli Lilly treatments in Mesa, Ariz., in August." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/world/21virus-briefing-regeneron-1/merlin_175679439_17bb3604-f767-47c0-ae8b-c34412d78d4f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">An antibody trial site for Regeneron and Eli Lilly treatments in Mesa, Ariz., in August.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Nearly two weeks ago, President Trump told Americans that they would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/us/trump-video-blessing-from-god.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">soon be getting</a> an antibody treatment that he had promoted, without evidence, as a &#8220;cure&#8221; for the coronavirus. Last weekend, as the country braced for another major wave of coronavirus infections, Mr. Trump&#8217;s health secretary <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-october-18-2020-n1243845" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promised such therapies</a> were just around the corner.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But these statements are misleading, at best. Even if the drugs are proven to work &#8212; still a big if &#8212; there&#8217;s little chance that they will soon be widely available. A smooth distribution of the antibody treatments will be dependent on the very same factors that have so far bedeviled the country&#8217;s response to Covid-19: fast and plentiful testing, coordination between state and federal officials, and equitable access to health care.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Supply will be extremely limited at first, even though the pool of patients who might benefit is vast, raising messy questions about who should be first in line for treatment. The drugs are believed to work best in people who have recently been infected and are not yet very sick.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Roughly 60,000 Americans are testing positive for the coronavirus every day, yet the company that provided the president&#8217;s antibody treatment, Regeneron, has said it will have only 50,000 doses initially. Eli Lilly, which is developing a similar product, has said it will have 100,000 doses at first. Regeneron will eventually have 300,000 doses, and Eli Lilly will have up to one million before the end of the year. Both companies have applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of their products.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-thomas" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid4-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid4"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="cathay-pacific-cuts-jobs"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#cathay-pacific-cuts-jobs">Cathay Pacific slashes 8,500 jobs as it struggles with the pandemic and politics.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon passenger jets parked on the tarmac at Hong Kong International Airport this month." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/20/world/20markets-brf-cathay-1/merlin_178782102_88f37b44-5a95-4770-b16e-7d615c93df01-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon passenger jets parked on the tarmac at Hong Kong International Airport this month.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Anthony Wallace/Agence France-Presse &#8212; Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong&#8217;s major airline, on Wednesday said it would slash thousands of jobs and scrap its subsidiary carrier, Cathay Dragon, in a major restructuring intended to cope with the continued impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the airline industry.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">About 8,500 jobs, or 24 percent of the company&#8217;s head count, would be cut under the new plan. Of those, about 5,300 Hong Kong employees would be laid off. Executives would also take pay cuts, and company will also suspend salary raises next year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The global pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on aviation and the hard truth is we must fundamentally restructure the group to survive,&#8221; Augustus Tang, the chief executive of the company said in a statement.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We have to do this to protect as many jobs as possible,&#8221; he said, adding that the company had already scaled back capacity, frozen recruitment and cut executives&#8217; salaries, but was still burning up to about $260 million monthly.

The tally includes not only deaths directly caused by the coronavirus but also nearly 100,000 fatalities that are indirectly related but would not have occurred if not for the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm?s_cid=mm6942e2_w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The study</a> is an attempt to measure excess deaths &#8212; fatalities from all causes that statistically exceed those normally occurring in a certain time period.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Many experts believe this measure tracks the pandemic&#8217;s impact more accurately than the case fatality rate. The figure includes deaths from Covid-19 that were misclassified or missed and deaths from emergencies like heart attacks that went untreated because people were afraid to go to the hospital.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Hidden in the new numbers from the C.D.C. is a statistic that may not mean as much as it appears: While the pandemic has taken the greatest toll on older citizens, the biggest percentage increase in excess deaths has occurred among young adults ages 25 to 44, among whom there was a 26.5 percent increase &#8212; as compared with an increase of 14.4 percent in those over 85, a group with a large proportion of the nation&#8217;s excess deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But in nonpandemic times, the death rate among people in that age group is very low, so a disaster such as Covid-19 can easily bump up their death statistics without adding up to large numbers of excess deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Excess deaths among Black people and Hispanics of all age groups also rose compared with previous years, the C.D.C. reports. Hispanics experienced a 54 percent increase, while Black people saw a 33 percent rise.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">By comparison, the increase for white Americans was 12 percent, according to the C.D.C.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/19/2014279117" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Another report,</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that in April nearly half of the nation&#8217;s excess deaths were in New York and New Jersey. A third were in people over age 85.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But excess deaths are only part of the story, noted the authors of that paper, led by Amy Finkelstein, a professor of economics at M.I.T. While deaths last spring were concentrated in New York and New Jersey, the economic ravages from the pandemic extended nationwide, even in states with almost no deaths.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Job losses in New York and New Jersey were just a small fraction &#8212; 7 percent &#8212; of job losses throughout the country. And while deaths were concentrated in older people, half of those who lost their jobs nationwide were ages 25 to 44.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Concentrating on case counts or death counts, they conclude, provides only a partial picture of the pandemic&#8217;s devastation.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Health crises concentrated in one part of the country and one age group may have substantial economic spillovers that are felt throughout the rest of the country and on other age groups,&#8221; the authors wrote.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Roni Caryn Rabin</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-cwx7ji etfikam0">Reporting was contributed by Monika Pronczuk, Anna Schaverien and Eileen Sullivan.</p><p></p></div>

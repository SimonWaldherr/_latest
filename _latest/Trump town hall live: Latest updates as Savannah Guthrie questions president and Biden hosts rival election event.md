US president Donald Trump in Iowa on Wednesday

Donald Trump and Joe Biden began their dueling town hall appearances on what should have been the night of the second presidential debate.

Trump is appearing on NBC at the same time that Biden is appearing on ABC after the Commission on Presidential Debates unilaterally changed the format to a virtual town hall due to the president's Covid diagnosis, with both campaigns unable to reach an agreement to move forward.

On the same day that the presidential candidates should have clashed, would-be moderator Steve Scully was suspended by his employer C-Span after seeking advice from an anti-Trump activist and lying about it when confronted.

Instead, Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of NBC News’s “Today” show, is hosting the Trump town hall while ABC News' chief anchor, George Stephanopoulos, is hosting Biden.

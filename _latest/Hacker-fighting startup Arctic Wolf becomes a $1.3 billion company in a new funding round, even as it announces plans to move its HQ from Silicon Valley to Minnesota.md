<p>With a new $200 million funding round, a $1.3 billion valuation, and skyrocketing revenue growth in an area Gartner says is blowing up, Arctic Wolf is the very essence of a booming tech startup.</p><p>But here's where it's a bit of a lone wolf: The firm is tracking mid-size companies instead of the huge corporate clients many enterprise software startups try to land and that trail is leading it away from from its home Silicon Valley to a new company headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minnesota.&#160;</p><p>Brian NeSmith, CEO and cofounder of Arctic Wolf, says the new Series E funding round &#8212; announced Thursday and led by Viking Global Investors&#160; &#8212; will let his 8-year-old, 550-person firm continue the growth that helped it double its subscription revenue over the past year.&#160;</p><p>The firm helps mid-size companies monitor their networks and respond to threats, providing key backup to customers overwhelmed by the intricacies of cybersecurity in the remote work era.&#160;</p><p>

</p><p>The new $200 million round, which carried a $1.3 billion valuation, follows a $60 million Series D in March, and brings the firm's total fundraising to $378 million.&#160;</p><p>"We just see an amazing opportunity," says NeSmith. "So raising a larger round not that far away from the previous round was really around more aggressive expansion."</p><p>Alongside the new funding, Arctic Wolf is relocating its global headquarters from Silicon Valley to an environment suiting its atmospheric name. Arctic Wolf plans to add 150 jobs to its Eden Prairie location &#8212; a&#160;suburb of Minneapolis where it already had a satellite office &#8212; which will include a new security operations center facility to help monitor customers' networks.</p><p>Nick Schneider, Arctic Wolf's chief revenue officer, cites the Minneapolis area's "central location and a favorable business environment" as reasons for the move. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-offices-post-coronavirus-hub-spokes-satellite-model-experts-2020-9">Tech companies are increasingly moving</a> from large Silicon Valley campuses to distributed workforces in more affordable areas.&#160;</p>

<p>"We're now a Silicon Valley company not based in Silicon Valley," NeSmith says. "We felt like we could build out a location outside the valley that would be more economical, that would be more attractive."</p><p>Arctic Wolf acts as an extension of an organization's security team, detecting and responding to threats to its networks, which have expanded to include employees' homes. By 2025, half of all businesses will be using services like Arctic Wolf to spring into action when there is a cyberattack, <a href="https://cybersecurity.arcticwolf.com/Gartner-MDR-Guide-2020.html">according to Gartner,</a> which calls this area of cybersecurity managed threat detection and response.&#160;</p><p>The startup also helps companies manage what can be an overwhelming number of cybersecurity tools. As cybersecurity has become increasingly complex, medium-sized companies need help, NeSmith says.</p><p>"The rapid growth of Arctic Wolf is being driven by organizations realizing that they don't have a 'tools problem,' but an operational one &#8212; and that they can't solve their security operations challenges on their own," he said. "More and more of what I would call mid-size enterprise companies of 5,000 to 10,000 employees are starting to realize that maybe this isn't really our core competency and they might want to look for more of an expert."&#160;</p><p>Indeed, Arctic Wolf investor DTCP, which took part in the new round, was impressed with the firm's growth, partially spurred by the coronavirus crisis: "We have seen businesses struggle with maintaining their cybersecurity posture as remote work has increased," says Lance Matthews, a principal at the venture capital firm.</p><p>An IPO is probably ahead, but not in the immediate future, NeSmith says: "We're probably looking six to eight quarters out. There are no guarantees, but we think we're in a good position to be one of the big IPOs."</p>

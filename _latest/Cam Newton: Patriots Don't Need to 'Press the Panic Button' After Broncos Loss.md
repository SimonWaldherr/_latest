  Cam Newton: Patriots Don't Need to 'Press the Panic Button' After Broncos Loss 
description: > 
  Steven Senne/Associated PressThe New England Patriots fell to 2-3 after Sunday's 18-12 loss to the Denver Broncos, but quarterback Cam Newton still feels confident in the team."There's no need to press the panic button," Newton told WEEI on Monday (h/t Mike Reiss of ESPN).He was clearly rusty in Sunday's loss, throwing two interceptions while producing just a 51.6 quarterback rating.Despite the loss, New England could be better than the current record indicates.If Newton can shake off the rust and get back on track with his receivers, the Patriots can remain contenders in the AFC East.

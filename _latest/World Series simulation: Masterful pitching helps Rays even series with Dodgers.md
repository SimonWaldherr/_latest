Using the&#160;<a href="http://www.dynastyleaguebaseball.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Dynasty League Baseball&#160;online simulation</a>, USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner and DLB designer Mike Cieslinski will pre-play each game to provide some insight into the key matchups and strategy fans can expect to see in the Fall Classic. (Last year's Sim Series had the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/fantasy/2019/10/30/world-series-simulation-juan-soto-nationals-astros-game-7-thriller/2505291001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Nationals defeating the Astros in 7 games</a>.)</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Game 2: Tampa Bay Rays vs. Los Angeles Dodgers</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Blake Snell allowed one hit through 6 2/3 innings and Joey Wendle's two-run single in the eighth propelled the Tampa Bay Rays past the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2 in Game 2 of USA TODAY's annual Simulated World Series.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Rays evened the series by yielding just two hits in the entire game as relievers Diego Castillo (1-0) and Nick Anderson held L.A. scoreless after Snell exited.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>BOX SCORE:</strong> <a href="https://www.dynastyleaguebaseball.com/GameRecap.aspx?OrgID=126677&amp;GameID=1345bb8a391540d3b2b65a0f65f618f3&amp;ReportType=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Rays 4, Dodgers 2</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>FULL PLAY-BY-PLAY:</strong> <a href="https://www.dynastyleaguebaseball.com/GameRecap.aspx?OrgID=126677&amp;GameID=1345bb8a391540d3b2b65a0f65f618f3&amp;ReportType=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Wendle's clutch hit helps Rays even series</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Dodgers got on the board first in the second inning on back-to-back sacrifice flies by Cody Bellinger and A.J. Pollock. Will Smith's double earlier in the inning was the only hit Snell allowed but it put Max Muncy in position to score the game's first run.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="A screenshot of Austin Meadows' 415-foot solo home run in the sixth inning of Game 2 in USA TODAY Sports' annual Simulated World Series."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Dodgers starting pitcher Tony Gonsolin tossed five shutout innings before allowing a solo home run to Austin Meadows in the sixth. With his pitch count low, Gonsolin continued into the seventh. But he gave up a two-out double to Mike Zunino and before the Dodger bullpen was fully activated, Yandy Diaz delivered a game-tying RBI single. Pedro Baez got the final out, but the damage had already been done.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Rays' winning rally in the eighth was set up when Randy Arozarena singled off Baez (0-1) and stole second. After Mike Brosseau walked and Willy Adames advanced the runners on a ground&#160;out, Wendle greeted reliever Dylan Floro with a sharp single to right that brought both runners home.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Anderson allowed only a Justin Turner single in the ninth in nailing down a two-inning save.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The teams will have an off day before resuming the series with the Rays as the home team in Game 3.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>What to watch in (the actual) Game 2</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>&#8212; Lefty dominance:</strong> The Simulated Series is based on the players' stats from the 2020 regular season, so it shouldn't be surprising to see Snell have a strong outing in Game 2.&#160;Several Dodgers hitters struggled mightily against left-handed pitchers during the season.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Perhaps most mystifying, Mookie Betts hit just .200 with one extra-base hit and two RBI in 64 plate appearances vs. southpaws in 2020. Although Betts hit 16 home runs during the regular season, none of them came against left-handed pitchers.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In addition, Chris Taylor (.200), Cody Bellinger (.216), Kike Hernandez (.217) and Justin Turner (.234) all had subpar batting averages against lefties. Of the five, including Betts, Turner was the only one to manage an OPS above .700.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>&#8212; Speed demons:</strong> The Rays have some excellent (and fast) baserunners, who played important roles in their Game 2 win. Brett Phillips scored the game-tying run in the seventh as a pinch-runner, while&#160;Arozarena had the key stolen base in the eighth and ultimately scored the go-ahead run on Wendle's single.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>&#8212; Bullpen advantage:</strong> The Rays would love to have the game close in the late innings, where their dominant bullpen can overpower the Dodgers hitters. Nick Anderson gave up one earned run in the entire regular season and yielded a .034/.097/.103 slash line to right-handed batters.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Diego Castillo (1.66 ERA), John Curtiss (1.80) and&#160;Pete Fairbanks (2.70) were also dominant out of the bullpen, averaging a strikeout or better per inning.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Game 1 result: Dodgers 5,&#160;Rays 1</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Due to a technical glitch, we were unable to complete the Sim Series opener before the actual Game 1 was played. However, the result&#160;was fairly close to the real thing.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cody Bellinger hit a go-ahead homer to back the strong pitching of Clayton Kershaw as the Dodgers beat the Rays 5-1. Bellinger's blast off Tampa Bay starter Tyler Glasnow was a three-run shot in the fourth inning (as opposed to his two-run blast on Tuesday night).&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Kershaw pitched into the eighth inning of the Sim Series opener, allowing one run on four hits and striking out four to get the win. The only run Kershaw allowed was on a solo homer by Randy Arozarena. (Kershaw yielded one run on two hits over six innings and struck out eight in the actual game. His lone run also came on a solo homer, but by Kevin Kiermaier.)</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>BOX SCORE:</strong> <a href="https://www.dynastyleaguebaseball.com/GameRecap.aspx?OrgID=126677&amp;GameID=154f21e31f654ead9d9438b95d1e82a7&amp;ReportType=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Dodgers 5, Rays 1</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>PLAY-BY-PLAY:</strong> <a href="https://www.dynastyleaguebaseball.com/GameRecap.aspx?OrgID=126677&amp;GameID=154f21e31f654ead9d9438b95d1e82a7&amp;ReportType=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Kershaw, Bellinger lead Dodgers in Game 1</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Simulate your own World Series.

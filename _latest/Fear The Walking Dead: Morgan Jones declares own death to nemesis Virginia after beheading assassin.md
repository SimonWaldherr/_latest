Morgan Jones declared his own death to his nemesis Virginia on Sunday's season six premiere of Fear The Walking Dead on AMC.

The survivor played by British actor Lennie James, 55, was first introduced to viewers during the premiere episode of The Walking Dead in October 2010 and was shot in the upper chest and left for dead by Virginia, portrayed by Colby Minifie, during the season five finale of the companion series.

The season six premiere titled The End Is The Beginning opened with a man spray painting 'THE END' in white on an orange wall.

The next scene showed a man named Walter who stumbled upon Josiah LaRoux, played by Demetrius Grosse, while he was next to a campfire.

Josiah offered Walter some beans while declining to share his recipe and soon a barking dog joined them at the campfire.

'Damn hound's been on my a** since Laredo,' Walter said.

'Good boy, Rufus. Good boy, Rufus,' Josiah said.

Villainous role: Virginia, portrayed by Colby Minifie, during the season five finale of the companion series shot Morgan in the upper chest and left him for dead

'You know his name?,' Walter asked.

'Of course, I do. He's my dog,' Josiah answered before he swung his axe and instantly decapitated Walter.

He retrieved a key hanging from a chain around Walter's neck and then placed his growling zombie head in a box with his first name on it.

Bad shape: Morgan was in bad shape at the start of the season six premiere

Hired hitman: Josiah LaRoux, played by Demetrius Grosse, welcomed Walter when he stumbled into his camping area

Josiah then fielded a radio call from Virginia who offered him a job, but Josiah said it would have to wait until he made a delivery in Galveston.

Virginia offered him a deal to find Morgan and Josiah accepted a lucrative assassination contract.

Morgan meanwhile was in rough shape with bloodshot eyes and suffering from gangrene around his bullet-ridden shoulder.

Bad smell: Morgan was able to walk around zombies because he smelled like death from his wound

His stench of imminent death made him impervious to zombies, yet he still called out to one and fought it off with his staff with just one good arm.

Morgan then climbed up into a water tower that had been converted into living space and wrote its coordinates on his backpack.

He ventured into a deserted small town and retrieved a handgun from a police vehicle, but stumbled and yelled out in pain attracting zombies.

One arm: He still called out to one zombie and fought it off with his staff with just one good arm

Police car: A handgun was retrieved by Morgan from a police car

Water tower: A water tower was converted into living space for Morgan

Isaac armed with a hunting knife killed the attackers and rescued Morgan who revealed while they were holed up in a store that he'd been wounded about six weeks earlier.

Morgan warned him off, but Isaac continued to offer his help nonetheless.

They were interrupted by a distant bark from Rufus as Josiah was on Morgan's trail.

Close call: A man nearly attacked Morgan while he was surrounded by zombies

Helping hand: Issac stepped in to save Morgan

Cool hat: Josiah wore a brown fedora as he killed zombies with his axe

Good dog: Rufus helped track down Morgan for Josiah

Isaac was questioned by Josiah if he'd seen Morgan and he initially denied seeing him, but Rufus sniffed out Morgan's blanket inside the store.

He then convinced Josiah that the blanket was from one of the dead who recently attacked him and the assassin went to look for him.

Josiah found an unconscious Morgan outside and using the coordinates written on his bag took him to the water tower.

Isaac then begged Morgan to use his ability to walk among zombies to take supplies to his pregnant wife Rachel who was about to give birth.

Morgan, who had a psychological breakdown early in the zombie apocalypse, had abandoned his optimistic outlook again and he refused to help Isaac.

Isaac tried to force him to help at gunpoint just as Josiah used his truck to yank down the water tower.

Morgan used his staff to protect Isaac and despite having a clear shot reverted to his non-killing ways and shot Josiah in the arm.

Isaac and Morgan drove off in Josiah's truck and Morgan later revealed that someone stitched him up after Virginia shot him and left a note reading, 'You don’t know me, but I heard your message. You need to do the same. You still have things left to do'.

Morgan learned from Isaac that he used to be one of Ginny's Rangers but preferred the Good Samaritan spirit of Morgan's group.

Nice note: Isaac and Morgan drove off in Josiah's truck and Morgan later revealed that someone stitched him up after Virginia shot him and left a note reading, 'You don’t know me, but I heard your message. You need to do the same. You still have things left to do'

They arrived at the safe place where Rachel was due to give birth and Morgan collapsed again attracting the attention of zombies.

Isaac stepped in to save him and despite only having one arm Morgan rallied and they cleared all of the zombies from the area.

They got to Rachel while she was in labor, but Josiah then closed in on them.

'Even I can smell you from a mile away,' Josiah said.

Knife work: Isaac went to work with his knife and backed up Morgan

Staff blow: Morgan used his staff to destroy the zombies around them

Morgan offered to surrender if Josiah left the others alone and he agreed.

'You won't even feel this,' Josiah said as he approached Morgan with his axe.

Isaac stepped in again and both of them were able to overpower Josiah.

Morgan learned that Isaac recently had been bitten by a zombie before they were attacked again by Josiah.

A fight ensued and Morgan was able to get ahold of Josiah's axe as he gained control.

'You couldn't do it then and you won't do it now,' Josiah taunted him.

Morgan then decapitated him with his own weapon.

Head off: Josiah was decapitated by Morgan who used the assassin's axe against him

Rachel gave birth and Isaac went to meet the newborn as Morgan passed out.

Morgan woke up bandaged with the bullet removed from his shoulder as Rachel her her baby girl nearby.

'We have a daughter. We named her Morgan. It was Isaac's idea,' Rachel said.

New addition: 'We have a daughter. We named her Morgan. It was Isaac's idea,' Rachel said

Morgan then learned that Isaac had died after removing the bullet.

He later traded his staff for Josiah's awesome axe and killed his first zombie with it as Josiah's zombie head gurgled nearby.

An armored SWAT vehicle was then seen stopping as a line of zombies in the road halted a convoy.

Virginia was summoned and approached a box on the road with Morgan Jones written on the lid.

She smiled as she lifted the lid only to find Josiah's head in the box.

Virginia laughed before getting on her radio.

Group leader: Virginia was summoned and approached a box on the road with Morgan Jones written on the lid

Sly smile: A box was left on the road for Virginia and she smiled as the lid read Morgan Jones

Different head: The box actually contained Josiah's growling head

'If you're out there, if you can hear me. I want you to listen and listen good. I thought I needed you to be dead for this to work, but I don't. I just need them to think you are. Which they will. 'Cause if you even try the tiniest bit to convince them otherwise, I will add them to this pile one by one. Do you copy?,' Virginia threatened.

'Morgan Jones is dead. And you are dealing with somebody else now,' Morgan said as he was shown looking at the convoy through binoculars and wearing Josiah's fedora.

The episode ended with the graffiti guy finishing his work reading 'THE END IS THE BEGINNING' on the hull of a submarine as he and another man were apparently waiting for Walter.

Listen up: 'If you're out there, if you can hear me. I want you to listen and listen good. I thought I needed you to be dead for this to work, but I don't,' Virginia said on the radio

Somebody else: 'Morgan Jones is dead. And you are dealing with somebody else now,' Morgan said as he was shown looking at the convoy through binoculars and wearing Josiah's fedora

'We need that key,' the graffiti man said.

His companion said they would have to wait somewhere else as zombies were approaching.

Fear The Walking Dead will return next week on AMC.

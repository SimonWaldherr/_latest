<div><p>Lawyers had argued that the transcripts should remain sealed in part to protect her right to a fair trial</p><p>Transcripts of interviews lawyers conducted with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell" class="u-underline">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> involving her former boyfriend, the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, should be released as soon as possible, a New York judge ordered on Tuesday.</p>
<p>US district judge Loretta Preska signaled that the transcripts of two days of depositions in 2016, during civil litigation, of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/16/who-is-ghislaine-maxwell-robert-maxwell-media-jeffrey-epstein" class="u-underline">British socialite</a> Maxwell, the British socialite and daughter of the late UK media baron, Robert Maxwell, required speedy revelation.</p>
<p>Preska said the depositions and related documents &#8211; along with the deposition transcript of an anonymous accuser &#8211; should be released publicly as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>She gave lawyers an unspecified amount of time to make &#8220;minimal redactions&#8221; to block personally identifiable information that would reveal the names of non-parties or their families.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the second US circuit court of appeals in Manhattan ruled that Preska properly decided that the public had a right to access documents from legal proceedings and that transcripts should be unsealed because arguments by Maxwell&#8217;s lawyers were meritless.</p>
<p>The depositions were taken as part of a civil lawsuit brought against Maxwell by one of Epstein&#8217;s accusers. The lawsuit was eventually settled.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Maxwell, 58, had argued that the documents reflecting seven hours of interviews over two days should remain sealed in part to protect her right to a fair trial in July on criminal charges that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/31/ghislaine-maxwell-underage-girls-sex-jeffrey-epstein" class="u-underline">she helped</a> Epstein traffic and sexually abuse teenage girls in the 1990s.</p>
<p>They noted that portions of the transcripts relate to perjury charges in the indictment she faces. She has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Maxwell has been incarcerated since her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/04/high-society-to-hideaway-arrest-ghislaine-maxwells-dramatic-fall" class="u-underline">arrest in New Hampshire</a> early July. If convicted, she could face up to 35 years in prison.</p>
<p>The arrest came a year after 66-year-old Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking.</p>
<p>He killed himself in August 2019 at a federal jail in Manhattan, where he was awaiting trial.</p>
<p>In 2008 in Florida, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting and procuring a person under age 18 for prostitution.</p>
<p>He spent 13 months in jail, paid settlements to victims and remained a registered sex offender.</p>

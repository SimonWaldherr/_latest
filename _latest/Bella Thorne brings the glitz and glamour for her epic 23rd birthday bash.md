Being the birthday girl, the Shake It Up star undoubtedly stole the show in an eye-catching ensemble.

Bella styled her lengthy auburn hair in voluminous tendrils that flowed down from under a dramatic headdress complete with large hot pink feathers and a pink sequin crown.

She paired the festive headwear with a hot pink satin mini dress that featured various sexy cut outs, puffed sleeves, and a twist front neckline that highlighted her enviable assets.

No party outfit is complete without an excess amount of accessories and Bella made sure to deck out her wrists, neck, and ears in various pieces of glitzy costume jewelry.

In a close-up photo that included her 27-year-old sister Dani, the Midnight sun actress gave her followers a clear view of her ultra glamorous makeup look.

Her eyelids were drenched in neon pink eyeshadow and she had a slew of rhinestones glued onto her cheekbones and all the way up to her forehead.

Aside from partying with her big sister, Bella was also in the company of good pal and rapper Tyga, 30, members of her elite inner circle, and, of course, her handsome beau Benjamin Mascolo.

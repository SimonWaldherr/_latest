Action must be taken to drive this down. </p><p></p><p>&#8220;The post code lottery of access to healthcare practitioners who specialise in endometriosis needs to end. Implementing effective processes within the NHS will help healthcare practitioners support diagnosis and get those with endometriosis symptoms to the right place, in hospitals with the right expertise, at the right time.</p><p>&#8220;Action is needed now, to ensure the next generation with endometriosis are not robbed of the future they deserve&#8221;.</p><p></p><p><i>You can contact the Endometriosis UK helpline on 0808 808 2227.

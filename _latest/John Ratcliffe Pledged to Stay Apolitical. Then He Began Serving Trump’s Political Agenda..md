A spokeswoman for Mr. Ratcliffe declined to comment.

Mr. Trump has made the disclosures a priority as the election nears. He claimed on Thursday that last year he had declassified “everything” related to the Russia investigation, then railed against unnamed officials impeding the release of the information. “There’s not a document they can’t have, but it’s still not that easy,” Mr. Trump told Fox Business Network. “You have a ‘deep state’; you have a group of people that don’t want to have documents shown.”

Some Republicans blamed Ms. Haspel. Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa wrote to her in a letter released on Wednesday that they were “increasingly disappointed” that she had failed to provide them with documents they wanted about the F.B.I.’s 2016 investigation into Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign.

Mr. Ratcliffe, with little warning to the C.I.A., released more material this week, prompting a torrent of complaints from Mr. Trump on Twitter about the Russia investigation and calls for even more releases.

Some of the additional intelligence Mr. Trump, Mr. Nunes and Mr. Ratcliffe want to disclose is contained in secret documents based on the House Republicans’ 2018 report on Russia’s election interference campaign, according to current and former officials.

The report, dismissed by Democrats as distorted, criticized the tradecraft of the intelligence community and said Russia’s goals in 2016 were simply to “sow chaos and discord,” not to favor Mr. Trump. It also raised questions about that intelligence conclusion.

The secret documents contain Republican allegations of wrongdoing by senior officials in the Obama administration, according to a person familiar with the documents. They also have sensitive material about intelligence sources that the C.I.A. relied on to investigate Russia’s interference campaign, as well as material from the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, according to two other people familiar with the outlines of the documents. Republicans believe the information backs their criticism of the handling of the Russia investigation by the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.

The information is so sensitive that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee keep the documents in a lockbox in a vault in C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va. — prompting some intelligence officials to call the lockbox a turducken. Others likened it to a bank safe deposit box.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave a 48-hour deadline on Sunday that she said negotiators must meet to be able to strike a deal on the upcoming coronavirus stimulus package ahead of the November 3 election.

In an interview on ABC's "This Week," the California Democrat said the next two days will be crucial in terms of timing in order for the bill to be signed by President Donald Trump before the presidential election.

With just a little over two weeks to go until the election, the pressure is ramping up to produce a second round of stimulus checks to Americans and small businesses whose finances and economic outlooks were roiled by the coronavirus pandemic.

Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration has made an aggressive push to get out the next stimulus package before the election.

When asked Sunday whether Americans can expect to get a second round of relief within this timeframe, Pelosi said, "Well, that depends on the administration."

"I'm optimistic," she added.

<div><p>President Trump said the US would be in the throes of a &#8220;massive depression&#8221; if he had &#8220;totally&#8221; heeded advice from scientists on coronavirus-related lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Trump made the economic prediction at his <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/trump-attends-church-service-in-las-vegas/">Sunday rally in Carson City, Nevada,</a> adding that the country would endure another Great Depression if Joe Biden is elected president.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gonna lock down. This guy wants to lock down,&#8221; Trump said of Biden, referring to the coronavirus lockdowns for public safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll listen to the scientists. If I listened totally to the scientists, we would right now have a country that would be in a massive depression.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president said that instead, under his watch the US economy is <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/02/jobs-report-us-adds-661000-jobs-unemployment-at-7-9-percent/">recovering from the pandemic.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re like a rocketship. Take a look at the numbers,&#8221; Trump told the crowd.</p>
<p>The US, at nearly 220,000 deaths, has lost more people to the coronavirus than any other country in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery, which we&#8217;re in right now, or a Biden depression,&#8221; the president told the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Depression &#8212; just remember the word,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesperson countered Trump&#8217;s claims, saying the president is to blame for &#8220;tanking&#8221; the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald Trump tanked the strong economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden Administration by continually discounting and attacking warnings from the scientific and medical experts working around the clock to save lives,&#8221; Bates <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-warns-lockdowns-if-biden-elected-scientists-c1263b65-15c9-47a1-9d6b-63161f6c5170.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=onhrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Axios</a> in a statement.</p>

  Sundar Pichai must face up to battle as trustbusters arrive in Silicon Valley

  Certainly, the soft-spoken Mr Pichai, an avid cricket fan and impeccably polite software engineer from the South Indian city of Chennai, seems like an unlikely monopolist.He is about as far removed from the top-hatted John D Rockefeller stereotype as it is possible to be.It runs the gamut from its eponymous search engine to YouTube, mapping and cloud computing services to its Chrome browser.But as the search giant girds itself for battle, Pichai will also be grimly aware that this may be just the start.As the storm clouds gather over Mountain View, there is a growing risk that Mr Pichai and his fellow executives find themselves so engrossed in arcane legal battles that they have little time for much else.

<div><p>Certainly, the soft-spoken Mr Pichai, an avid cricket fan and impeccably polite software engineer from the South Indian city of Chennai, seems like an unlikely monopolist. He is about as far removed from the top-hatted John D Rockefeller stereotype as it is possible to be.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Google has plenty to worry about and Mr Pichai will need to brush up his knowledge of US competition law quickly if he is to see off the threat of a break-up of Google&#8217;s multi-coloured empire.&#160;</p>
<p>It runs the gamut from its eponymous search engine to&#160;YouTube, mapping and cloud computing services to its Chrome browser.</p>
<p>Wisely, the DoJ has focused its case quite narrowly - with Google&#8217;s cosy relationship with Apple, to whom it pays up to $11bn a year to ensure its core search engine remains the default service on iPhones, placed at the core of its legal arguments.</p>
<p>The DoJ claims Mr Pichai met with Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook in 2018 to discuss how they could collaborate to boost growth in search revenues - a meeting which a top Apple executive later followed up on with potentially incriminating language.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is that we work as if we are one company,&#8221; read an email to a Google counterpart.</p>
<p>On its own, this may not be a killer piece of evidence, but it offers a glimpse of the direction the DoJ is taking in what is likely to be a lengthy and highly complex case which could take years.</p>
<p>The DoJ&#8217;s ultimate goal seems to be to reopen the market for Internet search, over which Google holds an overwhelming 90pc control.</p>
<p>With revenues of nearly $80bn in the first half of 2020 alone, Google certainly has the resources to wage legal warfare for as long as it takes.</p>
<p>But as the search giant girds itself for battle, Pichai will also be grimly aware that this may be just the start.</p>
<p>Two separate groups of US state attorneys general are expected to file separate antitrust cases over Google&#8217;s online advertising and search businesses while the US Congress is also examining whether it and other Silicon Valley giants exercise too much power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google is also in the sights of overseas regulators in the UK, EU and Japan.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a genius to realise that the regulatory vacuum in which many big tech companies grew up over the past twenty years is coming to an end.</p>
<p>One way or another, the regulators and the trustbusters are coming.</p>
<p>As the storm clouds gather over Mountain View, there is a growing risk that Mr Pichai and his fellow executives find themselves so engrossed in arcane legal battles that they have little time for much else.</p>

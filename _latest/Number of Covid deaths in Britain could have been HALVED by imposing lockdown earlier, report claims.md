  Number of Covid deaths in Britain could have been HALVED by imposing lockdown earlier, report claims 
description: > 
  Britain's coronavirus death toll could have been halved if ministers had imposed an earlier lockdown, a report has claimed.His calculations — which were published by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research — claimed that 'deaths could have been almost halved by an earlier lockdown'.Looking at the total death toll now, that means between 21,900 and 29,400 deaths could have been avoided, depending on which organisation's death toll is used.Professor Ferguson, dubbed 'Professor Lockdown', was behind the grim modelling which predicted 500,000 people could die if the coronavirus was left unchecked.His calculations revealed: 'If a constant proportion of those admitted die, the implication is that deaths could have been almost halved by an earlier lockdown.'

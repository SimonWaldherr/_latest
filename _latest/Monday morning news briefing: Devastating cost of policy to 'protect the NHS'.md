<h3>'Protect the NHS' message leaves patients paying price <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1ea"> </a></h3>
<p>The devastating cost of efforts to "protect the NHS" in the pandemic has been exposed by a new analysis of 200 health conditions which&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1eb">reveals hospital admissions plummeted by up to 90 per cent</a>. The major report shows that consultations for the most common cancers fell by up to two thirds during lockdown, while heart-attack checks reduced by almost half. Experts said the findings were "staggering" and could mean thousands of extra deaths. Health Editor&#160;<strong>Laura Donnelly</strong>&#160;reveals&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1ec">the devastating cost of the policies</a>&#160;to "protect the NHS", while&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1ed">this graphic shows</a>&#160;how hospital admissions for other conditions plummeted during lockdown.&#160;<strong>Margarette Driscoll</strong>&#160;counts the human cost of lockdown, telling the&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1ee">stories of the patients left ill and dying</a>&#160;as the NHS closed for Covid.&#160;<strong>Linda Blair</strong>&#160;outlines why it has never been more important to speak up about our mental health - and&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1ef">how to get your voice heard</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boris Johnson will attempt to call the bluff of Manchester's leaders today by&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1f0">offering them up to &#163;100 million to accept Tier-3 coronavirus restrictions</a>&#160;or risk having them imposed against their will. Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, described talks with Downing Street on Sunday as "constructive", increasing speculation he might be ready to do a deal. However, the Conservative Party last night&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1f1">descended into fierce infighting</a>&#160;after backbenchers in a string of 'redwall' seats hit out at an "ill-advised" letter sent to Mr Burnham.</p>
<h3>Trump gambles on Nevada as Covid hits Vegas' casinos</h3>
<p>Amid the financial chaos caused by Covid-19, the Republicans could have an opening in the race for the White House. Nevada has voted Democrat in each of the last three presidential elections, but the margins have been getting slimmer every time. Now Donald Trump's campaign team has identified the state as one of a handful, not much covered in the media, which the President narrowly lost in 2016 but could actually flip this year. US Editor&#160;<strong>Ben Riley-Smith</strong>&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1f2">has this dispatch and analysis</a>&#160;of the states being targeted. It comes as it emerged Joe Biden has&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1f3">out-raised and is outspending his rival</a>&#160;by a significant margin, as Trump insiders raise questions about their strategy with two weeks until the vote.</p>
<h3>What's next for Dame Jenni Murray? The Full Monty</h3>
<p>When she quit Woman's Hour, Dame Jenni Murray said it was time to "move on to a new stage". Her first venture in broadcasting after leaving the Radio 4 programme is certainly that. Dame Jenni, 70, is set to strip off for ITV's The Real Full Monty On Ice to boost awareness of cancers affecting "intimate parts of the body". The broadcasting veteran will join a cast of celebrities performing revealing routines in the name of cancer awareness for a two-part special airing this winter.&#160;<a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=h6e7ae9f0,39c9b0a5,36bea1f4">Read on for details</a>.</p>

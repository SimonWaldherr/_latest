Ewan McGregor’s latest motorcycle adventure is an epic ride across 13 countries from Argentina to Los Angeles. Together with presenter Charley Boorman, the Star Wars actor travelled 13,000 miles through America in 100 gruelling days.

Long Way Up is currently screening on Apple TV+ and is the third in a series of global journeys, following Long Way Round and Long Way Down.

This time, however, instead of choosing their more conventional, petrol-powered BMW GS motorbikes, the pair saddled up on the world’s first production electric machine – the Harley-Davidson Livewire.

The aluminium-framed bike only has a range of 95 miles on a cross country run, which made charging the batteries the biggest challenge. Finding a plug in the middle of nowhere proved almost impossible in remote locations like the Bolivian desert and Patagonia.

<div><p>A Los Angeles man was sentenced to more than 75 years in prison after pleading guilty to stabbing his three sons to death in the back of an SUV.</p>
<p>Luiz Fuentes, 38, admitted to killing the children &#8212; Luis, 10, Juan, 9, and Alexander, 8 &#8212; as part of a plea deal that carries a&#160;78-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>At the time of their 2015 death, the boys had been living with their father in an SUV for several months, according to records from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services released to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-fuentes-20151122-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times.</a></p>
<p>On Sept. 9 of that year Fuentes was discovered slumped over in the vehicle while parked in the lot of a furniture warehouse in South Los Angeles. The three boys were found dead in the back seat, while Fuentes was bleeding from what were later determined to be several self-inflicted stab wounds.</p>
<p>The incident represented the brutal end of several years of financial hardship after the boys&#8217; mother died in 2008.</p>
<p>The records also showed reports of abuse from Fuentes, including a 2010 incident in which he beat Luis, then 5 years old, with a belt until he was badly bruised.</p>
<p>Fuentes admitted to a caseworker that he &#8220;made a mistake&#8221; following the incident, but when asked about whether his father hit his brothers, Luis told caseworkers &#8220;He has hit them maybe 2 or 4 or 100 times.&#8221;</p>

A Chicago Bears practice squad player and a strength and conditioning coach for the Kansas City Chiefs have tested positive for COVID-19, according to a Saturday report from ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Schefter did not identify the Chicago player or Kansas City coach but reported that contact tracing was taking place.

Last weekend, Kansas City practice squad quarterback Jordan Ta'amu tested positive; he had been the only known positive case with the team. In the wake of that test, and after New England Patriots QB Cam Newton tested positive for COVID-19, the Chiefs' scheduled game against the Patriots last Sunday was pushed to Monday night, where Kansas City won, 26-10.

This would be the first known positive COVID test among the Bears, who last played Thursday night in a 20-19 victory against the Tampa Bay Bucs in Chicago.

He had a phone with child sexual abuse materials&#160;on it&#160;and graphic plans to carry&#160;out his sexual fantasies with two 11- and 12-year-old girls.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Instead, Craiger&#160;was met on March 18 by undercover law enforcement in a four-month sting that&#160;led to the arrests of&#160;19 men, one woman&#160;and one juvenile male accused of&#160;sexually exploiting children online.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While the world has battled the health and economic effects of the coronavirus, another global issue&#160;has raged in tandem with little notice&#160;&#8212; and&#160;without the additional money and resources needed to effectively battle it, experts said. Online child abuse and exploitation, already one of the biggest and growing&#160;crime challenges nationally, has spiked as COVID-19 has forced more people indoors with abusers and children&#160;spending more time&#160;on the internet.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Lieutenant John Pizzuro, commander of the State Police Internet Crimes Against Children division, poses for a portrait in the Hamilton Technology Center on Thursday, Sept. 24, 2020."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">'People don&#8217;t want to talk about it'</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The increase in reports tracks&#160;in the United States and abroad during the pandemic, experts said. Tips to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the clearinghouse for such information in the United States, nearly doubled&#160;from 6.3 million in the first half of 2019 to 12 million through June of this year. Reports of online enticement similarly spiked during that timeframe, from 6,863 to 13,268.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Online child exploitation right now is probably one of the biggest&#160;problems, from a crime&#160;perspective, in our country,"&#160;Pizzuro said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Many millions of images and videos of children and even newborn babies being raped and abused&#160;&#8212; or of children coerced into performing sex acts on camera&#160;&#8212; constantly ricochet&#160;across the internet. What may begin as seemingly innocent chatting between strangers online can lead to "sextortion," abduction and&#160;human trafficking, according to advocates and law enforcement.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And it is abuse with lifelong effects. Victims are at greater risk of substance&#160;abuse, incarceration, mental health problems and other health issues, according to the abuse prevention nonprofit Darkness To Light. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that compared with other health problems, the cost of child maltreatment like sexual abuse is "substantial"&#160;&#8212; an annual estimated average of $210,000<strong></strong>per child.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Tips for parents:</strong><a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2020/10/21/keeping-kids-safe-online-tips-protect-coronavirus-child-abuse-during-nj-covid/5966928002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">COVID-19 has kids spending more time online&#160;&#8212; and in danger</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Even before the pandemic struck, the sexual abuse and exploitation of children was a growing threat that pervaded every corner of the country.

"And people have to realize&#160;&#8212;&#160;everyone thinks the predator is a guy who is 50 years old and driving a white van selling ice cream. Today's predator is your priest, police officers, daycare workers, firefighters. They are your next door neighbors. And until people really realize that, the problem's going to continue."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Confinement presents opportunities&#160;</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Once states started closing schools and issuing stay-at-home orders to try containing the coronavirus earlier this year, Alicia Kozak thought, "oh no."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Children are going to be home from school, they're going to be home a lot more and they are going to be at great risk. And that happened pretty quickly," said Kozak, who, at the age of 13 in 2002, became the first known child to be abducted by an online predator.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Others had the same reaction as Kozak.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Alicia Kozak, the first known victim to be abducted by an online predator, talks about the epidemic of child exploitation.

Knowing that most abuse happens in the home, she said a rise in cases seemed inevitable.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">At the same time, the lockdown measures have meant fewer opportunities for abuse to be noticed and reported by daycare workers and school teachers, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in an interview.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;The same isolation being used to keep us safe during COVID is being exploited by people who are either abusing a domestic partner or spouse, or a young person in their care," he&#160;said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Previously:</strong><a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/03/23/coronavirus-nj-recipe-disaster-domestic-violence-victims/2876817001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Coronavirus outbreak 'a recipe for disaster' for domestic violence victims</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In addition to investigating tips of online abuse, the task forces routinely set up stings to capture would-be predators. With increased tips of abuse during the pandemic in mind, Grewal's office oversaw "Operation Screen Capture." The <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2020/08/26/child-porn-and-exploitation-sweep-nets-21-nj/3442291001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">five-month sting led to&#160;21 arrests</a>,&#160;including&#160;Craiger, who had really been communicating with undercover officers and not pre-teen girls as he had thought.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But other cases&#160;"show the level of depravity of these predators,"&#160;Jason Molina, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations, said in a statement at the time.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They included&#160;a 40-year-old man from Keansburg, New Jersey,&#160;who allegedly manipulated a 14-year-old girl&#160;into sending him naked pictures of herself engaging in sexual acts, convinced her to carve his initials into her legs, then tricked the girl into revealing her mother&#8217;s phone number and sent those images to her mother. And a 21-year-old babysitter from Newark was&#160;accused of sexually assaulting a "very young child," videotaping&#160;herself performing a sex act on the child and posting it on social media, Grewal's office said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Chronic under-funding</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Protect Our Children Act of 2008 sought to develop a national strategy against online abuse and help the country's 61 Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces. Under the law, Congress&#160;<a href="https://uscode.house.gov/statutes/pl/110/401.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">authorized spending $60 million each year</a> to distribute among those task forces, which are made up of about 4,500 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But no presidential administration has fully&#160;funded the program, according to&#160;Camille Cooper,&#160;vice president of public policy at the&#160;Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network, or RAINN. In fact, the average amount appropriated the past decade is about half what Congress authorized, nearly $29 million, by <a href="https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/programs/internet-crimes-against-children-task-force-program?pi=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">the Department of Justice's own accounting</a>.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That means each task force unit receives between&#160;$500,000 and $600,000 a year, leaving commanders like Pizzuro stretching their dollars for training and equipment for a small staff that works with local, county and federal law enforcement agencies.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A dozen states supplement the&#160;federal funding with a dedicated source of state revenue&#160;through Alicia's Law&#160;&#8212; named for Kozak.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The law has paid dividends in some&#160;states so far.&#160;Wisconsin passed Alicia's Law in 2016, adding $1 million for its internet crime task force. That money helped buy a K-9&#160;&#8212; named Kozak&#160;&#8212; who has sniffed out and located&#160;136 electronic storage devices, 99 of which he found after officers had already searched the scene, according to the Wisconsin attorney general's office. More than 1,000&#160;sexual predators were arrested in two years, according to <a href="https://www.doj.state.wi.us/sites/default/files/news-media/9.18.18_Budget_Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">a 2018 memo</a> from the office.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In Idaho, the addition of $1.6 million a year allowed the state to grow its staff from&#160;four people to 15, plus add forensic examiners and a prosecutor, according to Kozak.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Kozak, now 32 and living in Monmouth County, New Jersey, was groomed online by a man pretending to be&#160;a teenager and abducted after she met him on Jan. 1, 2002. She said he&#160;took her from her hometown of&#160;Pittsburgh to Virginia, where he chained, raped and beat&#160;her&#160;&#8212; and live-streamed it&#160;&#8212; for four days. Someone who recognized her from a missing poster reported it and she was saved.

She is advocating for a law in her name to be passed in New Jersey, as it has in many other states.&#13;Middletown, NJ&#13;Thursday, October 8, 2020 &#13; "><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Kozak&#160;began sharing her story at age 14 and has spent the last several years advocating for the law to help support internet crime task forces. One of the biggest challenges is making political leaders aware of the problem and then convincing them the extra funding is necessary, she said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I've sat in rooms with people, political&#160;leaders,&#160;and you almost want to beg them&#160;because they have the power to make a difference with their signature. They can make such a huge difference, save so many lives, if only they make the choice to," Kozak said.&#160;"There are children right now as we are sitting here who need rescue and they are not getting that rescue,&#160;they are not being saved because of issues related to funding. And that's unacceptable."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Extra state funding could help states increase training and resources, but child sexual abuse materials on the internet are so widespread&#160;that fewer than 10% of detected trading and downloading of the images are investigated, said&#160;Brad Russ, executive director of the <a href="https://ncjtc.fvtc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">National Criminal Justice Training Center</a> at Fox Valley Technical College in Wisconsin, which&#160;provides training and technical support to law enforcement.&#160;Law enforcement typically gets about 500,000 peer-to-peer leads a year, Cooper said.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-6" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We could extrapolate from that, and given the fact that each dedicated officer can only do 25 cases a year, if Congress allocated half a billion a year it still wouldn't be enough," Cooper said. "That's how big this problem is."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The prevalence of&#160;child sexual abuse material&#160;&#8212; the preferred&#160;term&#160;instead of child pornography to more accurately convey the nature of the imagery&#160;&#8212; illustrates the challenge law enforcement&#160;faces.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In 1998, the year the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children launched its cyber tipline,&#160;there were more than 3,000&#160;reports of child sexual abuse imagery; in 2018 there were 18 million,&#160;according to The New York Times. Yet funding and resources have not kept pace, Russ and other experts said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Only a fraction of the potential investigations are actually being worked, but a&#160;big part of it is their capacity to do that work. It&#8217;s not an unwillingness to do it;&#160;it&#8217;s that they're overwhelmed by the scope of the problem," said Russ, a former task force investigator. "State funding&#160;would certainly help supplement what they receive from the federal government and could allow them to be more proactive."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Advocacy groups&#160;like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which distributes tips to state task forces, face the same challenge.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Volume is certainly always going to be a challenge for all of us," said&#160;Shelley Allwang, manager of the center's child victim identification program.&#160; "But I think that&#8217;s where we can work with new technologies to detect material."&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Project VIC, a nonprofit co-founded by retired&#160;State Police Sgt. Rich Brown, is attempting to help on the technological front. The global organization works with technology companies and law enforcement to create standardized methods of gathering and analyzing data. It has built a database in the United States of 12 million child abuse images, Brown said.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="The Project VIC logo is shown at Rich Brown Neptune Township home Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020.

Rather than having to sift through abuse material seized from a crime scene to identify new images, officers can upload the material to the library and quickly learn what's been recirculated. That, in turn, allows investigators to focus on the new materials and, ideally, more quickly locate and rescue victims, Brown said.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-7" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Project VIC's primary objective is to change the approach of law enforcement to be centered on the victim rather than the crime scene or the immediate investigation of an alleged offender. Brown said he later learned that his own approach to investigations meant "there's victims that I left behind" because he was primarily focused on the abuser.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I knew enough to do warrants and&#160;do as many as I could, to get as many possession charges, to get as many possession charges with intent to distribute the images, but I wasn't really&#160;schooled on dealing with victim-centric work," Brown said.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="The Project VIC co-founder Rich Brown is shown during an interview in Neptune Township Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020.

Schools, for example, should be required to teach children about digital safety much the same way they are taught about health and opioids, he said. And parents and political leaders must recognize the threat facing children throughout the state, he said.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We can't do this alone," Pizzuro said.

  Opinion | There’s a Word for Why We Wear Masks, and Liberals Should Say It 
description: > 
  The word I mean is “freedom.” One of the key authors of the Western concept of freedom is John Stuart Mill.For that person, the first person’s “freedom” means chains — potential illness and even perhaps a death sentence.At a recent town hall in Miami, he said: “I view wearing this mask not so much protecting me, but as a patriotic responsibility.All the tough guys say, ‘Oh, I’m not wearing a mask, I’m not afraid.’ Well, be afraid for your husband, your wife, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker.That’s who you’re protecting having this mask on, and it should be viewed as a patriotic duty, to protect those around you.”

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The word I mean is &#8220;freedom.&#8221; One of the key authors of the Western concept of freedom is John Stuart Mill. In &#8220;On Liberty,&#8221; he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/millOnLibertySelections.htm#:~:text=Secondly%2C%20the%20principle%20requires%20liberty,they%20should%20think%20our%20conduct" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> that liberty (or freedom) means &#8220;doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow, without impediment from our fellow creatures, as long as what we do does not harm them even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse or wrong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Note the clause &#8220;as long as what we do does not harm them.&#8221; He tossed that in there almost as a given &#8212; indeed, it is a given. This is a standard definition of freedom, more colloquially expressed in the adage &#8220;Your freedom to do as you please with your fist ends where my jaw begins.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Now, conservatives revere Mill. But today, in the age of the pandemic, Mill and other conservative heroes like John Locke would be aghast at the way the American right wing bandies about the word &#8220;freedom.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Freedom emphatically does not include the freedom to get someone else sick. It does not include the freedom to refuse to wear a mask in the grocery store, sneeze on someone in the produce section and give him the virus. That&#8217;s not freedom for the person who is sneezed upon. For that person, the first person&#8217;s &#8220;freedom&#8221; means chains &#8212; potential illness and even perhaps a death sentence. No society can function on that definition of freedom.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Joe Biden does a pretty good job of talking about this. At a recent town hall in Miami, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>: &#8220;I view wearing this mask not so much protecting me, but as a patriotic responsibility. All the tough guys say, &#8216;Oh, I&#8217;m not wearing a mask, I&#8217;m not afraid.&#8217; Well, be afraid for your husband, your wife, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker. That&#8217;s who you&#8217;re protecting having this mask on, and it should be viewed as a patriotic duty, to protect those around you.&#8221;</p></div>

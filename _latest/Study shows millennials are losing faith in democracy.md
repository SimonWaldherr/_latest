  Study shows millennials are losing faith in democracy 
description: > 
  Young people are losing faith in democracy, a major study has found.In the 1990s and early 2000s nearly two thirds of under-35s believed in democracy, compared to just 48 per cent now.Those years saw the collapse of communism and the triumph of democracy followed by years of economic boom times.Then nearly two thirds of the younger generation, 62 per cent, believed in democracy.The report found that as the young lose trust in democracy, they are increasingly liable to see political opponents as morally flawed.

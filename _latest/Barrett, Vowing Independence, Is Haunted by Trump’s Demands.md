WASHINGTON — As Judge Amy Coney Barrett has strained to present herself this week as someone who would join the Supreme Court without having made up her mind on pivotal cases, she was haunted by the long and exceedingly public record of the voluble man who nominated her.

Like others who have found themselves politically entangled with President Trump, Judge Barrett has struggled over two days to separate herself from the trove of tweets and other pronouncements by Mr. Trump on his legal views and demands, many of which call into question the very notion of an independent judiciary.

He has said incessantly that he wants the Affordable Care Act overturned. After the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, he said he needed a full complement of nine justices on the court to resolve any legal battle over the coming election, which he has warned without evidence will most likely be fraudulent. In his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump declared that under his administration, the reversal of the Roe v. Wade decision establishing a federal right to abortion would “happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.”

The president, who early on recognized the power of Supreme Court confirmation fights to motivate voters on the right, has gone much further than his predecessors in publicly defining what he expected out of a Supreme Court justice. Judge Barrett, in turn, has been under more pressure than past nominees to demonstrate her independence, often leaving Democrats skeptical of her claims of neutrality.

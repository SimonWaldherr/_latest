description: > 
  Israel is letting thwarted tourists leave digital notes on its famed Western Wall.Wannabe tourists now have the opportunity to write a digital prayer or wish via a dedicated website, with the promise that all messages will be printed out and left in the Western Wall.“The Western Wall (or ‘Kotel’ in Hebrew) is an important piece of Jewish tradition and under normal circumstances, would attract thousands of travellers from all faiths and none.It’s the latest in a line of many “armchair travel” experiences that have been developed during the coronavirus pandemic.Back when the UK was in full lockdown, Israel promoted a whole series of virtual tours, including one that takes you around Jerusalem's most famous sights.

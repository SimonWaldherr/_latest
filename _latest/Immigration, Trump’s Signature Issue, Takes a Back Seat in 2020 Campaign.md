<div><p>When President Donald Trump announced his intention to run for president in 2016, he pledged to build a wall on the southern border that Mexico would pay for. He ran on that promise, positioning it so effectively at the center of his campaign that chants of "build the wall" quickly became familiar refrains at his rallies. </p><p>In 2018, before the midterm elections in which Democrats ultimately took back control of the House, Trump drummed up fears about a "caravan" of migrants walking through Mexico toward what he characterized as an eventual "invasion" of the U.S. </p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>And as president, his administration has taken <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/us-immigration-system-changes-trump-presidency">more than 400 executive actions that</a> have dismantled and dramatically reshaped the current immigration system. </p><p>Yet immigration has been little more than a footnote this campaign season. </p><p>Despite being Trump's signature issue as both a candidate and a president, immigration has faded from the discourse surrounding the election, pushed aside by more prominent messaging from both Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden on the coronavirus, the economy and recent racial justice protests. The issue has also slipped in voters' priorities. </p><p>It has not come up often even in moderated settings. Immigration was not discussed in any depth in the first presidential debate, the vice presidential debate, or Trump and Biden's dueling town halls last week, aside from a passing mention and a single question from an audience member. </p><p>Some &#8211; but not all &#8211; of the explanation, analysts say, is simply that current events are so pressing that they have consumed both campaigns. </p><p>"There's a point at which real-world events intrude upon the campaign in a way that can no longer be ignored," says Jacob Neiheisel, an associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo who studies political communication and elections. "And while I'm certain that Donald Trump would love to be talking about immigration, I think that's probably a pivot too far."</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"The world just isn't letting him set the agenda in this case," Neiheisel says. </p><p>The sidelining of immigration this election cycle is particularly notable considering the laser-like focus with which Trump has treated the issue during his presidency, guided by senior adviser Stephen Miller, an immigration restrictionist. In 2019, migration at the southern border reached levels not seen in over a decade.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Trump's administration has made changes, both headline-grabbing and small and technical, at a breakneck pace that have transformed the U.S. immigration system. Trump has severely restricted asylum, altered border policies, built hundreds of miles of wall on the southern border, slashed refugee admissions, made it harder for immigrants to obtain green cards and otherwise targeted legal immigration. </p><p>The administration enacted all of those changes while Trump relentlessly spewed a stream of rhetoric targeting illegal immigration and depicting many immigrants as criminals and threats to American workers. </p><p>Some of Trump's actions have made him vulnerable on immigration policy in a way that he wasn't in 2016 &#8211; a fact that, some analysts posit, may be one of the reasons his campaign isn't focusing on the issue. </p><p>Several of Trump's most prominent immigration actions &#8211; like the implementation of border policies that separated migrant children from their parents and the administration's effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program &#8211; are broadly unpopular with voters.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Public sentiment has also shifted in the last several years, with more people than ever seeing immigration as a positive phenomenon. </p><p>Opinion on both immigration in general and Trump's most well-known actions suggest that his rhetoric on the issue plays well only with his base, and analysts agree that Trump will need the votes of Americans outside of that faction to win the presidency again. </p><p>Still, Trump has not shrunk entirely from talking about immigration &#8211; at rallies, he has touted his border record, demonized immigrants and refugees, and highlighted progress on the wall. The Department of Homeland Security has tried to heighten the visibility of its immigration actions in recent weeks, holding press conferences for relatively mundane arrest operations and erecting billboards with the faces of immigrants wanted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the swing state of Pennsylvania &#8211; something officials insist has nothing to do with the election. </p><p>But the issue remains at the periphery &#8211; not the center &#8211; of Trump's campaign. Out of 10 major topics, immigration is the least-mentioned issue in Trump campaign TV ads, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-highlight-public-safety-in-campaign-ads-11603371565?st=oyb9lykknyq2xyy&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">according</a> to a Kantar/CMAG analysis for The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Biden, on the other hand, has similarly not made central Trump's immigration record. He has instead more frequently slammed the White House response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 222,000 Americans and counting, and focused on health care. </p><p>"It's easy for [Biden] to do that because all of our lives are governed by COVID-19, they're all shaken up because of it, so they know it's a message that's going to resonate with people," says David Barker, a professor of government at American University. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Biden has also attempted to distance himself from controversial immigration actions taken by the Obama administration when he was vice president &#8211; actions that alternately angered immigration advocates and Republicans. Deportations from the interior of the country spiked under President Barack Obama and his administration instituted accelerated, so-called "rocket docket" court proceedings that sparked concerns about due process. Republicans decried the creation of the DACA program by DHS as an extralegal overreach of executive authority. </p><p>Still, Barker says he's surprised Biden and the Democrats in general haven't harped on Trump's divisive immigration record more. </p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on President Donald Trump</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4fb99c3/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fe0%2F2b%2Fd6d75bbe4cd8b6db026277148f17%2F20201020edphc-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>"But my guess is that, while he benefits from talking about those things, he benefits more from talking about COVID," Barker says of the former vice president. </p><p>If the U.S. were not in the middle of dealing with a global pandemic, Neiheisel says he would expect Biden to be attacking Trump on immigration more fervently. </p><p>"If this were normal politics, I'm sure we would see that. You've seen oblique references to policy failures, but not that one. And I think it's largely because people aren't really interested right now," Neiheisel says. </p><p>Polling shows immigration has taken a back seat in voters' minds to concerns related to the pandemic and economy. In a Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/">survey</a> conducted in late summer, some 52% of Americans said immigration was "very important" to their vote &#8211; ninth on a list of issues topped by the economy, health care, the Supreme Court and the coronavirus outbreak. In a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/07/07/4-top-voting-issues-in-2016-election/">similar survey</a> taken ahead of the 2016 election, 70% of voters said immigration was "very important," making it the sixth-most important issue &#8211; ahead of Supreme Court appointments, race relations, the environment and abortion. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>The issue has slipped among the Latino voting bloc, usurped by concerns related to the coronavirus. Trump has tried to court Latino voters, particularly in the swing state of Florida. Nearly two-thirds of Latino voters say they'll vote for Biden, according to a recent Pew survey. A similar share voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. </p><p>Immigration was fifth on a list of Latino voters' top issue priorities, according to a poll conducted in August by UnidosUS and SOMOS US. The coronavirus topped voters' priorities, followed by the economy, health care and racial discrimination. In contrast, immigration has been among the top three most important issues for Latino voters in the last decade, and in some years was the No. 1 issue, according to analysis from UnidosUS, a nonprofit Latino advocacy and research organization. </p><p>"Not surprisingly, given the disproportionate impact of COVID on the Latino community, COVID response is dominating the list of priorities for Latino voters," says Clarissa Martinez de Castro, deputy vice president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, who noted that immigration remains one of the top five priorities. </p><p>Martinez de Castro says Latinos would still like to hear the campaigns discuss immigration more robustly. </p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>"If you had a functioning, robust immigration system that was working properly, some of the things that are tripping people up or that are leaving families out of relief and support would not be an issue, whether we're talking about addressing the pandemic from a health perspective or from an economic perspective," she says. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Experts also note that Trump has shifted from drilling down on animus for immigrants, like he did in 2016, to now denouncing racial justice protesters, pledging "law and order," and <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1293517514798960640?lang=en">warning</a> suburbanites that low-income housing would "invade" their neighborhood &#8211; the same language he has used about migrants. </p><p>"Public safety" is the most mentioned topic in Trump campaign TV ads, according to the analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal. The umbrella category includes messaging on "law and order," suggestions that crime would spike under Biden, ominous footage from protests and accusations that the "radical left" is seeking to defund police departments. </p><p>"The implicit message is the same, which is: Hey, suburban white women, we know that you're suburban white women swing voters, and so I believe you are afraid of Black and brown people. And because I believe that you are afraid of Black and brown people, I'm going to gin up those fears by talking about Mexican rapists running across the border in 2016 or crazy looting in the street and whatnot going on in 2020," Barker says. "The specific issue may be slightly different, but the underlying message is the same."</p><p>Beyond Trump's publicly unpopular child separation policy and polling that shows that a majority of voters oppose the border wall and attempts to dismantle the program that protects immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, public support for immigration as a whole has increased in the last several years, despite rhetoric from the White House. </p><p>About a third of Americans support increasing immigration, the highest percentage on record since 1965, according to ongoing <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/313106/americans-not-less-immigration-first-time.aspx">polling</a> from Gallup. Support for decreasing immgiration is at a record low level. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Gallup also found that 77% of Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx">say</a> immigration is good for the country &#8211; the highest level of support since Gallup started polling on the issue in 2001. </p><p>Another <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/31/majority-of-americans-continue-to-say-immigrants-strengthen-the-u-s/">survey</a>, from Pew, found 62% of Americans believe immigrants strengthen the U.S. because of their hard work and talents compared to just 28% who believe they are a burden to the country. </p><p>Each survey, however, revealed a stark partisan divide, with Democrats far more supportive of immigration than Republicans. </p><p>The Trump campaign's decision not to center immigration may in some ways be beneficial for him. There's evidence that Trump's focus on immigration as both a candidate and campaigner, and the subsequent focus on immigration by down-ballot Republican candidates, has done little to help Republicans in southwestern states where immigration is often top of mind &#8211; and could have even hurt.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>An <a href="https://winstongroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-Post-Election-Analysis-Final.pdf">analysis of the 2018 midterms</a> by Republican strategist David Winston found that immigration and the "caravan" were the issues voters heard most about from Republican candidates in the lead-up to the election, and 59% were less favorable toward GOP candidates after hearing messaging about immigration, though Republican voters were largely receptive. </p><p>It had particular consequences for Republicans with late-deciding voters. </p><p>"The closing focus in the final days of the campaign was on the immigration/caravan message, popular with the base and those at President Trump's rallies but also controversial and divisive, particularly with independents. The people who made their decision over the last few days voted Democratic by a 12-point margin," Winston wrote in the analysis. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Overall, Democrats flipped 12 House seats in the Southwest in 2018, seven of which were in California. </p><p>Two of those flipped House seats were in Texas. And in the presidential election in 2016, support for Trump in 2016 was 5 percentage points below support for Republican Mitt Romeny in 2012. Current polling shows Trump just slightly ahead of Biden in the state, which has been a Republican stronghold for decades. </p><p>Arizona in 2018 elected its first Democratic senator since 1988. Polling shows Biden barely ahead of Trump and the state is considered a toss-up. Arizona hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996. In 2016, support for the Republican presidential candidate similarly slipped 5 percentage points.</p><p>Republican support also eroded in New Mexico, Colorado and California in 2016, though New Mexico and Colorado also saw support for the Democratic candidate dip. </p><p>Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist and the president of the liberal New Democrat Network and the New Policy Institute, says he thinks Trump's previous focus on immigration has made his 2020 race more difficult.</p><p>"While immigration may not be a top issue in the current debate, it has played a major role in the election &#8211; Trump's extremism on the issue has helped push the heavily Mexican American parts of the country even further away from the president and his party, making his Electoral College map far harder, and the Senate far more likely to flip," Rosenberg says. </p><p>Frank Sharry, the executive director of America's Voice, an immigrant political advocacy organization, says he believes Trump's hard-line stance on immigration and his rhetoric on the issue have forced the American public to define their opinions in relation to the president's actions &#8211; something that has backfired for the president. </p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"Immigration has lost its salience, especially with voters in the middle. And Trump's extremism has forced American to choose whether they embrace his radicalism or reject it. And the most remarkable thing over the last four years is that a solid majority reject it," Sharry said. </p><p>"Public opinion has solidified in more progressive circles and moved decisively in a pro-immigrant direction in the middle, leaving Trump locked in the cul-de-sac of his base," he says.<br></p></div>

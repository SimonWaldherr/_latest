Best Buy will offer Black Friday deals on Oct. 13 and 14, the retailer announced Thursday. Those just happen to be the same two days as this year's rescheduled Amazon Prime Day.

"Dozens of deals, straight from Best Buy's not-yet-released Black Friday ad, will be available for two days next week," the company said. Included in its deals will be 4K TVs, laptops and wireless headphones, Best Buy said.

Customers will have options for contactless curbside pickup, in-store pickup, same- and next-day delivery, alternative-location pickup and in-store shopping with safety protocols. The safety rules include mandating face coverings and limiting the number of shoppers allowed inside at the same time. Best Buy has also extended its merchandise return period through Jan. 16 -- including for purchases made next week. And it's offering a guarantee that if a purchased item's price drops before Nov. 28, it will refund the difference.

Walmart and Target are running their own big sales next week to compete with Amazon, so you'll have plenty of shopping options.

Amazon's Prime Day typically takes place in mid-July, but the shopping event was delayed this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new dates for Prime Day change the dynamics of the event, with consumers potentially buying their holiday gifts earlier than usual because the sale takes place so much closer to the holiday shopping season.

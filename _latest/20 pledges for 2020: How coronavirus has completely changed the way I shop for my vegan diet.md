<div><p class="sc-pHJJA iocNwz above-article-prompt-donations"></p><p class="sc-qPyvj qchtz">I</p><p>&#8217;ve built up quite the collection of recipe books since I turned <a href="/topic/vegan" class="body-link">vegan</a> at the beginning of the year, and having so much time at home now because of the <a href="/topic/coronavirus" class="body-link">coronavirus</a> lockdown, there&#8217;s no better time to start using them. From BOSH to Violife, I&#8217;ve got plenty of options.</p><p>While planning my weekly shop, I took a different approach: pick five different meals for lunch, and five for dinner. (I usually bulk-cook for more than one person, so whatever I have for dinner I have for lunch the next day.) </p><p></p><p>Off I popped to Tesco on my one allotted trip of the day. It was midweek and the middle of the day, so I thought this was the ideal time to go. How wrong I was. My local Tesco is a Tesco Extra, and it&#8217;s a huge one &#8211; they have everything in there. As soon as I approached the shop, before I even got to the large car park, I could see a queue to get in stretching around the corner! A one in, one out system. It took 20 minutes just to get inside.</p><p id="article-im-prompt"></p><p>This has become the norm across the country, but to see it in my own neighbourhood was a bit of a shock.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When I made it inside, the aisles were bare: vegetables, fresh meat, dairy and pasta all taken, nothing left behind. But we&#8217;ve all seen the pictures of vegan food left on the shelves, haven&#8217;t we? I thought I&#8217;d be fine. But I was wrong again. Those images had been debunked as being from a number of years ago.</p><p>Basics that I was looking for were unavailable, and any fresh food was nowhere to be seen. No matter your diet &#8211; vegan or not &#8211; you&#8217;re going to struggle to buy food in these strange times. I walked out with just one of the five meals I planned to make that week.</p><p id="taboola-carousel-thumbnails"></p><p>I love to buy fresh food: I am not a fan of processed. But I had to succumb. Frozen sausages, burgers and ready meals will have to be the norm for the time being.</p><p>There are alternatives, like <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=16134&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://balancemeals.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link">Balance</a> and <a href="https://www.keytofood.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="body-link">Key to Food</a>, which deliver healthy and filling ready meals straight to your door.</p><p>But you simply can&#8217;t replace the joy of cooking.</p></div>

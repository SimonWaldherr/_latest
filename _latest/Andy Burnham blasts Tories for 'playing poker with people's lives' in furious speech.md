 <p>     </p> <p>In a day of drama, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> was due to give a press conference at 5pm, where he was expected to impose further restrictions on the area against the will of local leaders.</p> <p>In a furious speech to reporters, Mr Burnham accused ministers of "playing poker with places and people&#8217;s lives" through a pandemic.</p> <p>He blasted: &#8220;Are they piling pressure on people to accept the lowest figure they can get away with?</p> <p>&#8220;Is that how they&#8217;re running this country?</p> <p>&#8220;Is this a government committed to levelling up this country?</p> <p>&#8220;What we've seen today is a deliberate act of levelling down.&#8221;</p>

 <p>He said &#163;65million was the absolute minimum to "prevent poverty, to prevent hardship, to prevent homelessness"</p> <p>"Those were the figures that we had - not what we wanted - but what we needed to prevent all of those things from happening," he said.</p> <p>"But the Government refused to accept this and at 2pm today they walked away from negotiations.</p> <p>"In summary, at no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities through the punishing reality of the winter to come.</p>

 <p>"Even now I am still willing to do a deal but it cannot be on the terms that the Government offered today."</p> <p>Mr Burnham blasted ministers for scrimping on the cash bailout, saying: "At no point today were we offered enough to protect the poorest people in our communities through the punishing reality of the winter to come."</p> <p>He said Chancellor Rishi Sunak's "whatever is takes" attitude has gone.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8216;you&#8217;ll get what we will give you'," he said.</p> <p>&#8220;And that isn&#8217;t acceptable in the middle of a national crisis like a pandemic.&#8221;</p> <p>The row between northern leaders and Westminster has been running for days - with tensions boiling over earlier when Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick called time on the talks.</p> <p>Government sources indicated Greater Manchester will now be placed in Tier 3 lockdown.</p></div>

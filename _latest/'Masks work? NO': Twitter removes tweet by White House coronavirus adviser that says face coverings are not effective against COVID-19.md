<p>The social media platform has been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-changes-election-political-misinformation-policy-2020-10">cracking down on misinformation</a> in recent months, posting <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-labels-trump-tweet-saying-he-has-coronavirus-immunity-as-misleading-2020-10">warning labels on controversial tweets</a> and,<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-locked-president-trump-account-shared-email-2020-10">most recently, even temporarily blocking President Trump's account.</a></p><p>Under the new misinformation policy, Twitter prohibits sharing false or misleading content related to COVID-19, which could lead to harm.</p><p>According to a company spokesperson, Atlas's tweet was in violation of this policy, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-removes-mask-tweet-white-house-adviser-1540081">Newsweek reported.</a></p><p>"Twitter seems to be censoring the science if it goes against their own goals of public indoctrination," Atlas told Newsweek in an email, adding that he has since appealed the company's decision.</p>

<p>He also said that he made sure to "specifically and immediately" clarified in the second tweet that the correct policy was "use masks when one cannot socially distance."&#160;</p><p>Atlas has a background in neuroradiology, not infectious diseases. He joined the White House coronavirus task force in August after becoming a fixture on Fox News.</p><p>He has previously been critical of top US infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, advocating for the full reopening of schools and speaking out against lockdown measures.</p><p>His <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-atlas-new-medical-adviser-anti-lockdown-pro-schools-reopening-2020-8">new hiring has sparked concern in the scientific community</a>, as more than 100 of Atlas' former colleagues at <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/12/stanford-doctors-take-aim-at-former-colleague-scott-atlas-trumps-new-adviser-on-the-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanford Medical School</a> signed a letter warning that many of his "opinions and statements run counter to established science."</p>

<p>Billionaire Bill Gates also suggested last month that Atlas was hired because he "agrees" with what he described as the White House's "<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12702442/bill-gates-trump-fauci-scott-atlas-crackpot-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crackpot COVID theories</a>."&#160;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-atlas-hits-back-critics-questioning-science-fauci-redfield-2020-10">In an interview with Business Insider earlier this month,</a> the doctor said that he thinks the criticism "stems from people who are either politically motivated or are interested in maintaining their own stature in the public eye."</p><p>"I'm not here to be an epidemiologist. I'm here because I can translate complicated medical science ... in a way that is plain English and understandable by the public and by the White House," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website</a>, face coverings "help stop the spread of COVID-19 to others." It recommends people wear them in public, especially when it is not possible to maintain social distancing.&#160;</p>

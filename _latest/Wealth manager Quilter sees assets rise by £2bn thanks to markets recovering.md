  Wealth manager Quilter sees assets rise by £2bn thanks to markets recovering 
description: > 
  Wealth management group Quilter has upped its assets under management, despite the pandemic, rumblings over Brexit and a platform migration earlier this year.The FTSE 250 company's net inflows remained flat at £0.1billion in the three months to the end of September, but rising markets boosted total assets under management to £109.5billion from £107.4billion at the end June.The group's boss Paul Feeney said that third quarter flows were, as expected, 'seasonally weaker' than in the first half of the year.Feeney said: 'Despite a more challenging market backdrop, we are pleased with the substantial year-on-year improvement in net flows.'Shares in FTSE 250-listed Quilter are down 0.66 per cent or 0.10p to 129.15p this morning.

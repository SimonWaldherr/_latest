<div><p>Jeffrey Toobin&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/jeffrey-toobin-was-masturbating-in-front-of-new-yorker-bigs-report/">alleged masturbation on a video work call</a> is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of his reported sordid sex past.</p>
<p>The New Yorker magazine star and top CNN legal analyst &#8212; who is suspended from the publication and on leave at the network after being accused of performing manual labor in an online meeting with fellow mag talent &#8212; was outed as <a href="https://pagesix.com/2009/03/05/glad-youre-married-jeffrey/">having an extramarital affair</a> and getting his girlfriend pregnant about a decade ago.</p>
<p>Toobin, a 60-year-old longtime married dad with two adult kids by his wife, had a baby with Casey Greenfield, the daughter of one of Toobin&#8217;s then-CNN colleagues, Jeff Greenfield, in 2009, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/nyregion/in-casey-greenfields-personal-custody-fight-the-makings-of-a-public-expert.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the New York Times reported</a>.</p>
<p>Casey, who is 14 years younger than Toobin, met the Harvard Law School grad in the Conde Nast cafeteria while she was working as a fact-checker for Glamour magazine, the outlet said.</p>
<p>Toobin, who has been married to law-school sweetheart Amy McIntosh since 1986, at first denied paternity of the baby, then tests showed he was the dad, the Times said.</p>
<p>Casey ended up taking Toobin to court in Manhattan over custody and financial-support issues.</p>
<p>When news of the pair&#8217;s affair made headlines around 2010, the now-defunct Web site Gawker <a href="https://gawker.com/5476817/too-hot-for-print-cnn-anchor-jeffrey-toobins-rumored-xxx-sex-fe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an item</a> about Toobin&#8217;s alleged sexual habits titled, &#8220;Too Hot For Print: CNN Anchor Jeffrey Toobin&#8217;s Rumored XXX Sex Fetish.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>The site claimed to have a source who said Toobin had an &#8220;anal fixation&#8217;&#8217; that included enjoying anal sex and &#8220;fisting.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>A few years earlier, in 2008, while doing research for an upcoming article for The New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/02/the-dirty-trickster" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about Roger Stone</a>, Toobin went to the Miami Velvet swingers club in Florida with the kinky Republican political trickster.</p>
<p>Toobin opened up his story with the sentence, &#8220;A sign inside the front door of Miami Velvet, a night club of sorts in a warehouse-style building a few minutes from the airport, states, &#8216;If sexual activity offends you in any way, do not enter the premises.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>Toobin&#8217;s personal life again took center stage over his career Monday <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdgm4/new-yorker-suspends-jeffrey-toobin-for-zoom-dick-incident" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">when Vice reported</a> on his alleged cringe-worthy Zoom fail.</p>
<p>Two sources in last week&#8217;s online call told the Web site they saw Toobin masturbating during the virtual meeting with some of the magazine&#8217;s biggest names, as well as producers and workers from WNYC public radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera,&#8217;&#8217; Toobin later copped to Vice in a stunning admission.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believed I was not visible on Zoom. I thought no one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video,&#8217;&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize to my wife, family, friends and co-workers.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>The hashtag #metoobin &#8212; a play on the anti-sex-harassment Me Too movement &#8212; began trending on Twitter after Toobin&#8217;s alleged online masturbation.</p>
<p>The New Yorker &#8212; which has championed the movement <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/08/ronan-farrow-says-career-was-on-the-rocks-before-weinstein-expose/">with its explosive Ronan Farrow expose</a> on now-convicted sex offender and fallen Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein &#8212; said it was suspending its well-known staff writer, while CNN said Toobin was taking a leave of absence from the network.</p>
<p>Toobin was spotted under the cover of darkness on Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side early Tuesday walking his dog, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8859191/Jeffrey-Toobin-walks-dog-Zoom-masturbation-ordeal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Daily Mail.</a></p>
<p>He did not return requests for comment from The Post on Tuesday.</p>

The Supreme Court said Friday that it will review President Donald Trump's effort to exclude immigrants in the country illegally from the census count used to calculate how House seats are apportioned among the states.

A three-judge federal court ruled in September that the policy was illegal. Immigrants have never been excluded from the count determining how congressional seats and Electoral College votes are allocated, and, if allowed, the policy would have unprecedented consequences, shifting both political power and funding away from regions with large immigrant populations.

That shift would disadvantage states with populous urban areas that tend to vote Democratic and benefit Republicans.

The high court fast-tracked the case and will hear arguments on Nov. 30. Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, could be on the bench by that time, tipping the composition of the court 6-3 to justices who tend to vote conservatively.

The Trump administration's efforts to change the way the census is conducted have prompted a number of lawsuits.

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last year barring the Trump administration from adding a question to the census about respondents' citizenship.

The administration this summer announced that it would exclude immigrants in the country illegally from the apportionment of congressional seats and funding. Trump directed Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to provide him with two sets of population data – one that includes immigrants and one that does not.

The policy sparked immediate lawsuits from nearly two dozen states and the District of Columbia, 15 cities and counties, and advocacy groups.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the policy on behalf of a coalition of organizations, said the law mandates that every person counted in the census is represented in Congress.

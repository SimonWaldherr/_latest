  DOJ makes $8B settlement with Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, for role in opioid crisis The company has been widely blamed for fueling the nationâ€™s opioid epidemic.The Justice Department announced an $8 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma, the OxyContin maker widely accused of fueling the nation's opioid crisis that has been blamed for more than 400,000 American deaths in the last 20 years.The settlement resolves criminal and civil investigations into how Purdue Pharma aggressively marketed its powerful painkillers but the staggering amount is largely symbolic.Rosen said that according to the plea agreement, and subject to bankruptcy court approval, Purdue Pharma will be "be dissolved and won't exist in its current form.""Justice in this case requires exposing the truth and holding the perpetrators accountable, not rushing a settlement to beat an election.

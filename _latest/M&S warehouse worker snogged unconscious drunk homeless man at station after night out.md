 <p>     </p> <p>"All he wanted to do was have a lie down on one of the stairs and sleep it off. He accepted he may well have passed out," said Mr Longworth.</p> <p>At around 2am, a station cleaner went for a smoking break outside and he spotted Bayley who was "struggling and clearly drunk".</p> <p>As the cleaner was returning to the station concourse, he noticed out of the corner of his eye what he thought was "two men kissing", according to the prosecutor.</p> <p>He noticed one of the two men involved was the defendant and the second was a homeless person "who appeared be sleeping", said Mr Longworth.</p> <p>"He saw that the defendant was kissing the other man vigorously with no response or movement (from the homeless man) who was just asleep," said the prosecutor.</p>

 <p>     </p> <p>The cleaner said the defendant was "pushing his face into the man who was sleeping and it was not a gentle kiss".</p> <p>The defendant was applying "a lot of pressure" for a few seconds but the homeless recipient of the kiss "didn't even appear to know it was happening", the court was told.</p> <p>The homeless man was "either deeply asleep or unconscious through drink", said Mr Longworth.</p> <p>The cleaner alerted security who called police and Bayley was arrested. He later told officers he didn't know what he had been doing.</p> <p>In a victim impact statement referred to in court, the victim said: "No-one has the right to touch me without consent."</p>

 <p>Damian Zelazowski, defending, said his client had worked as a warehouseman for M&amp;S for 23 years.</p> <p>Bayley had one previous conviction for indecent assault in January 1997 when he was a juvenile.</p> <p>Judge Anthony Cross QC said that without the intervention of the railway station cleaner the victim "would never have known he was the victim of a sexual assault".</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>Bayley, of South Close in Wilmslow, was handed a 12-month community order after he had earlier admitted one charge of sexual assault. He must also carry out ten days of rehabilitation activity and sign the sex offenders' register.</p> <p>He was also ordered to pay &#163;500 compensation to his victim and &#163;500 towards prosecution costs.</p> <p>Judge Cross said the offence wasn't so serious that it required a jail sentence and he added: "I'm satisfied this was a drunken aberration."</p> <p>He went on that the sentence may have different if his victim had woken up but that the offence had had only lasted "a couple of seconds".</p></div>

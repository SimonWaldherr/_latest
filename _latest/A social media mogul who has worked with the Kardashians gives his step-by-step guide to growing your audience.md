</p><p>In 2019, he paid a total 3,500 individual influencers and celebrities to promote brand clients. The agency lists clients such as fashion giant Boohoo.com, delivery service Postmates, and ride-hailing service Lyft.</p><p>Here's Fleyshman's guide to growing a social media audience.</p><h3><strong>Be yourself, and be consistent<br></strong></h3><p>Picking the right content to share on social media isn't especially difficult.</p><p>Just think about the things you enjoy doing and watching, whether it's a cooking class or a car repair video, Fleyshman said. The key is that you genuinely like what you're sharing and posting about.</p>

<p>"You can't just go copy something and pretend you like it. Consistency matters, and if you're pretending, you won't actually be able to do it," he said.</p><p>Consistency is key to engage and build an audience: once you start creating content, be consistent on how much you post and engage with your follower per day.</p><h3><strong>Create content based on your real-life experience and stand out</strong></h3><p>People want to relate to you.</p><p>The biggest influencers in the world are "just normal or quirky, or creative or a bit weird, and that's what makes them interesting," Fleyshman told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>"I've watched very, very normal basic people become humongous stars. As long as you can show raw who you are, that will supersede any creative personality that you come up with."</p><p>He cited TikTok star Charlie Amelio, who has over 79.9M followers and is among the most popular creators on the app. Amelio is not a celebrity, but was a competitive dancer and posts footage of her dancing interspersed with goofy, un-choreographed clips. "She's a normal girl, and people are drawn to it," he said.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Once you have picked your core focus, while it may sound contradictory, mix in other content and see how people engage with anything you post that features day-to-day life.&#160;<strong><br></strong></p><p>For example, if you make a dance video, what do people say? If you make a cooking video, how do viewers react? And if the cooking video did five times better than the other ones, "you don't need dad to tell you what to do, make more cooking videos," he said.&#160;</p>

<p>The popularity of these posts will just help you find your core focus.&#160;</p><h3><strong>Be omnipresent</strong></h3><p>As your audience grows, you should establish a social media presence on all the major platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Tik Tok, and YouTube. Even if you're only focused on growing one account, "be omnipresent &#8230; you don't know how your followers might come to find you" he said.&#160;</p><p>Other channels like Pinterest or LinkedIn are good if you're in a niche and for example, target professionals or create business-related videos.&#160;</p><p>Start by creating content for one platform and repurpose the content to another channel &#8212; take the exact same caption, photo or video and post it on the other relevant platforms.&#160;</p><p>While it might not get many views or followers in every channel, the cost and risk are zero, but as you still just need one chance to get lucky, you never know where your post could go viral, he said.</p>

Tapped by the folks over at the vector brand, the show hosted by Sean Evans is applying their touch to the<a href="https://sneakernews.com/tag/reebok-shaqnosis/"> Reebok Shaqnosis</a>. This comes as no surprise considering <a href="https://sneakernews.com/tag/shaq/">Shaq</a> was a special guest on the show back in March 2019, and was funny enough spotted choking on a hot chip in the process.</p>
<p>Areas such as the suede bases, leather overlays, and treading are all identically styled in solid black, but it&#8217;s the spice-inspired accents here that convey its lively spirit. Pepper-like accents of red, yellow, and green border the aforementioned overlays, as well as bleed onto the midsoles, and the interior sock liners are decorated with all-over flame graphics. Furthermore, the Hot Ones logo rests along both insoles, and the tongues are adorned with the neon light-esque pepper silhouettes and text-based &#8220;Scoville Level&#8221; hits to nod to the method in which spiciness is measured. Scroll down here to check out a detailed look, and find these dropping via <a href="http://bit.ly/2IzlNK2">Reebok.com</a> on November 19th.</p>

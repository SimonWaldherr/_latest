<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister tonight said he had been left with no choice but to impose the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants as well as banning households from mixing indoors and in most outdoor settings after the Government was unable to reach a deal with local leaders in Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson said he appreciated the rules are 'tough, both on businesses and individuals' but that the move to the Very High alert level is needed in order to combat a surge in coronavirus cases in the region.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added he regretted the fact the Government had been unable to strike a deal with Mr Burnham because&#160;'we would have a better chance of defeating the virus if we work together'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said the funding package offered to the region was proportionate to what was offered to Merseyside and Lancashire which are already in Tier Three.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson said 'unfortunately' Mr Burnham opted not to accept the deal as he added: 'Given the public health situation, I must now proceed with moving Greater Manchester, as I say, to the Very High alert level because not to act would put Manchester's NHS, and the lives of many of Manchester's residents, at risk.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The offer made by Mr Johnson on extra business support was believed to have been worth &#163;60 million but it was not immediately clear whether the region would still be able to access the cash after the two sides failed to agree terms.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson's comments came after Mr Burnham effectively declared class war on the Prime Minister for dooming Greater Manchester to lockdown 'poverty' by refusing to hand over a 'bare minimum' &#163;65 million bailout.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At his own press conference earlier this afternoon, the mayor had launched a furious tirade at the Government for imposing the harshest level of curbs without 'proper support', saying he had asked for what the region 'needed'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Painting himself as the champion of the northern working class, Mr Burnham said: 'It wasn't about what we wanted, it was about what we needed... what we have seen today is a deliberate act of levelling down.'&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson and Mr Burnham made a final bid to thrash out a bailout package in a phone call at lunchtime as a noon deadline passed. The premier upped his offer of business support from &#163;55million.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mr Burnham continued to demand &#163;65million, saying the region needed &#163;15million a month to top up furlough payments to 80 per cent of usual wages, rather than the two-thirds provided by Rishi Sunak. 'It was his pride that got in the way of striking a deal,' one government source said.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The news immediately sparked a brutal blame game, with Labour desperate to pin the shambles on the Government and Tory MPs also fuming.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite slamming 'penny pinching' ministers, Mr Burnham told people in Greater Manchester to 'observe the law at all times'.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Burnham had taken aim at 'selective' figures highlighted by Downing Street that suggested Greater Manchester hospitals could be overwhelmed within weeks unless tougher action is taken. He insisted intensive care bed occupancy was about normal for this time of year, at 80 per cent.&#160;</p><img id="i-d5ddc39e641ac382" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-d5ddc39e641ac382" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/17/34625342-0-image-a-15_1603209892161.jpg" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-d88a2be35772e62d" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-d88a2be35772e62d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/17/34625338-0-image-a-18_1603209924783.jpg" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-98f5bdf546cb723f" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-98f5bdf546cb723f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/17/34625350-0-image-a-13_1603209879072.jpg" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-b790a1e3f6cdb153" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-b790a1e3f6cdb153" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/17/34625330-0-image-a-16_1603209910232.jpg" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-9c4141199e555a4d" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-9c4141199e555a4d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/17/34625352-8860289-image-a-22_1603210123280.jpg" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-74f707af7898eaa1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-74f707af7898eaa1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/17/34625340-8860289-image-a-20_1603210080724.jpg" height="541" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-9291a27a18fbc21" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="672" width="960" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-9291a27a18fbc21" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/18/34423288-8860289-image-a-57_1603215139826.jpg" height="672" width="960" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Boris Johnson warns Britain is 'walking a narrow path' as UK records 241 deaths and 21,331 COVID daily cases - the highest since June&#160;</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">Boris Johnson today warned the UK is walking a 'narrow path' as it tries to squash the Covid-19 without hammering the economy with drastic lockdown rules after health officials recorded 241 more coronavirus deaths and another 21,331 cases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The deaths mark a rise of 68.5 per cent from the 143 confirmed last Tuesday, while the cases are a 23.8 per cent jump on 17,234.

Cardi B and her estranged husband Offset sparked rumors they have rekindled their love, after spotted sharing a kiss at her wild 28th birthday party in Las Vegas on Saturday.

The WAP rapper and Migos talent didn't look like they were at odds, despite the fact Cardi officially filed for divorce September 16th.

In addition to publicly locking lips, the hitmaker grinded on the rapper outside a night club, after partying with pals Megan Thee Stallion and DJ SpinKing.

On again? Cardi B and her estranged husband Offset spark rumors they have rekindled their love, after sharing a kiss at her wild 28th birthday party in Las Vegas on Saturday

The Grammy nominee, who is the father of the Bronx-born performer's two-year-old daughter Kulture, appeared in high spirits during the very friendly exchange.

Meanwhile, the I Like It crooner was blown away after he surprised her with a Rolls Royce truck, days after he already gifted her a bright pink billboard from their tot.

The costly vehicle was even customized for the star, as her little girl's name could be seen embroidered on a lush car seat.

Earlier in the night, she could be seen getting even cozier with her on-again, off-again flame, in a skintight white gown, which showed off her famous derriere.

Dancing: The Bodak Yellow singer let loose, as she publicly reunited with her ex for the first time, since announcing she filed for divorce from on September 16

The Bodak Yellow singer has not commented on her current relationship status with Offset, since she filed for divorce on September 16.

While Saturday night marked the duo's first sighting together since announcing their split, she has continued to defend him from social media attacks.

Earlier this week, in a since-deleted tweet, she said the father-of-four was a 'dumba** not a bad man.'

According to Complex the since-deleted tweets continued: '...cause out of everybody that tried to steal, finesse me into working with their brand for less he got people coming for me with CORRECT CONTRACTS and never ask for a dollar or benefit like every1 else. N***** is n**** but a bad personality he not.'

Cardi (born Belcalis Marlenis Alm√°nzar) also threatened to 'slap the s*** out of' one Twitter user 'out of courtesy' of their toddler.

Wow! While not all her friends could be physically present for her birthday amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Kylie Jenner sent a memorable gift

'I don't give a f*** if you don't like him,' the Me Gusta rapper wrote in a second deleted tweet - according to People.

'I don't talk to him but you not going to disrespect my child father...If he die, go broke, you not the one that's going to raise my kid & you not the 1 who pays for her s***.'

Cardi amicably filed for divorce from the 28-year-old Migos rapper last month- days before what would've been their third wedding anniversary, because she was 'tired of f*****g arguing' but not over infidelity.

Offset (born Kiari Kendrell Cephus) is also father to three older children - daughter Kalea, 5; son Jordan, 10; and son Kody, 5 - with babymamas Shya L'amour, Justine Watson, and Oriel Jamie.

The Need It hip-hop star will next perform on October 16 in downtown Atlanta to 'help raise money for artists and creatives who have or are experiencing economic hardship due to the COVID-19.'

Cardi- whose 'DMs are flooded' with potential suitors - had an exciting week, as she received towering desserts and gifts ahead of her birthday.

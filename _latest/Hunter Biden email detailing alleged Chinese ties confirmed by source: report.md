An email thread that appears to show Hunter Biden pursuing a lucrative energy business deal in China — and possibly cutting his father in on the action — has been verified as authentic by one of its recipients, Fox News reported Friday night.

The Fox report also cast light on a tantalizing mystery in the emails, as first raised by The Post — a reference to 10 percent of the proposed business’s equity perhaps going to “The big guy.”

“The big guy” was a reference to Joe Biden, Fox revealed, citing unnamed “sources.”

The Post had broken the news of the Chinese wheeling-dealings on Thursday — but the reference to “the big guy” had not previously been clarified.

Fox’s source verifying that the emails are authentic is not named, but the network said the person was someone copied on the thread.

Hunter Biden, in the email, was identified as “Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC,” an apparent reference to the former Shanghai-based conglomerate CEFC China Energy Co.

The email outlined a “provisional agreement” under which 80 percent of the “equity,” or shares in the new company, would be split equally among four people whose initials correspond to the sender and three recipients, with “H” apparently referring to Hunter Biden.

The deal also listed “10 Jim” and “10 held by H for the big guy?”

“Sources told Fox News that “the big guy” is a reference to the former vice president,” Fox reported.

Biden’s campaign has denied wrongdoing.

The couple first met in 2002, and they have two sons together, 12-year-old Johan and 5-year-old Jonas.

Fabolous revealed on Father's Day in June that he 'got the best gift ever for Father's Day' with the hashtag #GirlDad and revealing the sonogram of his daughter.

He also shared a photo of him with his son's on Father's Day, adding, 'Happy Father’s Day to everyone from #TheFamily'

Bustamante also honored her longtime boyfriend on Father's Day with a heartfelt post on her own Instagram.

'One day isn’t enough to honor how phenomenal of a father you truly are because you are special every day,' she said.

'Thank you for all that you do for our family! I love you! Happy Father’s Day,' Bustamante concluded.

Bustamante is best known for appearing on VH1's Love and Hip-Hop: New York from 2011 to 2012.

She also appeared in VH1's Chrissy and Mr. Jones alongside Chrissy Lampkin and rapper Jim Jones.

Last year, Fabolous narrowly avoided jail time by taking a deal in a domestic violence case stemming from a string of incidents with Emily in 2018.

In October 2018, the rapper was indicted on 'one count of domestic violence with significant bodily injury, two counts of threatening to kill and one count of possession of a weapon,' TMZ reported.

The charges were stemming from a physical altercation between Fabolous and Emily that was captured on tape.

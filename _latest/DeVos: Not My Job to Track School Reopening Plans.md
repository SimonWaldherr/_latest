  "I'm not sure there's a role at the department to collect and compile that research," DeVos said at an event hosted by the Milken Institute."The data is there for those who want it," she said, referencing the various state and county public health databases.Educators have been especially critical of DeVos and the Trump administration for lack of guidance, especially given how much pressure the White House has put on them to reopen for in-person learning."This is a significant missed opportunity," Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director of policy and advocacy at AASA, the Superintendents Association, says.The superintendents association, along with the National Association of Secondary School Principals, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, researchers and others, have taken it upon themselves to build a dashboard of school infection rates paired with reopening plans.

<div><p>Shooting for the highly anticipated sequel of <i>KGF: Chapter 1</i> is currently underway. While fans wait for the film&#8217;s release, a recent update is here to reignite the hype. Actress Srinidhi Shetty celebrates her birthday today and to commemorate the occasion, the makers of<i> KGF: Chapter 2</i> dropped a first look image of her character from the period drama. Shetty is back to reprise her role as the female lead of the Prashanth Neel directorial starring Yash and Sanjay Dutt.</p>

<p>The actress who made her debut with <i>KGF: Chapter 1</i> is all set to make a comeback as Reena alongside superstar Yash who is reprising his role as Rocky. <i>KGF: Chapter 2</i> picks up where the first film left off with Sanjay Dutt stepping into the shoes of villain Adheera again. Back in July, the film&#8217;s creators dropped the Vikings-inspired first look of his character. Before that, a cryptic look at Adheera was teased last year confirming fan speculations of Dutt&#8217;s return to the franchise.</p>

<p><i>KGF: Chapter 2</i>, like most films in production during the pandemic, hit a snag but is back on track with the shooting schedule in full-swing in Hyderabad. Sanjay Dutt who was recently diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in a statement today announced that he has beaten cancer and has &#8220;come out victorious from this battle&#8221;. So he is likely to join the final leg of shooting after taking a short break.</p>

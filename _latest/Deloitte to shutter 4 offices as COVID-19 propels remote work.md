"As a result, we are proposing our Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton offices will permanently close and the firm is consulting with Deloitte people based out of these offices to move to a permanent homeworking contract."</p><p>Deloitte is headquartered in London and is currently the largest professional services firm in the world by revenue. The company did not say how many people this would impact, but Reuters reported these offices accommodate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-deloitte/deloitte-to-shut-four-uk-offices-as-covid-19-entrenches-remote-working-idUSKBN2720FX" target="_blank">some 500 staff members</a>.</p><p>Griggs emphasized that everyone currently employed at these locations will continue to be employed by Deloitte, "and any proposed change is to our 'bricks and mortar,' not our presence in these regions."</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Offices of Deloitte are seen in London, Sept. 25, 2017." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>"We remain committed to these regional markets and will continue our close relationships with our clients, society partners and communities, just without a physical building," he added.</p><p>The move comes as a handful of U.S. firms also announced extended, or even permanent, remote work arrangements -- many of which have been accelerated by the pandemic.

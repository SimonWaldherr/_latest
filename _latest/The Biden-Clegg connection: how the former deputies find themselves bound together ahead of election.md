<div><p>In 2018, when Joe Biden appeared on<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/15/donald-trumps-facebook-row-escalates-joe-biden-son-story/"> Sir Nick Clegg&#8217;s</a> post-Brexit podcast &#8220;Anger Management&#8221;, the ex-Lib Dem leader was glowing of his former opposite number.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the people I met in Government, I genuinely never met someone who had so much wisdom, and so much warmth,&#8221; he said of the former US vice president.</p>
<p>Sir Nick, who is now <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/19/facebook-goes-war-apple-despite-not-traditional-rivals/">Facebook&#8217;s</a> global head of policy and communications, has much in common with Biden: both deputy heads of government during the overlap between Barack Obama's presidency and David Cameron's Coalition government, and seemingly friends ever since.</p>
<p>Now, after four years of careful bargaining and quiet concessions to President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, Facebook may soon have to<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/15/facebook-twitter-fast-becoming-arbiters-truth/"> explain itself </a>to a Democratic Party that blames its services for stoking extremism, enabling discrimination and putting Trump in the White House in 2016.</p>
<p>If there is a hope of rapprochement - as very well there might be, given Facebook's overwhelmingly progressive workforce - it is likely to begin with the one-time MP for Sheffield Hallam.&#160;</p>
<p>"It absolutely helps," says Steve Goldstein, a former top official under Presidents Bush and Trump who has met both Sir Nick and Biden and dealt with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/14/facebook-twitter-spark-republican-fury-cutting-traffic-disputed/">Facebook </a>in his official duties.&#160;</p>
<p>"When he was hired it was a bit of a surprise, because they hired somebody from outside the United States, but they also hired a former politician. I'm sure it was done to emphasise the global nature of the corporation... looking back on it, it was a very smart move on Facebook's part."</p>
<p>Biden and Sir Nick enjoyed their time together as deputy heads of state. After securing the White House in 2012 with Obama, the then Vice President thanked his opposite number for his &#8220;friendship&#8221; and praised the &#8220;close and enduring relationship&#8221; between the UK and the US.</p>
<p>A year later, Sir Nick used Biden&#8217;s visit to the UK to stress the importance of Britain remaining in the European Union. During the visit, he declared that the US vice-president was a &#8220;real friend of the UK&#8221;.</p>
<p>The pair were also founding members of the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, which launched in May 2018. The commission pulled together public and private sector leaders to help identify and plug gaps that could be exposed during elections.&#160;</p>

When Boris Johnson announced his three-tier approach to local lockdowns on Monday he promised it would provide much-needed clarity and hand local leaders a stake in decision making.

But just four days later, the Government’s new strategy was already at risk of unravelling after local leaders used the very authority they had been given to stand in Mr Johnson’s way and expose the flaws in his plan.

Having convinced Liverpool to close its pubs, bars, gyms and betting shops, Whitehall officials were confident that swathes of northern England would follow in short order.

What neither the Prime Minister nor any of his closest aides appeared to have planned for was the possibility that other local leaders would have the temerity to say “no”.

Manchester resists

No other area has highlighted the fragility of the Government’s approach more than Greater Manchester, where the Labour mayor Andy Burnham has led the charge against closing the region’s pubs and bars.

The plan, as originally devised earlier this week, had been for Manchester to enter into Tier 3 by Thursday, along with Lancashire and possibly the North East and Yorkshire.

However, after days of political wrangling only Lancashire had agreed to join Tier 3 restrictions as of Friday night, with leaders in the North East convincing ministers to hold off for another week.

Mr. Bledose is garnering 4 percent in the survey while 8 percent of voters over all say they are undecided in the Senate race. Notably, 6 percent of South Carolina Republicans said they were undecided in the Senate contest while only 2 percent of them said the same about the presidential race.

Mr. Graham, seeking a fourth term, is capturing 89 percent of Republicans, a number he will need to increase to stave off Mr. Harrison’s challenge, given the likelihood of Black voters moving to the Democrat.

The good news for Mr. Graham as it relates to his own base is that he’s now on center stage in Congress, wielding the gavel at the Senate Judiciary Committee each day this week during Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s televised confirmation hearings.

Fifty-two percent of South Carolinians said they backed Ms. Coney Barrett’s confirmation while only 30 percent said they opposed it. The support for her was even higher among college-educated white voters, with 59 percent of them backing her appointment.

Notably, Mr. Graham fared better in the survey in the final two nights of polling calls to voters, after the Supreme Court hearings had begun. In the initial calls, starting last week, the Senate race appeared closely divided. But this week, Mr. Graham actually fared better among respondents than Mr. Trump.

Mr. Harrison’s fund-raising has also spurred more Republican donors to give to Mr. Graham, who raised $28 million over the past three months.

Still, Mr. Graham, who has scarcely faced a competitive race since he was first elected to the House in 1994, is in the fight of his political life.

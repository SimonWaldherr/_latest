The world’s tallest teen also has a growing follower count on social media.

Maci Currin, 17, is set to have her name in next year’s Guinness World Records book for two titles — longest female legs and longest teenage legs — assets she proudly documents on Instagram and TikTok, along with her message of self-empowerment.

“The ‘Tall’ Friend,” the 6-foot-10 Texan wrote over a TikTok clip of herself proudly standing next to a list of ways her record-breaking height has made socializing a challenge, including “confident but insecure,” “only good at sports,” and “attracts creeps.”

In her Instagram bio, Currin proudly lists her height along with the famous Oscar Wilde quote, “Be yourself. Everyone else is taken.”

She has racked up over 52,000 followers on the platform, despite currently having just seven posts available for public view. “Confidence is key,” reads the caption on one gallery, including a picture of a masked Currin making a peace sign. The post, published in early August, has racked up over 10,000 likes.

On TikTok, Currin goes by DadddyGiraffe and frequently publishes videos of herself dancing, and is also open about her mental health struggles.

Although Currin’s family is far from petite — her father stands at 6-foot-5 and her mother at 5-foot-7 — she is significantly taller than both of them, with her legs making up 60% of her height. Her right leg measures 53.255 inches, and her slightly shorter left leg comes in at 52.874 inches.

Her height, however, makes finding properly fitting clothing and driving a constant struggle. “I hit my head on a lot of stuff. Cars are really difficult,” she told Newsflare. “Pants and leggings, I have to get them custom-made.”

She has also had to deal with bullying from small-minded classmates.

“I was bullied because I was taller than everyone,” she said of growing up in the Austin suburb of Cedar Park. She hopes having her name in the Guinness book will help other tall women embrace their lankiness and not listen to the haters.

“I hope tall women can see height is a gift. You should really embrace it,” she said.

<div><p class="p1">It&#8217;s been nearly two years since <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dji" target="_blank">DJI </a> released the original Osmo Pocket. Honestly, the little gimbal is one of the most delightful products from a company that makes a lot of them. As &#8212; at best &#8212; an amateur smartphone photographer, I enjoyed my time with the product and am pretty psyched to get a little hands-on time with the sequel.</p>
<p class="p1">The new product streamlines the name a bit, dropping the &#8220;Osmo&#8221; to become, simply, the DJI Pocket 2. Like its predecessor, it works as both a standalone camera, or a smartphone accessory, using a handset and a large display to preview shots in real time. The three-axis gimbal can record 4K video at 60 frames a second. HDR video is now on board, as is a 8x hybrid zoom (or 4x optical). A four-mic system has been added to improve sound recording.</p>
<p class="p1">As ever with DJI, the software is a big piece. I was really impressed with the way the company was able to bring some of its drones&#8217; more advanced shooting modes to the product, allowing for polished, cinematic shots on a pocket-sized device. The new version has a half-dozen or so different modes. Per DJI:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Pro Mode</b>: Control advanced camera settings such as ISO, shutter speed, EV, and focus mode.</li>
<li><b>ActiveTrack 3.0</b>: Select a subject and let DJI Pocket 2 keep it in the frame automatically.</li>
<li><b>Slow Motion</b>: Capture the fast-moving world in slow motion with a max speed and resolution of 8x at 1080p.</li>
<li><b>Timelapse, Hyperlapse, Motionlapse</b>: Speed up the world around you with the varying effects of three different time-lapse operations. Hyperlapse automatically integrates Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) for added smoothness. Users have the ability to save individual images separately, record in RAW format, and use ActiveTrack 3.0.</li>
<li><b>Panoramas</b>:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3">180&#176; Pano: Captures four photos for sweeping landscape images.</li>
<li class="li3">3&#215;3 Pano: Merges nine images for a wide and detailed view.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Livestreaming:</b> Livestream directly to Facebook, YouTube, or RTMP.</li>
<li><b>Story Mode:</b> Preset camera movements, color profiles, and music make it easier to choose a template, record the moment, and share to social media instantly</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The hardware&#8217;s been redesigned a bit this time out, with a removable baseplate for attaching a bunch of new accessories, including an additional microphone, charging case and wireless housing. There&#8217;s a wireless module as well, which lets it connect to a smartphone without having to plug it in directly.</p>

It retains the original&#8217;s $349 starting price, which includes a control stick and tripod mount. The $499 Creator Combo adds a wide-angle lens, wireless mic with windscreen and a mini tripod. Both are available through <a href="https://www.dji.com/">DJI&#8217;s site</a> starting November 1.</p>

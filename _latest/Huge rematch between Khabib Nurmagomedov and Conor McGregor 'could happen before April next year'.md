Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor could fight at the start of next year in a huge rematch if 'the stars align', the Russian's coach Javier Mendez has claimed.

The lightweight champion is currently preparing to face Justin Gaethje at UFC 254 on October 24 and McGregor wants to fight Dustin Poirier before the end of the year, although the UFC want the fight on January 23.

If both men come through their respective contests then there's a chance of a massive rematch before April next year.

McGregor has not fought since January but wants to take on Dustin Poirier before 2020

Mendez told SunSport: 'Conor did say it has to be before the end of this year.

'Think about this - Khabib will not fight past the end of April next year (due to Ramadan).

'So if the stars align properly, based off what Conor is saying, then he could want to put himself in that picture for next year.

'He has to beat Dustin and then obviously that makes sense. We have to be victorious and then we'll see what Dana offers us.'

The undefeated Russian put McGregor away with a submission back in October 2018

Khabib has repeatedly shut down chances of a McGregor rematch since beating him two years ago then infamously jumping the cage to spark a brawl.

And his manager Ali Abdelaziz has called on the Irishman to earn back the opportunity to go for the belt.

A rematch win over Poirier, who Khabib beat in a title defence last year, would certainly put the former two-weight champion back in the mix.

It remains to be seen whether Khabib would want the fight again, given the toxic build-up to their first encounter and ugly scenes that followed in T-Mobile Arena.

But if he accepted the match-up it would inevitably be the biggest fight in UFC history.

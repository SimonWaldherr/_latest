The Buckeyes will lean on star quarterback Justin Fields in hopes of reaching the College Football Playoff for the second straight year.</p><p class="">Since the eight-game conference-only regular season (plus one "championship week" contest) is shorter than usual, one loss is even more damaging. It's especially critical to begin stacking wins immediately; otherwise, a team has zero margin for error.</p></ol>

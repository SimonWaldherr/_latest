  The Big Role That Big Donors Still Play, Quietly, for Joe Biden 
description: > 
  “Joe Biden is running against the most corrupt and dishonest president in our history, and has done so while maintaining a standard of transparency and integrity that is far above how his opponent has conducted himself this campaign,” said T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden.Keep up with Election 2020For Mr. Biden, six-figure donors have been critical in delivering him a surprise financial advantage over Mr. Trump.The Democratic challenger entered October with $180 million more in the bank than Mr. Trump combined with their political parties — coincidentally almost the same amount that $100,000-plus contributors have given him.To further loosen some donor wallets, the Biden campaign has been holding closed-door events with some of the candidate’s top policy advisers, offering access to potential key decision-makers in a Biden administration.After being contacted this week by The New York Times, the Biden campaign said it would disclose its bundlers by the end of the month.

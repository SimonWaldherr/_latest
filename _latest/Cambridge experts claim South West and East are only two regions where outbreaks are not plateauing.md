  AdvertisementCoronavirus outbreaks are surging in the East of England and South Westâ€” but are plateauing everywhere else in England, top scientists have claimed.And in the South West it is ticking upwards by seven per cent, up to 894.EAST OF ENGLAND: These graphs show the rising infections according to Cambridge experts (left) and Public Health England (right).AdvertisementThe Cambridge academics wrote: 'Transmission as measured by the R values is increasing in the East of England and the South West, while showing a plateauing in the North East and the South East and a slight decrease in the remaining regions.'For comparison, the figure in the South East is estimated to be just 1,570.

And in the South West it is ticking upwards by seven per cent, up to 894.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although these levels are streets away from the tens of thousands of Covid-19 infections that occurred each day during the peak of the pandemic, experts say they are concerning because many people in the regions have not been exposed to the virus &#8212; meaning they do not have immunity against it, which could allow the disease to spread further faster.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are the only regions where the R rate &#8212;&#160;the average number of people each Covid-19 patient infects &#8212; is definitely not falling or staying stable. The North East has an equally high rate but this has fallen, the scientists believe. If the R stays at one or above the epidemic will never shrink.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They estimate the reproduction rate in the East has surged to 1.5, the highest in the country, and in the South West it has ticked up to 1.4. But in all other areas it has either remained the same or declined.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the North East and Yorkshire, while it remained high despite tightened restrictions, it has dropped from 1.5 to around 1.4 &#8212; the same level as the South West.

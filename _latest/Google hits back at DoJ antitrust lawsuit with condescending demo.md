  Google hits back at DoJ antitrust lawsuit with condescending demo 
description: > 
  'The Department's complaint relies on dubious antitrust arguments to criticize our efforts to make Google Search easily available to people.The lawsuit asks Google to enter 'structural relief' against any parties harmed and that it end the antitrust 'agreements'.'For many years, Google has used anticompetitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertisingâ€”the cornerstones of its empire.''These manufacturers and carriers are beholden to Google's Android ecosystem, which Google uses to preserve its monopolies in general search, search advertising, and general search text advertising.'Not only does it occupy the search engine space but Alphabet, its parent company, also owns YouTube, which has dominated online video platforms for years.

GLANCE</h3> <p class="mol-para-with-font">The Department of Justice lawsuit claims that Google is breaching The Sherman Act by unfairly locking up portions of the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are three facets to how the government claims it does this;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1) Dominating search engine space</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Google, through both its deals placing its search engine above others on devices and through public interest in it, accounts for 80 percent of every internet search in the US&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2020, it accounted for 94% of all mobile searches in the US&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">2) Monetizing its dominance through ads</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Google monetizes the amount people use it with ads, which generate around $40billion in revenue every year&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3) Spending its billions to cement its dominance with 'exclusionary deals'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the money it makes through ads, Google pays companies like Apple, LG and others to block out any of its competitors from having their search engine preferred on devices&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Among the deals is one with Apple. Google is the default on Safari on iPhones and it's also the default on Siri.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The deal amounts to up to a fifth of Apple's worldwide income which last year would have been around $11billion&#160;</p><p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_1"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>
</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">It claims that Google's 'exclusionary' partnerships with companies like Apple and others mean no other search engines have the opportunity to compete at all. Because Google makes by far the most money through monetizing its search engine and therefore has the most to spend placing its ads, the others are likely never to be considered for placement on the devices.&#160;Eleven Republican Attorneys General have signed on to it.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Google denies this, claiming their competitors are welcome to go after the contracts.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Department's complaint relies on dubious antitrust arguments to criticize our efforts to make Google Search easily available to people.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, like countless other businesses, we pay to promote our services, just like a cereal brand might pay a supermarket to stock its products at the end of a row or on a shelf at eye level. For digital services, when you first buy a device, it has a kind of home screen &#8220;eye level shelf.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'On mobile, that shelf is controlled by Apple, as well as companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon, Samsung and LG. On desktop computers, that shelf space is overwhelmingly controlled by Microsoft.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So, we negotiate agreements with many of those companies for eye-level shelf space. But let's be clear&#8212;our competitors are readily available too, if you want to use them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our agreements with Apple and other device makers and carriers are no different from the agreements that many other companies have traditionally used to distribute software. Other search engines, including Microsoft&#8217;s Bing, compete with us for these agreements. And our agreements have passed repeated antitrust reviews.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Walker said the company's contract with Apple, for example, uses Google's product because it is 'the best' and that Yahoo and Bing can also pay to have their search engines feature predominantly.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Changing your search engine in Safari is easy. On desktop, one click and you&#8217;re presented with a range of options.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Apple&#8217;s iPhone makes it simple to change your settings and use alternative search engines in Safari&#8212;and it&#8217;s even easier in iOS14 where you can add widgets from different providers or swipe on the home screen to search,' Walker wrote.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Google is not preloaded onto Microsoft - which uses its own search engine, Bing.&#160;</p><img id="i-dbf0a7cee34d3d7e" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="389" width="470" alt="Part of the response from Google on Tuesday afternoon" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-dbf0a7cee34d3d7e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/20/34631428-8860831-image-a-43_1603222242229.jpg" height="389" width="470" alt="Part of the response from Google on Tuesday afternoon" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Part of the response from Google on Tuesday afternoon&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Walker goes on to say: 'The bigger point is that people don&#8217;t use Google because they have to, they use it because they choose to.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This isn&#8217;t the dial up 1990s,&#160;when changing services was slow and difficult, and often required you to buy and install software with a CD-ROM.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Today, you can easily download your choice of apps or change your default settings in a matter of seconds&#8212;faster than you can walk to another aisle in the grocery store.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The lawsuit claims Americans aren't sophisticated enough to do this. We know that's not true.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We understand that with our success comes scrutiny, but we stand by our position.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'American antitrust law is designed to promote innovation and help consumers, not tilt the playing field in favor of particular competitors or make it harder for people to get the services they want.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We&#8217;re confident that a court will conclude that this suit doesn&#8217;t square with either the facts or the law.</p><img id="i-c5178fc59b07fba" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="413" width="470" alt="Google's SVP of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, penned the response" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-c5178fc59b07fba" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/20/34631012-8860831-Google_s_SVP_of_Global_Affairs_Kent_Walker_penned_the_response-a-39_1603220535635.jpg" height="413" width="470" alt="Google's SVP of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, penned the response" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Google's SVP of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, penned the response</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In the meantime, we remain absolutely focused on delivering the free services that help Americans every day.

In 2019, that would have amounted to $11billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The deal is so vital to Google that the company views losing its default status on Apple devices as a 'Code Red' scenario.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2018, the complaint states, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart: &#8216;Our vision is that we work as if we are one company.&#8217;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an announcement on Tuesday morning, Attorney General Bill Barr said: 'Today, millions of Americans rely on the Internet and online platforms for their daily lives.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Competition in this industry is vitally important, which is why today&#8217;s challenge against Google &#8212; the gatekeeper of the Internet &#8212; for violating antitrust laws is a monumental case both for the Department of Justice and for the American people.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Since my confirmation, I have prioritized the Department&#8217;s review of online market-leading platforms to ensure that our technology industries remain competitive.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This lawsuit strikes at the heart of Google&#8217;s grip over the internet for millions of American consumers, advertisers, small businesses and entrepreneurs beholden to an unlawful monopolist.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Deputy AG Jeffrey Rosen said: 'As with its historic antitrust actions against AT&amp;T in 1974 and Microsoft in 1998, the Department is again enforcing the Sherman Act to restore the role of competition and open the door to the next wave of innovation&#8212;this time in vital digital markets.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The government sued AT&amp;T in 1974 claiming it preserved an unlawful monopoly over telecommunications.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It then sued Microsoft in the late 90s claiming it held too much power over the internet and should be broken up into two companies.&#160;Microsoft appealed the decision and won.&#160;

Andrew Bailey has said that swathes of workers could be condemned to long-term unemployment after figures showed that coronavirus restrictions have triggered a surge in job losses.

The Bank of England Governor warned that Britain's economy is going through a profound change as short-term fixes to stop the coronavirus threaten to become permanent, snuffing out businesses and destroying jobs.

He was speaking after unemployment hit its highest level for more than three years as the impact of the Covid-19 crisis triggered record redundancies.

“As Covid returns, and if the prospect is that it will go on for longer, there are two reasons why the prospect of scarring could increase,” the Governor told the House of Lords’ economic affairs committee.

“One is because there are more companies and employers who can't survive. The second is that there are activities which may turn out not to be ones that we demand, that we change our habits in ways which cause a need for people to relocate in the labour market and learn new skills.”

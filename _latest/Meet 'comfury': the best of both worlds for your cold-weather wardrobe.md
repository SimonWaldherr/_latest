  Meet 'comfury': the best of both worlds for your cold-weather wardrobe 
description: > 
  If there’s one positive we can take from 2020 it has to be that, in fashion terms, we’ve been comfier than ever.In one of our Telegraph fashion team morning catch-ups recently, we were discussing a Paris Fashion Week collection (that shall remain nameless) in which, for every pillow-soft sneaker, there was some constraining piece of tailoring.So what’s your winter version of loungewear and summer breeziness?I’m calling it ‘comfury’: a way of dressing that prioritises comfort but doesn’t feel at all slobby.Hence, comfort + luxury = comfury.

<div><p>If there&#8217;s one positive we can take from 2020 it has to be that, in fashion terms, <a>we&#8217;ve been comfier than ever.</a> All those leggings, stretchy crop tops and wafty summer dresses have been a total treat.</p>
<p>In one of our Telegraph fashion team morning catch-ups recently, we were discussing a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/paris-fashion-week/paris-fashion-week-city-style-faced-new-reality/">Paris Fashion Week</a> collection (that shall remain nameless) in which, for every pillow-soft sneaker, there was some constraining piece of tailoring. &#8216;Well, we can&#8217;t have it all,&#8217; we sighed in unison, before remembering that, actually, if there&#8217;s one sphere where having it all shouldn&#8217;t be too tricky, then what we wear really is it.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s your winter version of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/shopping/best-loungewear-sets-what-wear-working-from-home-lockdown/">loungewear</a> and summer breeziness? I&#8217;m calling it &#8216;comfury&#8217;: a way of dressing that prioritises comfort but doesn&#8217;t feel at all slobby. In fact, it&#8217;s luxurious. Hence, comfort + luxury = comfury. So much so that you can wear it anywhere.</p>

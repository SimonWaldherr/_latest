  House GOP write letter to Amtrak CEO questioning Joe Biden's campaign train tour 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON – House Republicans said they will push an inquiry into Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s use of an Amtrak charter train to campaign.In a letter to Amtrak President and Chief Executive Officer William Flynn, four GOP members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee asked whether the Biden campaign use of an Amtrak charter train on a campaign swing through Ohio and Pennsylvania last month drained resources from the struggling government-subsidized railroad.The Biden campaign raised the criticism in its response, with the campaign’s deputy national press secretary Matt Hill saying in a statement, "Anyone can charter a train with Amtrak.Last time we checked, no one can charter the White House South Lawn for a political convention."On Wednesday, the Democratic nominee posted a video on Twitter detailing his love of the trains and defended his tour.

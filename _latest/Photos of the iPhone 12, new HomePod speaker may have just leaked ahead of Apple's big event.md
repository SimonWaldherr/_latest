Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 12 lineup and a new HomePod speaker at its October 13 event.

But leaker Evan Blass published what he claims are images of the new iPhones and HomePod just hours before the company's event.

The images line up with previous leaks about the colours choices we're expecting to see for the iPhone 12.

Apple is expected to unveil its iPhone 12 lineup at an event on Tuesday, but the device's design and colour options may have leaked just hours before the official unveil.

Leaker Evan Blass, who has a track record of publishing leaks about unreleased tech gadgets, posted photos claiming to show the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and a new HomePod mini speaker. The images line up with previous leaks that have emerged about the phones, such as that the iPhone 12 will have a dual camera setup while the iPhone 12 Pro will have a triple-lens camera like the iPhone 11 Pro.

According to Blass, the iPhone 12 will come in black, blue, green, red, and white, while the iPhone 12 Pro will come in blue, gold, graphite, and silver. That lines up with details recently published by a leaker known as "Kang," who recently listed the same colour choices.

Blass also posted images of what appears to be a shorter, rounder HomePod smart speaker in space gray and white colour options. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple is working on a smaller and cheaper version of the HomePod.

Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Blass has a reputation for accurately leaking tech products before they officially launch. For example, he recently published renders of Samsung's Galaxy S20 Fan Edition before it debuted.

The iPhone 12 is expected to be one of Apple's biggest product launches in years, kicking off what some analysts expect will be a major upgrade cycle for the tech giant. The device is widely expected to be Apple's first smartphone lineup to support 5G, coming after major device makers like Samsung, Google, and Huawei have all launched 5G devices.

The combination of 5G support, new size options, relatively affordable pricing, and the notion that many active iPhones are starting to get older could result in a "supercycle" of upgrades, says Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.

"It's almost the perfect storm of demand for Apple, which is really why it's a supercycle," Ives said to Business Insider.

Apple's event starts at 19:00 South Africa time. The company typically reveals its new iPhones in September, but the launch was delayed this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

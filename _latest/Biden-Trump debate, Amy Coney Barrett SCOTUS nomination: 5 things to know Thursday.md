The&#160;high-stakes political event could be a&#160;make-or-break moment for the president, who has been trailing Biden nationally by double digits in some polls. For Biden, experts said,&#160;the goal is much easier: Do no harm. In addition, the Commission on Presidential Debates said it will mute each candidate's microphone for two minutes as their rival&#160;answers&#160;questions&#160;&#8212; a move experts described as unprecedented in a general election presidential debate.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="A server wears a face shield and face-covering as people sit to watch a broadcast of the first debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Senate panel to vote on Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to SCOTUS</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/21/any-coney-barrett-senate-vote-monday-supreme-court-nominee/6005198002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Senate panel charged with vetting Amy Coney Barrett</a> is&#160;set to approve her nomination&#160;to the Supreme Court on Thursday. &#160;Democrats are expected to employ a variety of procedural tactics to delay Thursday&#8217;s hearing but have&#160;acknowledged they cannot block&#160;what appears to be her inevitable confirmation to the high court.&#160;Barrett is expected to be approved in a party line 12-10 vote.&#160;Thursday's vote follows four days of hearings last week, where senators peppered Barrett with questions about a host of issues that could&#160;come before the high court, including the Affordable Care Act, abortion, voting rights and climate change.&#160;The full Senate&#160;will then take up her nomination and tee up a final vote for&#160;Monday.&#160;</p><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Amy Coney Barrett: </strong>Full Senate to vote on <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/21/any-coney-barrett-senate-vote-monday-supreme-court-nominee/6005198002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Trump's Supreme Court nominee on Monday</a></li><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Senate Democrats</strong> will boycott confirmation hearing vote <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/21/amy-coney-barrett-dems-boycott-supreme-court-confirmation-hearing/3720336001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">as GOP vows to move forward</a></li></ul><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/politics/2020/09/28/judge-amy-coney-barrett-nominated-us-supreme-court-president-trump/3559581001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Mike Pence will head to Indiana between rallies</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Vice President Mike Pence <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/21/heres-why-vice-president-mike-pence-campaigning-his-home-state/3720360001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">will collect some much-needed campaign dollars from his home state</a> during a trip to Indiana on Thursday &#8212; a visit that is sandwiched between multiple rallies in battleground states. &#160;Pence will meet privately with a group of donors before a public rally at an airport in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who Bill Bean, a GOP donor and developer,&#160;said was squeezed into Pence&#8217;s schedule as a &#8220;favor to the supporters here in the area&#8221; and not because the Trump/Pence campaign is concerned about losing Indiana or because the coffers are running dry."

The forecast called for winds of nearly 60 mph Wednesday night&#160;over the western portions of the fire&#160;before cold&#160;and windy weather with the possibility of snow moves into the area later Thursday into early Friday. "We are looking at another&#160;critical fire weather day,'' Paul Delmerico, the fire's operations section chief,&#160;said. "These conditions are really tough for firefighters.''&#160;By Wednesday night, the Cameron Peak Fire&#160;had grown to more than 206,000 acres.&#160;Another of the 11 wildfires burning in Colorado, the East Troublesome Fire, forced the mandatory evacuation&#160;Wednesday night of Grand Lake, a town of about 500 people located about 100 miles&#160;northwest of Denver. The blaze, which had torched about 20,000 acres and was just 10% contained, was "growing faster than we can catch it right,"&#160;Incident Commander Jake Winfield warned Wednesday night.</p></div>

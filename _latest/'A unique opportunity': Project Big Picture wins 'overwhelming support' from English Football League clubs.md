Project Big Picture, and its promise of a £250 million bailout, has won the clear support of English Football League clubs, who have claimed that it is also in the long-term interests of many Premier League teams.

Citing the regular churn between the Premier League and the EFL, Peter Ridsdale, the former Leeds United chairman who is now advising Preston North End, urged clubs outside the top 10 to think strategically about the future probability of relegation to the Championship and a more equitable share of income.

Ridsdale admitted that he did not trust the Premier League ‘Big Six’ and their collective commitment to the pyramid but, in the context of a government that “appears to have abandoned football”, described the proposals as a “unique opportunity”.

He also said that there were “no dissenting voices” on Tuesday’s conference call of Championship clubs and complete support for EFL chairman Rick Parry. In League One, Gillingham chairman Paul Scally said that he could not recall anyone speaking “badly” about the plans but acknowledged that concerns were raised. It is understood that Lincoln City were the most sceptical.

In League Two, Leyton Orient chairman Nigel Travis said that 23 out of 24 clubs were in favour of a deal that would finance immediate stadium improvements at his club. “I’d go further than ‘overwhelming support’, I’d say there’s excitement about the opportunity,” he said. “All my potential new investors have been phoning me up saying, ‘can we get going now’.”

Mark Palios, the former FA chief executive and owner of League Two Tranmere United, however, outlined his opposition in an interview with Telegraph Sport.

“What you actually want to do is to smooth the gaps across the pyramid, rather than taking a route that will increase the gap sometime in the future and will mean the end of the pyramid as we know it with relegation and promotion,” said Palios. “You have to come back to the central premise that this plan is all about short-term gains for longer-term damage.

“People need to think about what the pyramid will look like in 20 years, 40 years’ time and I think there is a moral need to do that.” A majority of other clubs, however, believe that Parry’s plan is urgently needed. Ridsdale said that the “football pyramid as we know it won’t exist” without a comprehensive reset.

Jez Moxey, the Burton Albion chief executive and also an EFL board member, was adamant that the FA’s ‘golden share’ provided sufficient “inbuilt protection” against fears that the 'Big Six' Premier League clubs would use special voting rights to alter basic rules around promotion and relegation. He also said that he was “not worried” about the threat of a breakaway and that it was now “incumbent” on the Premier League to start rationally debating the way forward following “painstakingly frustrating” talks. “The government is frustrated,” he said. “Oliver Dowden [the culture secretary] is expecting the Premier League to step forward and fulfill the promise they made.”

Moxey, who previously also held senior executive positions at Wolverhampton Wanderers and Stoke City, said that there was an urgent need to rescue some clubs.

“We literally have clubs right now that are worried about paying October’s payroll and we have got concerns over Championship clubs having to pay PAYE payments,” he said. “Be under no illusion, we are talking about now. Right this second.”

Travis also stressed that the clubs had retained “huge faith” in Parry, who has angered sections of the Premier League by holding talks with Liverpool and Manchester United about Project Big Picture. “There’s no other alternative on the table,” said Travis. “No one else has come up with anything palatable. It’s a great answer for the future of English football at all levels.”

Scally was adamant that clubs were not “looking to sell their soul for £250m” and said that, more than six months into the Covid-19 crisis, he was only aware of a £25m suggestion from the Premier League.

Palios, though, warned his EFL counterparts not to be taken in by “sweeteners” within the proposal. “They are designed to obfuscate I think what is the main issue and that is the long-term damage it does to the pyramid by giving the power to the ‘Big Six’,” he said. “I think the process has been woeful. I don’t think the EFL chairman should, without consulting the EFL, have gone forwards. This is something that needs to be dealt with in a much more mature environment than in a crisis that’s been self-induced by football’s patent and obvious inability to govern itself or to fix itself and address the pandemic in a sensible way. I think the time has come for the government to accept that football can’t manage itself, and it isn’t awash with cash as it thinks.”

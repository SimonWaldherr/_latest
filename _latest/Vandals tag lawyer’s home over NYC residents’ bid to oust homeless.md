<div><p>Vandals splattered the front of a prominent Manhattan lawyer&#8217;s home with graffiti blaring, &#8220;Randy Mastro you can&#8217;t displace us&#8221; and &#8220;F&#8211;k you Randy&#8221; after he represented a group of residents in their bid to close a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/27/hotel-lucerne-on-upper-west-side-converts-to-homeless-shelter/">West 79th Street hotel</a> that houses homeless men.</p>
<p>Mastro, a former deputy mayor under Rudy Giuliani, was not home at his Upper East Side residence when it was tagged sometime Tuesday night, a source told The Post, but he was alerted by a neighbor whose home was also vandalized and they both reported the incident to the NYPD.</p>
<p>Red paint was splashed on the front door and the words &#8220;prick,&#8221; &#8220;shame,&#8221; &#8220;Randy Mastro you can&#8217;t displace us&#8221; and &#8220;F&#8211;k you Randy&#8221; were written on the building&#8217;s facade and sidewalk in red and pink.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very sad day to see a genuine debate about serious issues involving the homeless devolve into vandalism targeting my family&#8217;s home. The persons who did this are criminals who should be brought to justice. And if they thought they were going to intimidate me, they picked the wrong guy,&#8221; Mastro told The Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will continue to be a passionate advocate against housing homeless adults in SRO hotels where they don&#8217;t get the services [they] need. This vulnerable population requires housing in proper shelters with full services. The City says it is committed to doing just that, and I will continue to advocate for it because that is the right and humane thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>UWS Hearts Initiative, a group that opposes Mastro&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/mayor-de-blasios-plan-to-move-uws-homeless-to-fidi-hotel-approved/">effort to relocate</a> about 235 homeless men with mental illness or struggling with substance abuse living at the Lucerne Hotel on West 79th Street, tweeted about the incident Wednesday morning.</p>

 
	<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve received reports from one of our faith leaders that Randy Mastro&#8217;s home has been vandalized. UWS Open Hearts and Lucerne residents unequivocally condemn this kind of personal attack. Our fight is for human dignity for all, and we extend our support to the Mastro family,&#8221; the group tweeted.</p>
<p>A second source said NYPD detectives were interviewing homeless men at the Lucerne about the incident. Police reps did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio announced <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/08/de-blasio-to-stop-using-nycs-lucerne-hotel-as-homeless-shelter/">in early September</a> that he would stop using the Lucerne as a homeless shelter after Mastro threatened a lawsuit.</p>
<p>But the men remain in the converted facility after a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/lucerne-hotel-homeless-win-order-barring-move-downtown-for-now/">Manhattan judge blocked</a> their move, following legal challenges both by Lucerne residents and <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/city-halts-transfer-of-homeless-lucerne-hotel-residents/">a group of Financial District neighbors</a> who live near a shuttered Radisson Hotel that city officials planned to use as their new shelter.</p>

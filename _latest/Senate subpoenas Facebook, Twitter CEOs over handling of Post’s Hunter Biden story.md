<p>Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday authorized subpoenas for the Facebook and Twitter CEOs after accusing them of engaging in &#8220;suppression and/or censorship&#8221; of The Post&#8217;s reporting.</p>
<p>The Post earlier this month reported on an <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">email to Hunter Biden</a> from an adviser to the board of Burisma thanking him for the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to meet his father. At the time, Hunter Biden served on the board and his father was vice president.</p>
<p>Twitter has refused to unlock The Post&#8217;s account unless the news organization deletes tweets about its own reporting. Facebook, meanwhile, suppressed the story in users&#8217; news feeds.</p>
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz last week railed against &#8220;big tech billionaires drunk on their own power,&#8221; and called Facebook and Twitter&#8217;s behavior a &#8220;brazen attempt to manipulate the election outcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>With their Senate majority, Republicans control the committee, and there is little Democrats can do to prevent the hearing from taking place.</p>
<p>Facebook declined to comment on Thursday. Representatives for Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Shares of Facebook were down 0.4 percent Thursday morning, while Twitter was trading down 2.2 percent.</p>

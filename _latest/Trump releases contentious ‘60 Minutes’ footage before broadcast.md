<div><p>President Trump on Thursday <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/350524406214941" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released nearly 38 minutes</a> of video footage from a &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview that he walked out of Tuesday after claiming bias from correspondent Lesley Stahl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the bias, hatred and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS. Tonight&#8217;s anchor, Kristen Welker, is far worse! #MAGA,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1319298695683334144" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump wrote on Twitter</a>, linking to a Facebook video.</p>
<p>The White House video was recorded for archival purposes. It&#8217;s unprecedented for a president to release footage of a TV interview before its television broadcast.</p>
<p>Stahl began the interview asking about why Trump wants to be president, before hammering him on COVID-19 statistics.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/trump-tweets-video-of-mask-free-lesley-stahl-after-60-minutes-interview/">vented about Stahl&#8217;s conduct</a> this week and accused her of hypocrisy for not wearing a mask.</p>

Much more to come,&#8221; the&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1318644698341408769" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">president tweeted</a> on Tuesday to his 87 million followers.</p>
<p>The CBS News program on Thursday <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/22/lesley-stahl-pushes-back-at-trump-over-greatest-economy-in-history-claim/">released a snippet</a> of the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/trump-tweets-pics-from-fake-lesley-stahl-60-minutes-interview/">interview with Trump</a> that showed the veteran reporter pushing back on the president&#8217;s claim that he created the &#8220;greatest economy in history.&#8221;</p>

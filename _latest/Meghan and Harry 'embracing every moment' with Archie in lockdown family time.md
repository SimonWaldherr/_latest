 <p>     </p> <p>The special edition of Time magazine's TIME100 Talks saw Meghan and Harry host a discussion around the topic of 'Engineering a Better World.'</p> <p>The royal couple want online communities to become more trustworthy, kind and safe for users.</p> <p>Commenting on mental health, Harry said that the question of how someone is doing was one which people previously "threw around", but had now become something which people really meant.</p>

   <p>He said the couple were "good", adding: "There's a lot of stuff to be focused on, a lot of work.</p> <p>"This is an opportunity to spend more time as a family than we probably would otherwise."</p> <p>Meghan wore an Alexander McQueen Grain de Poudre suit-blazer, which retails at $1,995 - &#163;1,544 - which she was worn before, and trousers costing $795 - &#163;615 - which she first wore in February 2018 at the annual Endeavour Fund Awards.</p>

 <p>Her wrist was adorned with a Cartier 'Love' Bracelet worth $6,500 - &#163;5,031.</p> <p>She appeared to also be wearing Princess Diana's gold Cartier Tank Fran&#231;aise watch. A present from Harry, it was reportedly worth &#163;17,800 when Diana wore it but would now be worth significantly more due to its historical significance.</p> <p>The couple have recently been outspoken on a range of issues, comparing social media users to drug addicts, supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and touching on concerns of voter suppression in the US election.</p>

 <p>Ahead of today's talk, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/meghan-markle-wears-princess-dianas-22862050">a black and white photo of Meghan and Harry was newly released</a>, where the 38-year-old was spotted wearing Diana's watch.</p> <p>The couple appeared happy and relaxed as they posed for the camera, with Meghan wearing the same attire as today while Harry, 35, wore a matching outfit of a simple white shirt and suit while smiling directly to the camera.</p> <p>He left his top button open and neglected to don a tie, cementing his laid-back approach.</p>

 <p>As well as Ohanian, the couple also spoke with to Rappler CEO and executive editor Maria Ressa and co-director of the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry Safiya Noble.</p> <p>This is a topic close to Meghan's heart as the former actress recently opened up about mental health due to "unsurvivable" and "damaging" online trolling.</p> <p>She said: "I'm told that in 2019 I was the most trolled person in the entire world, male or female.</p>

 <p>"But what was able to be manufactured and churned out, it&#8217;s almost unsurvivable. I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re 15 or you&#8217;re 25 - if people are saying things about you that aren&#8217;t true, what that does to your mental and emotional health is so damaging."</p> <p>This is the latest event the couple have been involved with and last month a list of demands for speaking engagements was leaked.</p> <p>In the four-page "Virtual Event Request Form", in which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex outline their rules - including having the final say in who introduces them.</p> <img>

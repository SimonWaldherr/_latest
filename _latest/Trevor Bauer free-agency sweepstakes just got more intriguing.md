<div><p>The Reds don&#8217;t sound overly optimistic about their chances of keeping Trevor Bauer in free agency.</p>
<p>The NL Cy Young favorite is headed into free agency and has spent the postseason &#8212; after the Reds were swept in two games by the Braves &#8212; flirting with teams he thinks could bid for his services this offseason.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a very good pitching staff this year,&#8221;<a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/mlb/reds/2020/10/19/trevor-bauer-free-agency-cincinnati-reds-chance-sign-him/5980239002/"> Reds new GM Nick Krall told the Cincinnati Enquirer.</a> &#8220;We&#8217;re going to lose some free agents. We&#8217;ve got to figure out a way to replace those innings and get quality innings. Offensively, we underperformed somewhat. There are some things we can work with to hopefully get our offense back on the right track and more consistent with what we can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krall said &#8220;of course&#8221; the Reds would try to bring back Bauer, but the outspoken 29-year-old is poised to become one of the richest players in the game. Bauer had a 1.73 ERA with 100 strikeouts in 11 starts this season.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Kinda looks like the @yankees could use some more starting pitching. Interesting,&#8217;&#8217; <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/08/trevor-bauer-flirts-with-yankees-could-use-more-starting-pitching/">Bauer wrote on Twitter during Game 3 of the ALDS.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Hey @redsox you up?&#8221; <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/05/trevor-bauer-flirts-with-red-sox-as-intriguing-free-agency-nears/">Bauer wrote when he was in Boston earlier this month.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I really like Trevor personally, and everything he&#8217;s brought,&#8221; Krall said. &#8220;I think that some people look at him and say, from the outside looking in, you&#8217;ve got a guy and that he&#8217;s this. He was great for our ballclub. He really was.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was great to see his thought process on how he wanted to get better and where he could maximize his skills. It was also great to see how he jelled with our coaching staff and our players in our clubhouse as well to progress and help other people progress.&#8221;</p>

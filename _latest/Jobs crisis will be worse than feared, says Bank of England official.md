  Jobs crisis will be worse than feared, says Bank of England official 
description: > 
  A senior Bank of England official has warned Britain's jobs crisis is likely to be worse than it feared after a surge in redundancies.Gertjan Vlieghe struck a far more downbeat tone that the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane who has hailed Britain's rapid economic recovery.With just 11 days before the closure of the Government's job retention scheme, Vlieghe said around 9 per cent of workers – roughly 2m people – remain furloughed.Figures last week showed unemployment at a three-year high of 4.5 per cent between June and the end of August.With this in mind, he said the Bank is more likely than not to do more to stimulate the economy.

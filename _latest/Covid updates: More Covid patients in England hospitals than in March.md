We're also following the update from Wales, where Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething is giving a briefing.

He says he and Wales' first minister joined the Cobra meeting that was chaired by the UK PM Boris Johnson this morning.

All four nations of the UK are in charge of making their own coronavirus lockdown rules and have different restrictions in place.

Asked whether the Welsh government could decide to ban travellers coming in from England, Mr Gething says he and the Welsh first minister are "deeply disappointed" that the PM Boris Johnson is "still taking the approach where there is only going to be guidance on whether people should or shouldn't travel in and out of highly infected areas".

Mr Gething adds: "There is clear evidence the virus is waking up for the winter."

He says coronavirus is moving quickly through the UK and through Wales.

"I do not want to scare people but I do want people to understand we potentially face a very difficult few months ahead of us," he says.

One person in every 500 has coronavirus in Wales, he adds.

He says the Welsh government is considering all options - including potentially national measures.

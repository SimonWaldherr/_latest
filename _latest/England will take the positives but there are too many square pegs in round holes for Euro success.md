Right-back Kieran Trippier filled in again at left-back, right-back Kyle Walker played in a three-man central defence and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold looked uncomfortable at right wing-back. You get the picture.

Southgate would justifiably argue that he is short of left-sided players, particularly given Ben Chilwell’s absence, but he picked six central defenders in his enlarged squad and only two of them got on the pitch against Belgium.

Even when the England manager made a second-half change at the back, it was another right-back, this time Reece James, who replaced Alexander-Arnold.

Eric Dier has played in a back three for both England and Tottenham Hotspur this season, but largely on the left side and not in the middle as he was asked to do against Belgium.

So it should not have been a huge surprise that Dier struggled to live with Romelu Lukaku and produced a clumsy 15th-minute challenge that resulted in a penalty after being outpaced by the former Manchester United striker.

Conor Coady, who plays every week in the middle of a back three for Wolverhampton Wanderers, had been impressive in his two England performances so why not test him against better opposition?

Despite his poor form for Manchester United, Harry Maguire took the place on the left of England’s back three, while Tyrone Mings, who has been key to Aston Villa’s excellent start to the season and is naturally left-footed, watched from the stands.

Maguire would certainly be a player who has, according to Southgate, plenty of credit in the bank for his performances in the World Cup in Russia. But there is currently no strong argument for why he should be starting for his country.

It should be noted that England’s defence coped much better with Lukaku after the break, but they could have easily conceded three or more goals by then.

There had been a pre-match clamour for Jack Grealish, man of the match in the victory over Wales, to retain his place but the Villa captain did not make it on to the pitch on Sunday night.

Mount’s deflected goal, together with the victory, offered Southgate justification for the decision, but it did not offer a strong disciplinary message that Jadon Sancho got on ahead of Grealish as a substitute.

Sancho, of course, was one of three players who were not available for the Wales game after breaking coronavirus regulations by attending a party in the days leading up to international duty.

Having sat out the meaningless friendly against Wales, Sancho’s punishment did not extend to him having to watch the entire 90 minutes of the Belgium Nations League game from the bench as he replaced Mount late on.

The disciplinary messages, just as England’s performances of late, have been mixed. Despite this result, they will most likely continue to be so unless Southgate finds a better fit for all of his pieces.

<div><p>It&#8217;s official: cute animals are good for you. A recent joint study from Leeds University and Tourism Western Australia has found that we humans benefit physically and psychologically from watching them. For the students who were the subjects of the survey, under stress from forthcoming exams, images of quokkas and other adorable creatures slowed their heartbeat, lowered their blood pressure and reduced their anxiety levels by up to 35 per cent.</p>
<p>This may come as little surprise to those of us who own pets. As we&#8217;ve reached out for physical comfort during our lockdown isolation, there can hardly be a tabby or labradoodle that hasn&#8217;t been cuddled to within an inch of its life. Google records that our appetite for cuddly animals on YouTube has also skyrocketed in recent months.&#160;</p>
<p>But which animals are cute? The study chose some usual suspects, from kittens to alpacas. Among them was the quokka, a small wallaby from Western Australia, whose rounded, furry contours and toothy grin have catapulted it to internet stardom, generating countless selfies for visitors to Rottnest Island, where the species is unusually tame.</p>
<p>Scientists have long identified the qualities that endear such animals to us. Typically, these include large eyes and rounded bodies: a combination known as the &#8220;baby schema&#8221;. In other words, these animals resemble human infants and so trigger our protective instincts. In scientific terms, they stimulate the pleasure hormones dopamine and oxytocin, which help cement the bond between parent and infant.</p>
<p>This explains why many &#8220;cute&#8221; animals enjoy that status only in infant form. Polar bears, rhinos and orang-utans are hardly creatures that invite a cuddle as adults, but check out those baby pics and it takes the hardest heart not to ooh and aah like a devoted grandparent.&#160;</p>

<p>Movement also helps. The clumsy, trunk-flapping bravado of a baby elephant is irresistible, inviting as it does an unconscious comparison with our own toddlers&#8217; first inept attempts to navigate their world.&#160;</p>
<p>Animals also qualify as cute through their apparent comic mimicry of our behaviour. Think waddling penguins or overbalancing meerkat sentries: neither is especially appealing in static isolation, but a little anthropomorphism makes them delightful.&#160;</p>
<p>Similarly, we love dolphins for their toothy &#8220;smiles&#8221;, but that upward curve to the mouth is simply the jawline of a fish-eater. The apparent smiles of quokkas have seen them labelled the &#8220;happiest animals on earth&#8221;. Really? In reality, we humans are the only smilers. Even in chimpanzees, our closest relatives, a grin is a tooth-baring signal of aggression.</p>
<p>Sadly, cuteness has its downside for some animals. Numerous species, from fennec foxes in North Africa to slow lorises in Indonesia, are still captured to meet a lucrative illegal market in exotic pets. Many die in the process, or are disposed of once they turn out to have sharp teeth, smelly territorial habits and no interest in a cuddle.</p>
<p>So for now, rest assured that simply by watching our cutest critters on screen, you are doing yourself good. And when the world opens up again, why not seek them out on a responsible wildlife trip &#8211; thus promoting their conservation while boosting your own recovery from lockdown blues? Here are 10 ideas.</p>
<h3>Quokka, Western Australia</h3>
<p>Fact-checking website Snopes once had to confirm that the quokka really exists, following online claims that the animal is &#8220;too cute to be real&#8221;. This cuddly, cat-sized marsupial is, in fact, one of Australia&#8217;s 54 species of macropod&#8211; the family of big-footed bouncers that comprises wallabies and kangaroos. It was once widespread around Western Australia&#8217;s coastline but competition from cats, dogs and invasive foxes has left it confined it to a few protected retreats &#8211; notably Rottnest Island, near Perth. Largely nocturnal, quokkas snooze by day andemerge at dusk, often clambering into low trees to browse. On Rottnest, they have become very tame, with &#8220;quokka selfies&#8221; now an internet sensation.</p>

<h3>Silky anteater, Trinidad</h3>
<p>Remember Clangers? Imagine one of those knitted children&#8217;s puppets curled around a branch. This, essentially, is the silky anteater &#8211; the world&#8217;s smallest anteater and so dinky it could snuggle into a teapot. By day, curled into a ball, its silky fur helps pass it off as a seed pod of the silk-cotton tree in which it often roosts. At dusk, it uncurls to reveal a blinky-eyed face and a long prehensile tail, then sets out in search of ants, eating up to 5,000 per night. These arboreal adorables are widespread throughout Central and South America, but extremely elusive. In a few locations, including Trinidad&#8217;s Caroni Swamp, experienced guides know where to look. Just don&#8217;t ask to see the Soup Dragon.</p>
<p><b>Naturetrek (01962 733051; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.naturetrek.co.uk" target="_blank">naturetrek.co.uk</a>) offers a nine-day natural history tour, based at Trinidad&#8217;s Asa Wright Centre. Silky anteaters may be at Caroni Swamp, while prolific birdlife includes such specials as scarlet ibis. From &#163;3,695 per person, including international flights. Departures April 2021.</b></p>

<h3>Red panda, Nepal</h3>
<p>First things first: this cat-sized native of the Himalayan foothills is not related to the giant panda &#8211; actually a bear &#8211; but belongs in a family all its own, closer toraccoons. However, the two animals do share an appetite for bamboo, which comprises two thirds of the red panda&#8217;s diet. Either way, this shy, nocturnal mammal is undeniably cute, with its lustrous fur, bushy tail and teddy-bear face. It is also highly elusive, with hunting and habitat loss having placed it on the endangered list. Today, guided forest treks offer excellent viewing opportunities, while helping boost the species&#8217; conservation</p>
<p><b>Responsible Travel (01273 823700; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.responsibletravel.com" target="_blank">responsibletravel.com</a>) offers a 10-night, small-group, guided red panda tracking tour to Nepal, boasting 95 per cent viewing success. From &#163;2,395 per person full-board; excluding international flights.</b></p>

<h3>Black-footed cat, South Africa</h3>
<p>Cute does not always mean friendly. Weighing just 4lb, this diminutive feline may resemble a chocolate-box kitten, but its Afrikaans nickname of miershooptier, or &#8220;anthill tiger&#8221;, is a reminder of its ferocity. This is Africa&#8217;s smallest cat and confined to South Africa&#8217;s arid Karoo region, plus parts of neighbouring Botswana and Namibia. Able to capture prey as big as hares, it hunts by night and hides by day in an old termite mound or disused aardvark burrow. Like other nocturnal predators, this cat is very elusive, but spotlit night drives may get lucky. Just don&#8217;t stick your hand down that burrow.</p>
<p><b>Aardvark Safaris (01980 849160; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.aardvarksafaris.co.uk" target="_blank">aardvarksafaris.co.uk</a>) offers sevennights at Samara Private Game Reserve in South Africa, where night drives search for blackfooted cats, alongside other creatures. Big game, including black rhinos, is seen by day. From &#163;2,485 per person, based on two sharing, including international flights, road transfer, full-board accommodation</b>.</p>

<h3>Arctic fox, Iceland</h3>
<p>First, this animal is a fox &#8211; closely related to the red suburban version that plunders our bins. But one look at that gorgeous coat and innocent expression, and it&#8217;s hard to imagine getting too cross. The arctic fox is one of the world&#8217;s most northerly mammals, living right around the Arctic Circle. Smaller tha nthe red fox, its snubbier nose, shorter legs and rounded body appear modified for cuteness. In fact, they are all about reducing surface area to minimise heat loss. This is Iceland&#8217;s only native mammal, and today the wild Westfjords region is an excellent place to see it.</p>
<p><b>Wildlife Worldwide (01962 302086;&#160;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wildlifeworldwide.com" target="_blank">wildlifeworldwide.com</a>) is offering a six-night trip to Iceland&#8217;s wild Hornstrandir Peninsula to photograph arctic foxes with award-winning photographer Bret Charman. Includes Northern Lights, seabirds and a visit to the Arctic Fox Centre in Sudavik. From &#163;2,895pp sharing, including flights, accommodation, most meals, transfers and activities. Departures March/April 2021.</b></p>

<h3>Beluga, Canada</h3>
<p>No marine animal has a friendlier face than this all-white Arctic whale, with its winning dolphin smile and shiny round forehead. Add its unique colouration to the mix, together with a sing-song vocal repertoire that has earned it the nickname &#8220;sea canary&#8221;, and it is little wonder that this engaging sea mammal is so popular with humans. That toothy grin is, of course, for catching fish, while the prominent forehead houses the &#8220;melon&#8221; &#8211; a fatty organ that receives a bounce-backstream of echo location clicks to help detect prey deep beneath the pack-ice. During the summer season, belugas migrate to shallow waters, such as Canada&#8217;s Hudson Bay, where thousands of the creatures congregate to give birth and to slough off their oldskin. Here, their natural curiosity makes them very approachable.</p>
<p><b>Natural World Safaris (01273691642; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.naturalworldsafaris.com" target="_blank">naturalworldsafaris.com</a>) offers an eight-day trip to Hudson Bay, Canada, staying in a remote luxury lodge on the Seal River Estuary. Boat trips and kayaking allow close encounters with belugas ,while hydrophones pick up their underwater singing. Also included on the itinerary is some excellent polar bear viewing. From &#163;8,495 per person, excluding international flights. Departs summer 2021.</b></p>

<h3>Atlantic puffin, Farne Islands</h3>
<p>Feathers may not be as cuddly as fur, buts ome birds have a universal appeal &#8211; and none more so than the Atlantic puffin. Posing beside its burrow in clown&#8217;s face and dapper tuxedo, this portly seabird seems designed for children&#8217;s toys and cartoons. And with a line of fish dangling from that outrageously colourful beak, its perplexed expression is irresistible. Sea-cliff colonies of this species &#8211; one of three puffins worldwide &#8211; are popular tourist attractions from Iceland to Newfoundland. You needn&#8217;t travel that far, however. Britain also has plenty, including on Northumberland&#8217;s Farne Islands, where close encounters are guaranteed during the April-July breeding season.</p>
<p><b>Billy Shiel&#8217;s Boat Trips (01665 720308; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.farne-islands.com" target="_blank">farne-islands.com</a>) has been operating cruises to the Farne Islands since 1918. As well as puffins, visitors during the breeding season will see seals and numerous other seabirds, including arctic terns. A variety of day trips are available, costing from &#163;20 per person.</b></p>

<h3>Dik-dik, Tanzania</h3>
<p>Hoofed mammals don&#8217;t generally featurein cuteness pageants. However, this tiny antelope has irresistible Bambi appeal with its pencil-thin legs, soulful eyes, huge ears and Mr Tumnushorns, while that tiny, twitchy trunk of a nose adds a signature quirkiness. The name dik-dik (don&#8217;t snigger) derives from the female&#8217;s alarm call. Four species inhabit thorn bush in east and south-west Africa, with Kirk&#8217;s dik-dik the most common. All form close-knit pairs, marking their territory by pasting a sticky secretion on grass from their preorbital gland &#8211; that smudge of eyeliner in front of the eye. Fair game for a legion of predators, dik-diks have mastered the art of hiding in plain sight. Spot one, however, and you can often get close.</p>
<p><b>Rainbow Tours (020 7666 1250; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rainbowtours.co.uk" target="_blank">rainbowtours.co.uk</a>) offers a 10-day Tanzania itinerary.

<h3>Slender loris, Sri Lanka</h3>
<p>As dusk falls over Sri Lanka&#8217;s tropical forests, this diminutive primate takes to the treetops. A tailless relative of Africa&#8217;s bush babies, it moves deliberately on long, slender limbs in search of insects, while those two enormous, moon eyes wear an endearing expression of permanent astonishment. Sri Lanka has two species: the endangered red slender loris and the more common grey loris. The latter often frequents forest stands in cultivated areas and even hotel gardens. By day, slender lorises snuggle up inside their tree-trunk roosts in family clusters of up to seven &#8211; not something you can see, but nonetheless nice to imagine.</p>
<p><b>Jetwing Vil Uyana (0094 114 709400; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jetwinghotels.com/jetwingviluyana" target="_blank">jetwinghotels.com/jetwingviluyana</a>) is offering a seven-night stay at Vil Uyana luxury eco-resort at the heart of SriLanka&#8217;s cultural triangle, with guided walks to see grey slender lorises in the grounds. Also included are visits to Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa and other&#160;cultural sites, plus village tours and a guided safari to Minneriya National Park. From &#163;1,737 per person for two people sharing, including full board and guided activities. Excludes international flights.</b></p>

<h3>Sea otter, Alaska</h3>
<p>Nothing is furrier than a sea otter. Forget teddy bears and chinchillas, this charming sea mammal has an astonishing 150,000 hairs per square centimetre of its luxuriant pelt. This keeps it warm in the frigid waters of the North Pacific. Indeed, with a mother&#8217;s constant grooming, a baby&#8217;s fur traps so much air that it is unable to sink. Maternal devotion is partly what makes sea otters so appealing, as they float on their back, cuddling their infants and sometimes even holding hands.</p>
<p><b>Hurtigruten (020 3603 7112;&#160;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hurtigruten.co.uk" target="_blank">hurtigruten.co.uk</a>) offers a 14-day Alaska and British Columbia cruise between Vancouver and Anchorage.

And Honda has the Ridgeline.

OK, maybe the Ridgeline isn't the world's most intimidating truck. It has more of the personality -- and the engineering -- of a toughened up crossover SUV with a cargo bed.

Honda's getting sick of always being Mr. Nice Guy, though. So, for starters, the company just unveiled a redesigned Ridgeline with a bigger, mouthier grill.

Even that weird "Bing-bong!" doorbell tone that precedes every Honda TV ad is getting a remix as part of a new ad campaign.

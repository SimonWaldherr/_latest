(CNN) "Emily in Paris" has drawn harsh criticism from some French viewers who say the Netflix comedy series plays up dated clichés about life in city of lights.

So, the language learning service Babbel surveyed more than 38,000 Parisians about the films and TV shows they think most accurately depict their beloved city and its residents. Respondents determined that the five best English-language on-screen representations of Paris are the 2011 film "Midnight in Paris," followed by 2007s "Ratatouille."

Despite the hate, "Emily in Paris" actually landed in third place; fourth was "The Aristocats" from 1970. "Julie & Julia" landed in fifth place. Just two percent of Parisians said that they had never seen an English-language film or TV show that reflected their perception of the city, according to Babbel.

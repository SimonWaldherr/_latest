  Steelworkers union projects Biden-Harris logo on side on Chicago's Trump Tower 
description: > 
  The United Steelworkers union trolled President Trump over the weekend when it used a “bat light” to project a giant campaign logo for former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., onto the side of Trump Tower in downtown Chicago.In photos taken on Saturday evening, a giant blue Biden/Harris logo is seen projected onto the side of the skyscraper just above Trump’s own name on his building.The United Steelworkers endorsed Biden’s candidacy back in May and have been using their “bat light” to project the Biden/Harris logo on the side of a number of Chicago landmarks in recent weeks, including Wrigley Field and the Chicago Theatre.The union's use of "bat light" is a play off of the 'bat signal' from the Batman comics and films.In addition to public polling that indicates Biden has an edge, the former vice president enjoys another considerable advantage over Trump: money.

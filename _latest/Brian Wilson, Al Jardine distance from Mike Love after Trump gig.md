<div><p>Former <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/the-beach-boys/">Beach Boys</a> Brian Wilson and Al Jardine say they want to make one thing clear &#8212; they had nothing to do with ex-bandmate Mike Love&#8217;s headlining performance at a Trump fundraiser over the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t even know about it and were very surprised to read about it in the Los Angeles Times,&#8217;&#8217; the pair said through a rep <a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/brian-wilson-al-jardine-trump-benefit-beach-boys-disavow-california-mike-love-1234808907/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to Variety</a> &#8212; referring to Love&#8217;s appearance with his &#8220;Beach Boys&#8217;&#8217; group on behalf of President Trump in Newport Beach, Calif., on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have absolutely nothing to do with the Trump benefit today in Newport Beach. Zero,&#8217;&#8217; the musicians said.</p>
<p>Love has the touring rights to the Beach Boys name &#8212; which has created controversy with his ex-bandmates in the past.</p>
<p>Wilson, a one-time star of the former mop-topped surfer-boy band, and ex-group singer and guitarist Jardine disavowed Love&#8217;s &#8220;Beach Boys&#8217;&#8217; group in February when it performed for an international safari convention. The president&#8217;s son, Donald Trump Jr., was the keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Wilson and Jardine, who sometimes still play together, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/it-s-time-to-stop-trophy-hunting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started a protest change.org petition</a> urging people to boycott the convention appearance.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;This organization supports trophy hunting, which both Al and I are emphatically opposed to,&#8221; Wilson said, referring to the safari club holding the convention, at the time. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing we can do personally to stop the show, so please join us in signing the petition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Love&#8217;s performance on behalf of President Trump on Sunday was the main attraction for the event, according to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-18/trump-fundraiser-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the LA Times.</a> Tickets ran from $2,800 per person to up to $150,000 for a couple to be considered &#8220;co-chairs&#8217;&#8217; of the event.</p>
<p>Lead singer Love has been a longtime Trump supporter.</p>
<p>He sang at one of the president&#8217;s inaugural balls in 2017, <a href="https://www.uncut.co.uk/news/beach-boys-mike-love-donald-trump-never-anything-kind-us-99571/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">telling Uncut magazine</a> afterward, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything negative to say about the president of the USA.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand there are so many factions and fractious things going on. The chips will fall where they may,&#8217;&#8217; Love said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Donald Trump has never been anything but kind to us. We have known him for many a year.&#8217;&#8217;</p>

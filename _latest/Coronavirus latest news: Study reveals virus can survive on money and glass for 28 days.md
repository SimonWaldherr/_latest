  The virus that causes Covid-19 can survive on banknotes, glass and stainless steel for up to 28 days - much longer than the flu - Australian researchers said on Monday, highlighting the need for cleaning and handwashing to combat the virus.Findings from the study by Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, show that in a controlled environment the virus remained infectious for longer than other studies have found.CSIRO researchers found that at 20C (68 degrees Fahrenheit) the virus remained infectious for 28 days on smooth surfaces such as plastic banknotes and glass on mobile phone screens.Experiments done at 20C, 30C and 40C showed the virus survived longer at cooler temperatures; longer on smooth surfaces than on complex surfaces such as cotton; and longer on paper banknotes than plastic banknotes.Follow the latest updates below.

The virus that causes Covid-19 can survive on banknotes, glass and stainless steel for up to 28 days - much longer than the flu - Australian researchers said on Monday, highlighting the need for cleaning and handwashing to combat the virus.

Findings from the study by Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, show that in a controlled environment the virus remained infectious for longer than other studies have found.

CSIRO researchers found that at 20C (68 degrees Fahrenheit) the virus remained infectious for 28 days on smooth surfaces such as plastic banknotes and glass on mobile phone screens.

Experiments done at 20C, 30C and 40C showed the virus survived longer at cooler temperatures; longer on smooth surfaces than on complex surfaces such as cotton; and longer on paper banknotes than plastic banknotes.

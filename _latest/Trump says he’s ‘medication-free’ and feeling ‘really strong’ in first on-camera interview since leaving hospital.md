Donald Trump said he was feeling "really, really strong" in his first on-camera interview since testing positive for Covid-19 last week.

Speaking to Dr Marc Siegel on Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight , the president said he was "medication-free" as of Friday and feeling "strong".

In the interview — which took place shortly after the second presidential debate was cancelled — Mr Trump also said he had been retested for the coronavirus but was not clear whether he had learned the result. He did however claim to know he was likely free from the virus.

Asked by Dr Siegel how he felt when in hospital for the virus, the president responded: "It was just, you were tired ... you didn't have that same energy level.

"My life is based a little bit on energy and you didn't have it.

"It could have led to bad things from that point, I don't know, I think I got lucky with a certain medicine."

The president attributed his recovery to Regeneron, a drug still in trial phase. Medical experts have pointed out that the drug is too early in testing to confirm whether it is an effective treatment for Covid-19.

"I took the Regeneron ... within a period of about 24 hours I felt very different. I think I could have left the hospital a lot earlier."

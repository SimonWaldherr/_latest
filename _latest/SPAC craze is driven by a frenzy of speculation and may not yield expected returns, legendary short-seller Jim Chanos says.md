<p>The boom in SPACs&#160;is driven by heavy speculation and may not produce expected returns, as these investment vehicles don&#8217;t perform well historically, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-20/blank-check-company-deals-driven-by-speculation-chanos-says">Bloomberg reported</a> short-seller Jim Chanos as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to blow through the records of 1999 and 2000 in terms of new issuance,&#8221; Chanos said at a conference in New York on Tuesday. &#8220;We are now seeing speculation in all its glory come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>SPACs, special purpose acquisition companies, are also known as &#8220;blank check&#8221; companies, and are created specifically to take a company public, without going through the traditional process for an initial public offering. Their use has exploded this year.&#160;</p>
<p>Chanos, who made his name forecasting the downfall of US energy giant Enron, said &#8220;academic work has showed us that the return of special purpose acquisition companies is not only bad relative to the stock market, it&#8217;s even worse than initial public offerings. That hasn&#8217;t stopped people from getting excited and throwing money.&#8221;</p><p id="in-content-mobile-streamad-slot"></p>
<p>Chanos, also the founder of New York-based investment management firm Kynikos Associates, said companies are, wrongly, setting aside metrics such as revenue and earnings, and focusing instead on the overall market size they can gain.</p><p id="in-content-dekstop-streamad-slot"></p><p id="ad7-container">

<p>The problem, Chanos said, is looking at &#8220;how big is what you&#8217;re chasing, forgetting for a second that everybody else is chasing those same markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to the example of video-streaming pioneer <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nflx-stock">Netflix</a> which believes its total market is &#8220;all the people on the planet.&#8221; The company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-q3-2020-earnings-analysis-subscribers-esp-2020-10">fell short of subscriber-growth targets</a> in the third-quarter after initially posting a massive growth spurt earlier this year.&#160;</p><p id="div-gpt-ad-25613-7" class="ad-container-in-content"></p>
 

<p>Chanos joked that he would &#8220;go long any of the space companies that have gone public because we know that space is infinite. There&#8217;s no price too high to pay.&#8221;</p>

Continuing to social distance leaves us with a lot of time on our sanitized hands. Thankfully, television is here to offer a distraction.

Our calendar of major highlights ensures you won't miss the return of your favorite series or the start of a new show you'll fall in love with. (All times EDT/PDT.)

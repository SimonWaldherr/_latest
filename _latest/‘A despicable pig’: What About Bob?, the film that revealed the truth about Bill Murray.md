“Richard Dreyfuss really understood that role,” says Schulman. “There’s a moment where he’s driving Bob back from the mental institution and throws Bob out of the car. Richard can’t even say the lines because he’s so angry. Richard really got into it.”

It was a reaction, perhaps, to the real-life tension. Speaking in a 1991 interview, Murray described some tactics he employed to needle Dreyfuss: “While he was talking, I got real close to crowd him. I put my head on his shoulder, screamed into his ear and did all sorts of annoying things. Some of that was even in script… No wait, none of that was in the script. I made it all up.”

The film was shot in 1990 in Moneta, Virginia. According to Frank Oz, production was “incredibly difficult, incredibly full of tension”. The director said: “I was really scared to death that we had a piece of s–––, because it was so impossible to judge it.”

To break up the boredom of production, Bill Murray took the entire of fifty-odd people to a nearby MC Hammer concert (it was 1990, after all). They drank Moonshine and Murray estimated he drank “four or five ounces of 190 proof alcohol”. When Hammer played U Can’t Touch This, Murray joined him on stage and busted out the Hammer dance. “That’s right, the Hammer dance,” Murray said in a 2004 interview. “Surprisingly, I knew all the steps. But I learned why he wore those weird chef’s pants, because I split my pants right up the back. And since it was the end of the month off on a remote location, all I had was my pants. I was going commando, if you know what I mean. I was working without a net.”

As one oft-repeated story goes, Murray threw Laura Ziskin in the lake after an argument. “Bill also threatened to throw me across the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot,” Ziskin said. Tom Schulman doubts that Murray really threw her in the lake, but he remembers hearing from Ziskin about the friction between Murray and Dreyfuss. “I heard the same stories you did,” he tells me. “There was a constant battle about how the movie was going to end. I think Bill and Richard didn’t agree on that. That created some tension. I heard they had a meeting to talk about the ending because they disagreed and things got pretty heated.”

Talking in 2012, Frank Oz recalled creative differences between himself, writer, producer, Murray, Dreyfuss, and Disney. “Everybody had their own viewpoint on how to make the movie better,” said Oz. Schulman recalls that Oz and Disney wanted a happy ending, in which everybody makes friends. “Someone said if Bob and the psychiatrist had been a man and a woman they’d have kissed and made up at the end,” says Schulman. “My strong feeling was that it wasn’t going to work. They shot that ending and shot the ending we have now, and did test screenings of both. The one that’s on the movie is the one that worked...”

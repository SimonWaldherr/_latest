This week’s new Covid restrictions mentioned little about cinemas. As long as screenings begin before 10pm, and food and drink isn’t served after that time, no problem. Nothing drastically new, then, on top of the measures (social distancing, face-masks) already in place?

Within hours, there were casualties. A five-day October event for the horror film festival FrightFest, at Leicester Square’s Cineworld, was promptly killed. “Everything that makes FrightFest FrightFest is being stripped away by Covid restrictions”, tweeted Ian Rattray, one of the festival’s founders, on Wednesday afternoon. A couple of hours later, London’s Peckhamplex cinema announced “with great sadness” that it would be closing – again – until November. The rising R number has hit hard.

The industry has been on a knife-edge since Covid regulations transformed Britain in March. An early irony is that cinema, perpetually discussed as if it’s in a constant state of jeopardy, was in rude health. “It’s been a very strange period”, says Oliver Meek, executive director of Dalston’s Rio Cinema. “At the end of February we had our most successful month of all time. Parasite did incredibly well. And then things crashed down.”

Jason Wood, creative director of Manchester’s HOME arts complex, concurs that “lockdown came at a very inopportune time. We’d just had our best-ever period – we had record admissions for Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Uncut Gems – we were absolutely packed. And then the lockdown took the wind out of our sails.”

As the industry came to terms with it all, with the furloughing, with the funding, with the online appeals for donations, staff began to realise that when things did get going again, it would not be business as usual.

When cinemas were allowed to re-open, a new landscape was quickly created. Seats were either taped off or removed completely to enable social distancing, and peculiar new routines were introduced. It has come at a cost. “Because of the extra safety measures, we need more staff than we did before, not less,” says Meek.

“Checking people’s temperature on the door, checking they’re wearing masks, track and trace, limiting the amount of people that come through…” Audiences, though, took to it easily, and enthusiasm among cinemagoers has been a balm – and, to many businesses fearing the worst, a lifesaver.

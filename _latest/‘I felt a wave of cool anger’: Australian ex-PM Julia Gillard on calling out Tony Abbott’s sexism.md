In hindsight, and of course hindsight’s a wonderful thing, it would have been better to raise all the sexist insults that happened to me earlier on in my prime ministership. Politics is a pretty tough game, but I was being called a ‘bitch’ and a ‘menopausal monster’, and there was a consistent attempt to frame me as ultra-ambitious and heartless by the opposition and some in the media. I thought it would abate and I would start being treated like any other prime minister, but I found that the gendered treatment got worse over time.

My famous misogyny speech came on a day dominated by news that the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Peter Slipper, had been accused of sending sexist texts to an aide. My government had supported his appointment a year before.

Even though I could not have known about these text messages at the time, I suspected there would be an attempt in question time to skewer me for being hypocritical. I walked into the chamber already feeling a wave of cool anger that, after all I had been through, now this tactic was going to be used against me. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, who had stood in front of campaign signs saying ‘Ditch the witch’, was now going to try and paint me as a supporter of sexism!

Instead of asking questions, Abbott moved a motion of censure. I hadn’t expected or prepared to give a speech, but had brought some of Abbott’s sexist quotes with me. So while he was talking, I jotted down a few words to order my thoughts and then I stood for 15 minutes calling out his sexism and his double standards. I told him, ‘The Leader of the Opposition says that people who hold sexist views and who are misogynists are not appropriate for high office. Well I hope the Leader of the Opposition has got a piece of paper and he is writing out his resignation. Because if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn’t need a motion in the House of Representatives, he needs a mirror.’

I had no idea that the speech would go viral but I’ve done a lot of speeches in my life and could tell it was landing. Abbott and the opposition, who were initially interrupting and calling out, grew quieter as I went on.

By the time I walked back to the office after the debate, people were calling to congratulate me. My speech resonated with the public, although the press gallery thought that it had been inappropriate and might ‘alienate men’. They were in a Canberra bubble, whereas everyone else – at home and around the world – saw it as a woman holding her ground and responded to it as a clarion call about gender in politics.

Long term, I didn’t get any more respect from politicians or the press. Although the speech is now looked on as an important call round an issue the nation needed to address, it wasn’t viewed like that at the time. Nowadays, the conversation is very different, people are more likely to call out sexism and I like to think my speech played a small part in this.

When I heard that I had gone viral on TikTok, with young women re-enacting my speech, I was really pleased. I love the fact my words are rallying them to fight for gender equality.

I hope my new book, Women and Leadership, will also help women, especially those building their careers. We [co-author economist and international development expert Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala] get asked by hundreds of women to mentor them and it’s just not possible, so we hope by sharing some of our life experience and that of eight global women leaders we can do our bit to help.

We were a minority government who enacted some nation-changing reforms but despite that, I will always be most remembered for that day. Initially, when I left politics, it was all anyone wanted to talk to me about and there was a modicum of resentment there – after all, I was Prime Minister and did a lot more than just give one speech! But I’m now at peace with it because gender equality is very important to me.

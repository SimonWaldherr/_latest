description: > 
  As things stand, Greater Manchester will be forced into tier three on Friday, against the wishes of local leaders, after talks over a financial support package collapsed.Right now, the region will get £22m, but the government says an offer of £60m "remains on the table".Six local Conservative MPs have written to Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who said the £60m offer was too low, accusing him of putting his ego above people's best interests.The situation certainly looks like a political failure, says the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.Meanwhile, talks continue later about whether South Yorkshire will be next to enter the "very high" alert level.

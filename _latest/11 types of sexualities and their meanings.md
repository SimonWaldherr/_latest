In June, the Supreme Court decided that antidiscrimination employment protections apply to those who identify as LGBT.

That means that you cannot be discriminated against by your employer for your sexual identity.

According to sexuality educator, writer, and consultant Jamie LeClaire, sexual identity is the "gender that you are attracted to, or if you are interested in sex at all."

Beyond heterosexual and gay, there's a wide variety of sexual identities and terms people may identify with.

Sexual identity itself is a relatively new construct historically — and it's a contentious subject with some scholars. However, it can also offer a sense of community, particularly with the rise of social media.

There's a wide array of sexual orientations that someone may identify with.

Sexual identity, or orientation, is the "gender that you are attracted to, or if you are interested in sex at all," Jamie LeClaire, a sexuality educator, writer, and consultant, told Business Insider.

In the United States, the LGBT population — and the mainstream acceptance of this community — is only growing. Gallup estimated that the percentage of Americans who identify as LGBT was 4.5% in 2017, while 8.1% of millennials self-identified as LGBT.

In June, the Supreme Court decided that antidiscrimination employment protections apply to those within the LGBT umbrella — meaning that your employer cannot discriminate against you for your sexual identity.

More recently, as NPR reports, Supreme Court Justices Thomas Alito and Clarence Thomas "issued a broadside against the high court's 2015 same-sex marriage decision," which caused worry among some members of the LGBT community.

This rising awareness, coupled with the reach of social media and ever-increasing visibility, has led to more mainstream recognition of different sexual identities outside of just "gay" or "straight." But even within those categories, there's a variety of different terms people identify with.

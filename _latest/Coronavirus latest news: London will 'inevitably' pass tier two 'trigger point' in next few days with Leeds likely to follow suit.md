It is "inevitable" that London will pass a "trigger point" to enter a higher tier of coronavirus restrictions in the "next few days", Sadiq Khan has said.

The Mayor of London said he was "angry" with the Government for having redeployed tests away from the capital, as this meant there was a less accurate understanding of the transmission rate, although he estimated it at around 90 per 100,000.

Other indicators including hospitalisations were "going in the wrong direction", he said.

"Which means, I'm afraid, it's inevitable over the course of the next few days London will have passed a trigger point to be in the second tier," Mr Khan told Sky News.

Council leaders across the city were "keen to go as one" to avoid "the complexities and the confusion" of having different rules, he added.

"Many Londoners work in one borough, live in another borough, study in another borough, go to a restaurant in another borough so we're really keen to go as one city."

Meanwhile council leaders in Leeds have said that the city is on a Government "watchlist" and could be placed under the highest coronavirus alert level as they enter further negotiations.

Councillors in the city - which has been placed in the Tier 2 "high" category - said they believe the Government's preference would be for more regions to follow the Liverpool City Region into Tier 3.

They said discussions with the Government are continuing and they will be looking for an extra package of support for businesses in the city.

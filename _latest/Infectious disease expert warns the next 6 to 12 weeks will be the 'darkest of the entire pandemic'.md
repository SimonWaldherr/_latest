  Infectious disease expert warns the next 6 to 12 weeks will be the 'darkest of the entire pandemic' 
description: > 
  Michael Osterholm, a renowned infectious disease expert, warned that the next several months will be the 'darkest of the entire pandemic.'When asked about the White House's controversial push towards herd immunity, Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, admitted he didn't share the administration's optimism.Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top infectious disease expert on the task force, publicly bumped heads over various issues.The pair's most recent clash came over herd immunity, which was reportedly proposed to Trump by medical adviser Scott Atlas.Atlas falsely claimed that herd immunity could be achieved once 20 to 40 per cent of Americans were infected.

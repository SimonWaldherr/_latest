<div><p>Bizarrely, Die Another Day grossed $432 million worldwide, making it the biggest cash cow of the Brosnan Bonds. This is partly to be explained by the presence of Halle Berry at the peak of her fame &#8211; indeed, the same year she won the Best Actress Oscar (unsurprisingly, not for Die Another Day).</p>
<p>How bad does a film need to be, to make that amount of money, and still get accused of almost killing off its franchise forever? The answers are in the last couple of reels here. The cat-fighty set-to between Berry&#8217;s Jinx and Rosamund Pike&#8217;s laughable Miranda Frost &#8211; with its &#8220;read this, bitch!&#8221; payoff &#8211; is grim and lamentable. I regularly forget that Toby Stephens is in this film, still less playing the main villain.</p>
<p>It was a constant weak spot of the Brosnan Bonds that they had such feeble male baddies. The one everyone talks about most fondly is GoldenEye, often because they got hooked for years afterwards on the excellent N64 first-person shooter. I can take or leave the film, but one thing&#8217;s for sure &#8211; Sean Bean, as stolid Bond-a-like Alec Trevelyan, isn&#8217;t fit to lick the kinky boots of Famke Janssen&#8217;s Xenia Onatopp.&#160;</p>
<p>Moving on down to the boring sets of Tomorrow Never Dies, which is so sexless and mechanical &#8211; very much the silver BMW of Bonds &#8211; we get Jonathan Pryce&#8217;s ineffectual media baron Elliot Carver, who has &#8220;seemed like a bright idea on the page&#8221; written all over him.</p>

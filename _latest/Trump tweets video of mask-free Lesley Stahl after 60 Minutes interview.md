<div><p>WASHINGTON &#8212; President Trump on Tuesday tweeted a video of a mask-free &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; anchor Lesley Stahl which was taken following a White House interview he reportedly stormed out of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me. Much more to come,&#8221; the <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1318644698341408769" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">president tweeted</a> to his 87 million followers.</p>
<p>In the six-second clip, Stahl can be seen smiling and speaking with two unidentified masked men while holding a stack of papers and notes in front of her chest. It&#8217;s unclear if Stahl knew she was being filmed or who took the video.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/20/politics/trump-interview-60-minutes/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a CNN report</a>, the commander-in-chief abruptly stormed out of the interview with Stahl after about 45 minutes of questioning.</p>
<p>The president was also meant to appear with Vice President Mike Pence but did not return to the room when his veep arrived, the report said.</p>
<p>The crisis grew when White House Assistant Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly accused Stahl of criticizing her for not wearing a mask in the West Wing.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is moments after she criticized me for not wearing a mask while working at my desk. Rules for thee but not for me, Lesley?&#8221; Leavitt <a href="https://twitter.com/KLeavitt45/status/1318656107225690116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in a tweet</a> sharing the video.</p>
<p>A New York Times report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/elections/trump-lesley-stahl-60-minutes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published Tuesday evening</a> said that the president cut the interview short when he became irritated with Stahl&#8217;s questioning, citing two people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>Trump also ended the interview when it ran longer than his aides expected it to, the report said.</p>
<p>Both Democratic nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris were also interviewed by &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; with all of the sit-downs meant to air on Sunday &#8212; just nine days ahead of the presidential election on Nov. 3.</p>
<p>Reporters granted interviews with Trump and Pence are tested for the coronavirus before they are allowed to be in the same room as them as part of the White House&#8217;s COVID-19 containment measures.</p>

<p>Trump has since recovered after <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/07/trump-calls-covid-19-diagnosis-a-blessing-from-god-in-new-video/">testing positive for the disease</a> earlier this month. Stahl also contracted the virus and was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/769245622a72c240d9a6bcbe6b0294c9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hospitalized for a week</a>.</p>
<p>In a clip <a href="https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1317979054654558208" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promoting the upcoming interviews</a>, the veteran broadcaster promised &#8220;revealing, provocative conversations&#8221; with both candidates.</p>
<p>The pair last met for a contentious interview in 2018 where the &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; anchor pressed Trump on his views on climate change and Russian interference in the 2016 election but the president finished the interview.</p>

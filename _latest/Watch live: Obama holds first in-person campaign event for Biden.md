<p>Pennsylvania swung to support Mr. Trump in 2016, and is considered a must-win state by the Biden campaign. Both candidates are spending significant resources in the state. Mr. Trump appeared at a rally in Erie on Tuesday evening, where he told supporters that he was only visiting because his campaign had been hampered by the pandemic.</p><p>"Four or five months ago when we started this whole thing &#8212; because, you know, before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn't coming to Erie," Mr. Trump said. "And then we got hit with the plague, and I had to go back to work. 'Hello, Erie, may I please have your vote?' Right?"</p><p></p></div>

  Noah Cyrus sizzles in TWO looks as she hits the stage in nearly naked sheer look at CMT Music Awards 
description: > 
  She put her taut midriff on display in head-to-toe denim, before hitting the stage in a nearly naked sheer look, as she appeared Wednesday at the CMT Music Awards in Nashville.She complemented the look with a stitched denim stetson, high-waisted patchwork denim pants and dark denim stiletto boots with black leather tips.The End of Everything artist left little to the imagination in a see-through nude sheer bodysuit with a silver jeweled bra and panty design.She wore her cascading black hair in a white stetson with matching silver jewels, complemented with long white jeweled gloves and knee-high white leather stilettos with jeweled straps around the ankle.The CMT Music Awards are normally held in the summer, but the show was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

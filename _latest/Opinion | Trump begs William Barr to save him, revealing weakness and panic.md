Trump is practically pleading with Barr to salvage his reelection hopes, right there on national television.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump has been trying to manufacture narratives of corruption on the part of the Bidens for years. Each iteration has crashed and burned.</p><p><h3 class="font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod">Big holes in this &#8216;scandal&#8217;</h3></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">So far, this latest one doesn&#8217;t appear to be an exception. An email on the hard drive of a laptop that Hunter Biden allegedly left at a Delaware computer repair store is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/15/trumps-fake-new-biden-scandal-has-deeper-purpose-bannon-revealed-it/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13" target="_blank">supposed to show</a> that he arranged a meeting with his then-vice president father for an official at Burisma, which paid Hunter Biden to sit on its board.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">But the authenticity of the email and Hunter Biden&#8217;s onetime ownership of the laptop both remain unverified. Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, the story&#8217;s original source, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hunter-joe-biden-emails/2020/10/14/2740c702-0e4c-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_15">declined to provide The Washington Post with the hard drive</a>, and he has since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/business/media/new-york-post-hunter-biden.html">admitted</a> he gave it to the New York Post because he didn&#8217;t think that outlet would seriously scrutinize it.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">What&#8217;s more, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-examining-hunter-bidens-laptop-as-foreign-op-contradicting-john-ratcliffe-trumps-intel-czar">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/16/politics/russian-disinformation-investigation/index.html">news</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-russia-024b553e9a4ffb2716286dd134876f8a">outlets</a> have now reported that the FBI is examining whether the material from Hunter Biden (which supposedly includes salacious stuff) is linked to a Russian disinformation effort. Intelligence officials had previously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/giuliani-biden-ukraine-russian-disinformation/2020/10/15/43158900-0ef5-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_17">warned that Giuliani is a conduit</a> for such disinformation.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Even if the email turns out to be real, it&#8217;s not at all clear it would be scandalous. Joe Biden&#8217;s campaign says no such meeting ever happened. And the whole premise here is nonsense: This meeting is being cast as part of a broader story in which Biden abused his official powers to protect Burisma and his son&#8217;s business interests, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/27/quick-guide-trumps-false-claims-about-ukraine-bidens/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18">that&#8217;s also pure fiction</a>.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump&#8217;s call for a special prosecutor is also deeply absurd, since Hunter Biden is a private citizen. But we can assume that Trump just wants Barr to <i>announce</i> some sort of investigation into this matter &#8212; just as he tried to strong-arm the Ukrainian president into doing, getting himself impeached &#8212; to cast a vague aura of corruption on the Bidens.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">And even here, this will likely end up demonstrating weakness and panic on Trump&#8217;s part more than anything else. After all, on one front after another, previous efforts to corruptly use the government toward this end have collapsed.</p><p><h3 class="font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod">Nothing but fail</h3></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump had hoped that a phony investigation run by his GOP Senate colleagues would smear the Bidens. But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/23/gops-own-star-witness-just-blew-up-trumps-huntergazi-smear/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24">its final report only further confirmed</a> what we already know: Biden helped oust a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor in keeping with a policy backed by international institutions that had nothing to do with Burisma.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">On other fronts, Trump&#8217;s scheme to push through a vaccine before the election fell apart when his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/08/trump-just-said-corrupt-part-out-loud-with-bullhorn/?itid=lk_inline_manual_26" target="_blank">brazen advertising of his designs</a> led other stakeholders to insist on a careful, uncorrupted process. And precisely because he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/31/trump-just-told-us-how-mail-delays-could-help-him-corrupt-election/?itid=lk_inline_manual_26" target="_blank">telegraphed his corrupt plot</a> to try to invalidate millions of mail ballots, unprecedented numbers are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/15/surprise-huge-early-vote-bodes-well-avoiding-electoral-disaster/?itid=lk_inline_manual_26" target="_blank">voting early, making that less likely</a>.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Meanwhile, even Barr has failed Trump. Barr <a href="https://www.axios.com/barr-durham-report-election-3c02ec6a-7613-4083-b35c-4844de6da16b.html">recently told Republicans</a> that he will likely not release any report on his &#8220;review&#8221; designed to cast doubt on the investigation confirming that Russia sabotaged the 2016 election on Trump&#8217;s behalf.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/09/trump-hits-barr-russia-probe-bombshells-428355">raged at that Barr failing</a> as a &#8220;disgrace.&#8221; And he&#8217;s plainly in a fury over all this failure: On Monday he unloaded on a reporter, <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1318263530517385220">calling him</a> a &#8220;criminal&#8221; for the mere act of not uncritically amplifying the Hunter Biden story he has staked so much upon.</p><p><h3 class="font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod">Trump sees unabashed corruption as strength</h3></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Only hours before Trump demanded that Barr investigate the Hunter Biden affair, a new poll was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/biden-trump-times-poll.html">released by the New York Times and Siena College</a> finding Biden leading nationally by 50 percent to 41 percent. The <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/">national averages</a> put Biden up by 10.5 points.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The new Times-Siena poll also showed Trump losing the argument in every way: A majority doesn&#8217;t believe his central campaign claim that the worst of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_34" target="_blank" class="contextual_link">coronavirus</a> is behind us; Biden holds a lopsided advantage on that issue, and Trump&#8217;s vaunted edge on the economy has vanished.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Yet for Trump, it&#8217;s obvious that he equates his naked displays of corruption with shows of strength. Tellingly, in <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1318539070956593154">the &#8220;Fox &amp; Friends&#8221; appearance</a>, he immediately pivoted from demanding that investigation into declaring that &#8220;we&#8217;re doing very well&#8221; in the campaign.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The game here is to use this new pseudo-scandal to convince supporters that Trump is <i>on offense</i>, that he&#8217;s <i>finally got the Bidens where he wants them</i>, to distract from his travails. But, while a Trump victory is still possible, right now this signals panic more than anything else.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><b>Read more</b>:</p></div>

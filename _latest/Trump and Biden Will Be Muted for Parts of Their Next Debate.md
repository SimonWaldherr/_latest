  Trump and Biden Will Be Muted for Parts of Their Next Debate 
description: > 
  The moderator of Thursday’s debate in Nashville, Kristen Welker of NBC News, will not be in control of turning the candidates’ microphones on and off; that task will be left to the commission’s production crew.There is also the potential for a new kind of gaffe: Mr. Trump’s voice may be picked up by Mr. Biden’s microphone, and vice versa, meaning that an attempted interruption may still be heard, at least faintly, by viewers watching at home.Mr. Trump and his aides have signaled deep hostility to any outside control of his microphone at the debate, even sending a belligerent letter to the commission calling it “completely unacceptable” for “an unnamed person” to shut off a microphone.Late Monday, Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One, “I just think it is very unfair,” according to a pool report.He added, “It is very unfair that again we have an anchor who is totally biased.”

    <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In a statement, the commission said it had acted out of concern that the first debate had fallen short, &#8220;depriving voters of the opportunity to be informed of the candidates&#8217; positions on the issues.&#8221; But it also acknowledged that the two campaigns, which were notified only shortly before the announcement, might not &#8220;be totally satisfied.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;We are comfortable that these actions strike the right balance and that they are in the interest of the American people, for whom these debates are held,&#8221; the commission said.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Trump and his aides have signaled deep hostility to any outside control of his microphone at the debate, even sending a belligerent letter to the commission calling it &#8220;completely unacceptable&#8221; for &#8220;an unnamed person&#8221; to shut off a microphone.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Late Monday, Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One, &#8220;I just think it is very unfair,&#8221; according to a pool report.

Barnes/Associated Press</p><p class="">The Kansas City Chiefs improved to 5-1 with a 26-17 victory over the AFC East-leading Buffalo Bills.</p><p class="">With the win, the Chiefs now sit 1.5 games above the Las Vegas Raiders for first place in the AFC West.</p><p class="">This encounter was originally scheduled for Oct. 15 but&#160;<a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-ANNOUNCES-SCHEDULE-CHANGES.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moved to Monday night</a>&#160;because of fallout from positive COVID-19 tests across the league.</p><p class="">This was the first time Patrick Mahomes faced off against the Bills since Kansas City&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1317829751197863938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked out a deal</a>&#160;with Buffalo to trade up to the No. 10 pick in the 2017 <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nfl">NFL</a> draft.&#160;The Bills came away with All-Pro cornerback Tre'Davious White and 2019 Pro Bowler Tremaine Edmunds, but the Chiefs are already the winners thanks to last year's Super Bowl run.</p><p id="br-ad-17006701" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Monday's game will be another reminder of what might have been in Buffalo if the team bet on Mahomes instead of <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/josh-allen">Josh Allen</a> as its franchise quarterback.</p><p class="">The Chiefs running backs stole the show, though. Clyde Edwards-Helaire,&#160;Darrel Williams and Darwin Thompson combined to run for 204 yards on 35 carries. Williams' 13-yard touchdown run on fourth down in the third quarter was emblematic of Kansas City's dominance on the ground.</p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png">Video Play Button</a><p class="atom video-indicator"><p class="text">Videos you might like </p> </p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Notable Performers</strong></p><p class="">Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs:&#160;21-of-26, 225 yards, two touchdowns; 10 carries, 36 yards</p><p class="">Clyde Edwards-Helaire, RB, Chiefs:&#160;26 carries, 161 yards; four receptions, eight yards</p><p class="">Travis Kelce, TE, Chiefs:&#160;five receptions, 65 yards, two touchdowns</p><p class="">Josh Allen, QB, Bills:&#160;14-of-27, 122 yards, two touchdowns, one interception;&#160;eight carries, 42 yards</p><p class="">Stefon Diggs, WR, Bills:&#160;six receptions, 46 yards, one touchdown</p><p class="">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class=""><strong>Bills Have No Answer for Edwards-Helaire</strong></p><p class="">The <a href="https://twitter.com/diannaESPN/status/1318260465181642757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conditions</a> in Orchard Park, New York, were less than ideal. In addition to cooler temperatures, the players had to contend with steady rainfall.</p><p class="">Chiefs head coach Andy Reid adapted his game plan to heavily feature Edwards-Helaire since passing the ball proved a little more troublesome than usual for Mahomes. The former LSU star showed exactly why Kansas City used a first-round pick on him in April.</p><p class="">Reid didn't make many friends in the fantasy football world after Edwards-Helaire was unable to score on back-to-back trips to the red zone in the first half. He had one touchdown wiped off the board due to a holding penalty.</p><p class="">Travis Kelce, on the other hand, feasted in those situations and had a pair of touchdown grabs.</p><p id="br-ad-67918375" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Mahomes didn't look downfield too much and failed to have a completion of more than 37 yards. A two-time All-Pro tight end is a godsend when passing yards are hard to get in big chunks.</p><p class="">As a reminder, this is an offense that will also be <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30120515/rb-leveon-bell-expected-sign-kansas-city-chiefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding</a> Le'Veon Bell.

He was averaging 317.8 passing yards per game with 14 touchdowns to three interceptions.</p><p class="">Maybe the rainy weather was to blame for his off night, or Allen might be falling back to earth a bit.</p><p class="">His performance shouldn't obscure Buffalo's continued inability to stop opposing teams on defense.&#160;The Bills are <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/team-defense/2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">27th</a> in defensive efficiency, down from <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/team-defense/2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seventh</a> in 2019, per Football Outsiders. This loss isn't an outlier.</p><p class="">The Chiefs have torched plenty of teams over the past two-plus seasons, but they usually did so thanks to Mahomes and the aerial attack. Kansas City ran the ball at will, even with Mitchell Schwartz exiting early due to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Chiefs/status/1318302175999778821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back injury</a>.</p><p class="">The final score doesn't accurately portray the gulf that separated these teams;&#160;Kansas City out-gained Buffalo 466-206.&#160;The Chiefs were also 9-of-14 on third down.

One of the earliest poems written in English is the Dream of the Rood, conserved in the 10th century Vercelli Book, which tells the origin story of the cross on which Christ was crucified. In part the poem is narrated by the Rood, or 'upright post', which recounts how an enemy entered the forest and felled it, separating it from its companion trees before carrying it away to bear the saviour in his passion.

The Rood offers both a justification and a vindication for its felling, which at the time must have seemed a catastrophe.

Seven hundred years later Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, wrote A Dialogue between an 'Oake', and a 'Man cutting him downe', in which the oak tree argued the case against its felling most eloquently, as a result of which its life was spared. While a memorable few of Tolkien’s Ents in The Lord of the Rings retained their powers of speech, other trees grew dumb, anticipating the silence with which the erosion of our ancient forests has crept upon us. Not that the loss of our native woodland has gone unlamented.

Jan Morris eulogised the Basaleg oak, reputed to be the biggest tree in Britain which, after being admired by Lord Nelson in 1802, was transformed into ‘2,446 cubic feet of timber for the shipyards, then the most ever recorded from a single tree’.

Certain trees have won themselves favours, most famously the Boscobel Oak in Shropshire, although its fame served only to hasten its demise. The future Charles II had hidden from, and indeed spied upon, the Roundheads from its boughs, in consequence of which the original ‘Royal Oak’ lost so many of its branches to the pocket knives of sixteenth and seventeenth century tourists keen to acquire a relic that it died.

A two to three hundred year old ‘descendent’ of the Boscobel oak, known as ‘Son of Royal Oak’ can still be found near Boscobel House today, and a stout fence discourages trespassers.

Nowadays, what Morris called the ‘battleship oaks’ have been survived by twisted sessile oaks, although many of these were also felled, seemingly because they did no good.

In 1927 Hansard recorded the appropriately named Forestry Commissioner, Sir Leolin Forestier-Walker, responding to a plea from the people of Delamere to save their trees: "Practically all the good oaks in Delamere Forest were felled many years ago. Of the remaining trees, all of which are of very indifferent growth, not one per cent is sound, while many are dead and dying. In felling for replanting, amenity belts are left on the roadside wherever the oaks are good enough to stand."

I grew up living near to these ‘indifferent…dead and dying’, very much alive, roadside belts of Cheshire trees. They exuded a sense of mystery, of deep magic, and of legend which complimented my childhood reading: the tales of King Arthur, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and the stories of the Edge – Alderley Edge – and of North Wales, spun by the superb Alan Garner in The Weirdstone of Brasingamen and The Owl Service.

The woods were also home to the birds at our garden bird table: nuthatches, woodpeckers, greenfinches, collared doves, wood pigeons and more. The remaining Delamere oaks are still going strong (a sessile oak can live for 500 years or more), and still hugging the commercially planted pines like a deciduous toupé or combover.

The latest challenge to our ancient woodland is HS2, the UK's new high-speed rail network. In September the 300 year old Hunningham Oak near Leamington was felled as part of the development. At the time of writing, England’s ‘2015 Tree of the Year’, the 250 year old Cubbington Pear, was likewise awaiting the chainsaw, though a petition was underway to save it.

So what are we to do? "A small grove massacred to the last ash… This great society is going to smash", wrote W.H. Auden, adding: "A culture is no better than its woods’" In The Moth Snowstorm Michael McCarthy argued that we will only save the things we love.

I spent some time this summer searching out pockets of deciduous woodland around Haweswater in Cumbria. The vast RSPB reserve there embraces Naddle Forest where alder, ash, birch, wild cherry, hazels, holly, rowan, willow and – yes – sessile oak cloak the north eastern slopes of Haweswater.

The birds of my childhood were there among the trees, although no longer perhaps the greenfinch. Red squirrels, badgers and foxes are also thriving. We know so much more about our woodlands now.

About the mycorrhizal fungi which form the ‘wood wide web’, through which trees really can communicate with one another. Many thousands of trees are being planted, or are due to be planted, over the coming decades.

But our ancient woodlands are irreplaceable, their delicate systems of communication and interconnection, their mosses, their lichens, the forest floor, the canopy, systems finessed over countless millenia, so we should seek them, cherish them, and sustain them, even as they have sustained us.

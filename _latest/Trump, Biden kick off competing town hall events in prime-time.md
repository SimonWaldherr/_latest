The dueling town hall events between President Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden are underway, with the candidates vying for eyeballs and votes in separate prime-time appearances after a scheduled debate between them was scrapped.

Biden is addressing voters at Philadelphia’s National Constitution Center in a 90-minute affair airing on ABC.

Trump’s hour-long event, meanwhile, is airing on NBC, with the president courting voters in the Perez Art Museum in Miami >— the city that was originally set to host a second presidential debate on Thursday night.

Following Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis, the Commission on Presidential Debates ruled that the two candidates would debate remotely — a decision that caused Trump to pull out of the contest altogether.

Biden soon signed on to appear solo at the Philadelphia town hall, which is being moderated by ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Trump, meanwhile, agreed to headline a town hall of his own in Florida, refereed by NBC News journalist Savannah Guthrie.

The events are airing head-to-head, despite an open letter from over 100 Hollywood figures asking NBC to broadcast the Trump town hall either before or after Biden’s, to allow Americans to watch both and decide.

Both candidates are fielding questions from prospective voters, including some who are undecided, the networks have said.

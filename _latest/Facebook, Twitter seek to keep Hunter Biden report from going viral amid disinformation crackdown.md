Following heavy criticism over the way they let misinformation run wild on their platforms in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, social media companies gradually have been adopting stronger policies to stem the spread of misinformation.

For the first time, Facebook and Twitter deployed those policies Wednesday against a major news outlet to prevent a sensational political story from going viral.

Hours after the New York Post published a story about Hunter Biden’s involvement with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma, Facebook said it would reduce the article’s distribution on its platform until it was verified by a third-party fact-checker.

Twitter followed suit shortly after and blocked users from sharing the story. The company said its decision stemmed from its policy on “hacked materials.”

Alex Stamos, who served as Facebook’s chief security officer and is now director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, said in a tweet that he could not recall Facebook and Twitter ever taking similar actions against a mainstream news organization.

The unprecedented moves come just three weeks before the presidential election, with Democratic candidate Joe Biden, Hunter’s father, leading polls by a wide margin. Trying to portray the younger Biden’s role on Burisma’s board as corrupt has been a key political strategy for President Trump, and his insistence that Ukraine launch an investigation into the matter led to his impeachment last year. U.S. intelligence officials have said that allegations involving Ukrainian corruption are part of Moscow’s efforts to boost Trump’s reelection campaign, but that hasn’t persuaded the president or his allies to drop the issue.

Twitter said it considered the haziness around the origins of the materials — which the Post said originated with a laptop someone who may or may not have been Biden dropped off for repair and never collected — in deciding to take action to limit the spread of information. The company did not provide additional information and declined to comment on whether it had concluded the content of the article was the result of a hack.

In the last two weeks, Facebook has implemented a comprehensive ban on QAnon-related pages, groups and Instagram accounts, reversed its longstanding policy of allowing posts that deny the Holocaust and restricted ads that discourage people from getting vaccines. On Wednesday, Twitter, too, said it will remove posts denying the Holocaust.

A Facebook spokesman said on Twitter that the extra caution on the New York Post story stems from the company’s “standard process” of preventing the spread of misinformation.

Asked about Facebook’s decision, spokesman Andy Stone referred a reporter to a 2019 blog post, “Helping to protect the 2020 U.S. elections.” That post states, “In many countries, including in the US, if we have signals that a piece of content is false, we temporarily reduce its distribution pending review by a third-party fact-checker.”

Stone did not elaborate on what signals Facebook used to determine the Post story required further fact checking.

The public health consequences of COVID-19 misinformation and the threats to democracy posed by U.S. election misinformation have highlighted the potential harm that can occur when platforms don’t effectively moderate content, said Kat Lo, a researcher who studies online content moderation at the nonprofit Meedan.

In the past, Facebook may have thought that limiting the reach of a story still in dispute was an overreach of speech-policing policies, Lo said.

Now, she said, the company may have learned from its slow action on moderating QAnon-related content. QAnon is a conspiracy theory that baselessly claims that a Satan-worshipping cabal of Democrats and other elites operates a shadowy child sex-trafficking ring.

WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer an "apologist for the Republican position" during a tense interview about the current state of a COVID-19 stimulus package.

Democrats and the Trump administration remain at an impasse over the total amount to spend on a new stimulus deal.

Progress around a new plan has been inconsistent and rocky: President Donald Trump briefly pulled out of negotiations last week, telling Senate Republicans he wanted them to focus on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination hearing instead.

Since then, the president reversed course, first calling for stand-alone bills on airline relief and $1,200 stimulus checks, and then offering a $1.8 trillion proposal that Democrats rejected as inadequate.

“As you know, there are Americans who are being evicted from their homes. They can’t pay their rent. Many Americans are waiting in food lines for the first time in their lives,” Blitzer noted at the beginning of the interview with Pelosi. “Can you look them in the eye, Madam Speaker, and explain why you don’t want to accept the president’s latest stimulus offer?”

Pelosi then pondered if Blitzer would “ask the same question of the Republicans” before insisting the GOP bill doesn’t meet the needs of Americans.

Blitzer asked Pelosi why she would not take the $1.8 trillion deal, referencing statements from Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who say she should.

"I don’t know why you’re always an apologist and many of your colleagues are apologists for the Republican position," Pelosi said.

"Ro Khanna -- that’s nice. That isn’t what we’re going to do, and nobody's waiting 'til February. I want this very much now because people need help now. But it's no use giving them a false thing just because the president wants to put a check with his name on it in the mail," Pelosi continued during the nearly 14 minute interview.

The loans for businesses have now expired, a federal boost to unemployment benefits ran out, and airlines warned of mass layoffs and furloughs after their federal assistance lapsed at the beginning of the month.

Blitzer pressed Pelosi about not calling Trump directly to work out a deal, and about a letter she sent to House Democrats on Tuesday morning where she reiterated her opposition to the White House proposal, saying in some respects, the White House proposal "makes matters worse."

"A fly on the wall or wherever else it might land in the Oval Office tells me that the President only wants his name on a check to go out before Election Day and for the market to go up," Pelosi wrote.

Blitzer questioned if there is reluctance to make a deal to "not allow the president to take credit if there's a deal."

"With all due respect, with all due respect — and you know we’ve known each other a long time, you really don't know what you're talking about," Pelosi told Blitzer. "Do a service to the issue and have some level of respect for the people who have worked on these issues, written the bill to begin with."

The interview concluded tensely.

Blitzer attempted to end the interview, saying, "These are incredibly difficult times right now and we'll leave it on that note —"

Pelosi responded, "We'll leave it on the note that you are not right on this, Wolf, and I hate to say that to you. But, I feel confident about it, I feel confident about my colleagues, and I feel confidence in my chairs."

"It's not about me, it's about millions of Americans who can't put food on the table, who can't pay the rent," Blitzer replied.

Pelosi interjected, saying repeatedly: "And we represent them.... We know them."

"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good," Blitzer continued, leading Pelosi to argue that "was always the case, but we're not even close to the good."

"Thank you to your sensitivity to our constituents needs," Pelosi responded. Blitzer replied he is sensitive to them because he sees them "on the street begging for food, begging for money."

"Have you fed them? We feed them. We feed them." Pelosi replied before Blitzer went to commercial.

The president has repeatedly shifted positions on an aid package, tweeting Tuesday: "STIMULUS! Go big or go home!!!"

The two sides remain at a standstill over the total amount to spend, the level of funding for state and local government assistance, a national COVID-19 testing plan, and election assistance funding, among other provisions.

Between the losses of Nick Chubb and Austin Ekeler and the potential cancellation of the Titans/Bills game, the running back position is turning into a real disaster.

We have already lost Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey and Raheem Mostert, and high-profile players such as Derrick Henry, Miles Sanders and Josh Jacobs have failed to live up to the hype. Fantasy football owners are hitting the trade phones hard, but to no avail. Is it because trading in fantasy football is dead, or is it because those in need are setting their sights too high?

When it comes to trading, the biggest obstacle in getting a deal done is you. You might think you’re making fair and reasonable offers, and maybe you are. But the problem is your targets. No one is trading you Dalvin Cook or Ezekiel Elliott in the wake of these injuries, and if they do, they want a king’s ransom in return.

It’s counterproductive to blow up your whole team in an effort to replace elite talent, because you’re just robbing Peter to pay Paul. You need to think smaller. Trades that offer a simple tweak to your lineup are vastly underrated. Instead of trading for someone’s elite running back, search the fringe players and pay less.

Antonio Gibson is highly underrated because he plays for Washington, but his consistency is exactly what you need. In PPR formats, he has posted double-digit fantasy points and scored a touchdown in three-straight games. Chase Edmonds is on the verge of stealing the starting job from Kenyan Drake in Arizona. Joshua Kelley has carved out a role for himself with the Chargers, and D’Ernest Johnson is about to get a piece of that coveted Cleveland backfield.

Retain your top players and deal your receiver or quarterback depth. You could get the job done pairing one of them up with a solid tight end even. There is no need to go for broke. A small tweak can tide you over.

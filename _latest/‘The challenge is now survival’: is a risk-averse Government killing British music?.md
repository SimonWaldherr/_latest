The music business has been badly hit by Covid-19 restrictions. And following recent government interventions, things may be taking a turn for the worse.

“The challenge the industry is facing now is essentially survival,” according to Ian Huffam, a director of X-Ray Touring, whose clients include Coldplay and Robbie Williams. “It’s not just the survival of artists, venues and promoters, it’s the whole live ecosystem. The prospects for next year are grim.

“I’ve written off the first six months, and remain unconvinced that summer festivals have more than a 50-50 chance of going ahead. Live music is entering a deeply concerning phase. It’s a rocky road, and there will be casualties.”

The mood within the business seems to be turning extremely dark. “Fatigue is setting in. It’s gone on much longer and deeper than we probably imagined,” says Mark Davyd, head of lobbying body Music Venues Trust. “If everybody wasn’t exhausted enough already, we are certainly exhausted by the process of constantly changing messages from the Government.”

Anger and confusion greeted Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s comments about “non-viable” businesses being ineligible for his job support scheme. “The V-word – viable – knocks out a whole load of music people,” says Kwame Kwaten, head of Ferocious Talent and vice-chair of the Music Manager’s Forum.

“Live music brought in £4.5 billion in 2019, and supports 210,000 jobs, nearly a quarter of a million skilled people. The ripple effect for us is tour managers, roadies, engineers, lighting techs, transportation, front of house, keyboard techs, drum techs, stagehands, live agents, promoters, ticketing companies, merchandise, security, catering all becoming ‘unviable’.

“There’s the hole, right there. Because unless your business is earning right now, you can’t say, ‘I’m going to cover this amount of wages and the government can cover the rest.’ You cannot say that an industry that brings £4.5 billion a year to the UK is suddenly not viable. We are b----y viable!”

US officials are hoping to reopen travel between New York City and London by Christmas, with shortened quarantine periods.

With a growing availability of Covid-19 tests, officials at the US Transportation Department, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies are hoping to revive travel corridors with key international destinations, the Wall Street Journal reports.

A Homeland Security official said the agency’s work to “safely encourage trans-Atlantic travel while mitigating public-health risks” was in its early stages. The US is reportedly in talks with Germany about a possible travel corridor, as well.

Last week, the Telegraph reported that passengers using two of the world’s biggest airlines – United Airlines and Cathay Pacific – travelling through London Heathrow will be the first to test a new ‘All Clear Covid Passports’.

The volunteer passengers will upload their coronavirus test results from a validated laboratory onto a digital health pass up to 72 hours before departure. If the trials of the scheme are successful, it will allow passengers to reduce their time in quarantine in line with the self-isolation regulations and health requirements in whichever country they arrive.

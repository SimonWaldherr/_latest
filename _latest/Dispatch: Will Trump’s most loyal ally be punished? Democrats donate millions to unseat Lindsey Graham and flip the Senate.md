  Dispatch: Will Trump’s most loyal ally be punished? Democrats donate millions to unseat Lindsey Graham and flip the Senate

<div><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s great about America is that someone who grew up 10 miles behind the starting line can still win,&#8221; said the father-of-two, wiggling his hips to James Brown&#8217;s Get On Up in the&#160;sticky October heat.</p>
<p>His popularity has earned him comparisons to Democrat posterboy Beto O'Rourke, the charismatic former congressman who threatened to unseat Ted Cruz in Texas in the 2018 midterms.</p>
<p>Mr Graham, meanwhile, has positioned himself as the tried-and-tested candidate, an old-school Southern conservative who can best represent the state&#8217;s values.&#160;</p>
<p>But he has hitched his wagon to Mr Trump, who is in many ways his antithesis. Mr Graham, who serves as Chair of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has defended the president at every turn and was one of his most aggressive defenders during impeachment hearings last year, earning him the nickname &#8220;Lindsey the Lackey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decorated former Air Force pilot was not always a fan of the New York real estate developer, however, calling him a &#8220;race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot&#8221; and a &#8220;kook&#8221; who was unfit to be president before he won the Republican nomination.</p>
<p>Mr Harrison has used his rival's about-turn to his advantage, joking during an appearance on the popular late-night Jimmy Kimmel Show that "there are more flip flops with Lindsey Graham than there are on Myrtle Beach right now.&#8221; His campaign has even begun selling $25 pairs of flip-flops&#160;printed with&#160;the senator&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>It has not gone down too well with moderates in the south, some of whom see Mr Trump as a bombast and a liability who is pulling the GOP away from its founding principles.&#160;</p>
<p>Some 49 per cent of voters surveyed in a recent Siena College poll said they do not think Mr Graham is honest and trustworthy, compared to 41 per cent who said they thought he is.</p>
<p>Benjamin Edwards, a one-time Republican who used to go door-to-door canvassing for Mr Graham, now counts himself among the 49 per cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of people who can&#8217;t stand what Graham has become, they feel a sense of betrayal,&#8221; the law professor told The Telegraph. &#8220;He was once a man of integrity, but his silence with each Trump outrage has been deafening,&#8221; said Mr Edwards, who has donated to Mr Harrison&#8217;s campaign this time around.</p>
<p>But some among the party&#8217;s disgruntled have rallied behind Mr Graham as he shepherds Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the president&#8217;s new Supreme Court pick, through the confirmation process.</p>

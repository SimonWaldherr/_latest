<p>The proposal was <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-bob-woodward-microsoft-bill-gates-37-billion-deal-2020-10-1029667401#?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank">named after Buffett</a> because the investor <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-higher-taxes-class-warfare-extraordinary-kurt-andersen-2020-10-1029656423?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank">famously observed</a> that he pays a higher tax rate than his secretary.</p><p>"Warren Buffett, who many people in America have come to know as an extremely successful, generous, and gregarious man, shined a very, very bright light on this subject," Biden <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/12/remarks-vice-president-joe-biden-tax-fairness-campaign-event" target="_blank">said at a campaign event</a> in New Hampshire in April 2012.</p><p>"He noted the absurd fact that he as a billionaire, under the current tax laws, pays a lower tax rate than his secretary pays," the politician continued.</p><p><strong>Read More:&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-small-companies-recommendations-high-upside-rbc-2020-10?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buy these 7 unheralded stocks right now for near-term upside of at least 25% as growth accelerates to a new level, RBC says</a></p><p>Biden called for a change to that situation in a tweet at the time. &#13;

<p>"I'm for the Buffett Rule because it just makes sense," he said. "Like the President says&#8212;it's not class warfare. It's math."</p><p>Biden plans to pursue a similar policy if he becomes president. Part of his plan to expand access to affordable healthcare is to eliminate capital-gains tax loopholes and roll back President Trump's tax cut on the super wealthy, which would double the capital-gains tax rate to nearly 40% for those making over $1 million a year.</p><p>"Warren Buffett said it best when he stated that he should not pay a lower tax rate than his secretary," <a href="https://joebiden.com/healthcare/#" target="_blank">Biden's campaign website reads</a>.</p><h2>3) Corporations are too focused on the short term</h2><p>Biden and Buffett have both flagged the problem of companies prioritizing short-term gains over long-term progress.</p><p>Economic growth and wage gains suffer when corporations pump up their stock prices instead of investing for the long run, Biden argued in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-short-termism-saps-the-economy-1475018087" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal op-ed in September 2016</a>. &#13;

<p>Linking executive compensation to stock prices, unlimited buybacks, tax laws that treat investments as long term after one year, activist investors pushing for near-term gains, and a "financial culture focused on quarterly earnings and short-run metrics" all contribute to the issue, he said.</p><p>Buffett and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called for public companies to consider ditching quarterly earnings guidance in their own <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-termism-is-harming-the-economy-1528336801?emailToken=7cfbd7d1034a87693b3b3d2b3ae41bf3KAhJzw3s88ciwQxj82kNl/GWEzmmvMNQPrNjYc/CX6rNP5vtShhZ2oQC4YXFm9O0azse5mOiv1Ixlbcuno4RTQ%3D%3D&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_sharehare" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal op-ed in June 2018</a>. The two executives argued it encourages companies to sacrifice long-term progress and sustainability for short-term profits.</p><p>"Jamie Dimon &amp; Warren Buffett's call to end quarterly guidance is an important step toward ending our nation's culture of short-termism," Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1005469583904530432" target="_blank">tweeted in response</a>.</p><p>"America's workers &amp; investors will all be better off with a system that rewards those who build for the long-term," he added.</p><h2>A quiet alliance?</h2><p>Biden shares Buffett's positive view of America, his desire to raise taxes on the ultra wealthy, and his belief that a short-term focus hurts companies in the long run. &#13;

<p>Buffett hasn't publicly endorsed Biden for president, but given their agreement on several subjects, it's easy to imagine the pair working together if the Democrat is elected.</p><a></a><p>Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-joe-biden-share-views-america-taxes-earnings-guidance-2020-10" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> </p></div>

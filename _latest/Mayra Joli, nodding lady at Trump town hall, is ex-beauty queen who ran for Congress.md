The mystery “nodding woman” who went viral during President Trump’s town hall Thursday night has been revealed as a pro-Trump immigration attorney and former beauty queen who once ran for Congress.

Mayra Joli was identified as the woman who nodded enthusiastically and even flashed a thumbs-up sign behind the president as he fielded questions from undecided voters in Miami, according to the Miami Herald.

The fervent Trump supporter even greeted the president after the town hall, posting video of the encounter to her Facebook.

“We have your back! You are the best! I’m from the Dominican Republic, but I’m American. I’m an American,” she tells Trump.

“Sammy Sosa? A friend of mine,” Trump replies.

“Sammy Sosa — he endorsed me. Mr. President, I was running for Congress and he endorsed me!” Joli shouts back.

The former five-time beauty queen garnered 2.5 percent of the vote in her 2018 run as an independent for Florida’s 27th Congressional District — losing to Democrat Donna Shalala, the Herald reported.

She credited Trump for serving as her inspiration.

“I am not looking to run because I need a paycheck, like Donald Trump,” she told the Herald. “I’m not looking to run because I need fame, like Donald Trump. I’m running because I need this country to succeed. Like Donald Trump, I don’t drink.”

Joli is from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republican and resides in Coral Gables, according to her Facebook page. She is a partner at the Joli Law Firm located in Miami.

She also appears as a pundit on Spanish-language television, according to the Herald.

Joli did not ask a question at the town hall, which was held before an audience of undecided voters.

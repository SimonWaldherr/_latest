  Isolation kills, especially seniors. Community spaces can be a vaccine for COVID loneliness. 
description: > 
  Recent analysis of federal data suggests that isolation has contributed to 13,200 excess dementia deaths since the pandemic’s start.Many avoid isolation by socializing in religious spaces, senior centers and “third places” such as coffee shops, parks and libraries.Preventable deaths and suffering from isolation will rise if we don’t safeguard the public spaces that inoculate elders against the toll of loneliness.Such measures risk reversing strides made in protecting essential public spaces and promise an interminable cycle of reopening and closing.Public life is a treasure that deserves our protection.

<div><p class="gnt_ar_by">Stacy Torres</p><p class="gnt_ar_pb">Opinion columnist</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Throughout the pandemic, I&#8217;ve had serendipitous interactions in public with folks I&#8217;d never meet in my work and online spaces. Many are older adults I encounter on public transportation, at parks, outdoor cafes, and doctor&#8217;s waiting rooms. When the sky turned tangerine from wildfire smoke, I commiserated with a lifelong San Francisco resident in his 70s as we waited for an ophthalmology appointment. He shook his head and said he'd never seen anything like the eerie golden&#160;fog over Golden Gate Park.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Recent&#160;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/16/coronavirus-dementia-alzheimers-deaths/?arc404=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">analysis&#160;of federal data</a> suggests that isolation has contributed to 13,200 excess dementia deaths since the pandemic&#8217;s start. To prevent COVID outbreaks, nursing homes have curtailed family visits and social activities, such as group classes and shared meals, that help stimulate the mind and blunt dementia&#8217;s ravages.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">These findings tell us something important about the dangers of losing in-person connections for the majority of seniors who live in the community.

Most lived alone, far from relatives, or they&#160;had outlived family and friends, and these connections helped them remain independent. After hip surgery, one 88-year-old man received 20 visitors from the bakery&#160;who brought him food, newspapers, and their well wishes.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Family visiting their mother in nursing home on Oct. 12, 2020, in Minneapolis."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">I&#8217;ve become acquainted with another elderly&#160;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/985692.985721?download=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">familiar stranger</a><strong>&#160;</strong>at a North Beach cafe. She lives a 10-minute bus ride away. I still don&#8217;t know her name but have learned about her upbringing in the Philippines and her daughter&#8217;s recent move out of the city. One afternoon as we sat at opposite ends of a bench in Washington Park, a man in his mid-30s sat between us, dropped his mask, and made a phone call in view of a sign about distancing and mask rules for park-goers. He ignored me as I asked him to wear his mask, before growling at me that if I was so afraid, I should stay home. He's the one who should stay home, my bench neighbor complained as he walked away.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">No one should have to stay home.

I think of a beloved, now-closed dive bar in San Francisco&#8217;s Tenderloin, where I chatted with a septuagenarian regular named Robert. He died in March. We&#8217;ve rightly worried about older adults&#8217; vulnerabilities, but the old can teach us much about surviving a plague. Robert showed me the value of humor in the face of adversity and spoke openly about his past struggles with drugs, military service, and his first wife&#8217;s suicide. We laughed together. I miss him, his honesty, and the camaraderie we found in this place lost to the pandemic.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Protect each other to avoid isolation&#160;</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In times of deep social and political division, these spaces also provide a venue for us to talk to people who don&#8217;t share our worldview.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-opinion-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On a road trip, I chatted with the owner of a diner on the Oregon-California border, in a county where&#160;<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2016/11/oregons_trumpiest_county_home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">79%&#160;of voters cast a ballot for Trump</a> in 2016.

Older adults and people with preexisting conditions will feel the pain most. Without aggressive action to ensure that we can age safely and comfortably in the community, we risk forever losing the neighborhood spaces that&#160;thread our increasingly frayed social fabric&#160;and&#160;transform a collection of buildings, sidewalks, and storefronts into home.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://stacymtorres.wordpress.com/?_ga=2.243138561.248871450.1600002765-1865521976.1594220948" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Stacy Torres</a>, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors,&#160;is an assistant professor of sociology in&#160;the&#160;Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at University&#160;of California, San Francisco.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/opinion/2020/06/01/june-cartoon-commentary-politics-trump-democrats-minneapolis-slaying/5310942002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

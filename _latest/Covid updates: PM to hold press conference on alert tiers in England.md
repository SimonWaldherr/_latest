At Whiston Hospital on Merseyside, in north-west England, there has been a sharp rise in Covid-19 patient admissions over the weekend.

The catchment area includes Knowsley, which has one of the highest infection rates in the UK.

There were 65 coronavirus patients on Friday. Today there are 90. Of those, nine are in intensive care - double the number a week ago.

Staff I spoke to seemed surprised and concerned about the rapid pace of events.

They were prepared for a second wave and there is scope to expand critical care capacity further.

But, while back in March they were told to postpone all non-urgent operations and appointments to free up beds, this time they are expected to continue with all forms of care as well as the Covid surge.

And the hospital management has warned there may come a point soon when all routine work will have to be put on hold once again.

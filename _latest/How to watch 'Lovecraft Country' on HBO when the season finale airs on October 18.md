The show is based on the 2016 novel written by Matt Ruff, and includes supernatural threats influenced by the works of horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. Misha Green serves as the series' executive producer, along with Jordan Peele and J. J. Abrams.&#160;</p><p>"Lovecraft Country" follows Atticus Freeman (Jonathan Majors), a Black man in the 1950s who sets off on a road trip across the country to find his missing father. He's joined by his friend Leticia (Jurnee Smollett) and his Uncle George (Courtney B. Vance). As they continue their search, the group encounters disturbing racist threats and monstrous creatures.&#160;</p><p>Though H.P. Lovecraft, who passed away in 1937, is considered a highly influential horror writer, he is also known for racist elements in his work and bigoted opinions in his personal life. These facts did not escape showrunner Misha Green when working on the series. While the show does take some inspiration from Lovecraft's mythology, Green makes a point to address the author's troubling history on race.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/lovecraft-country-hp-lovecraft-racist-racism-misha-green-series-premiere-hbo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wrap</a>, Green followed a similar strategy used by author Matt Ruff in the book that the show is based on. Speaking to reporters during a virtual press event Green said, "I think it was that thing that Matt was doing that I was really intrigued about, which is this idea of reclaiming it and not saying that we're going to honor all of your contributions to this genre &#8212; and there are many &#8212; but we're going to take that, we're going to acknowledge who you are as a person, as well, and we're going to move forward."&#160;&#160;</p><p>"Lovecraft Country" currently holds an "87% Fresh" rating on review aggregation website <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/lovecraft_country/s01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, as well as a score of 79/100 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/lovecraft-country/season-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.&#160;</p><p>Updated on 10/16/2020 by Steven Cohen: We've revised this article to remind viewers that the season one finale airs on October 18.</p><h2>How to watch 'Lovecraft Country'</h2><p>To watch "Lovecraft Country" you'll need access to the HBO cable channel or HBO Max streaming service.

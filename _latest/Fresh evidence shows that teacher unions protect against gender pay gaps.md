<p>Decreased union membership may have widened a gender pay gap between male and female teachers in Wisconsin, per a new <a href="http://papers.nber.org/tmp/92546-w27894.pdf">study</a> from the National Bureau of Economic Research.</p><p>The research follows Wisconsin because that state passed a law in 2011 that barred unions from bargaining on behalf of teachers and instead put the onus of negotiating for higher pay on teachers. The measure, called Act 10, also weakened union power by stopping union dues from automatically deducting from member paychecks. It ultimately led to an overall <a href="https://projects.jsonline.com/news/2016/11/27/for-unions-in-wisconsin-fast-and-hard-fall-since-act-10.html">decline in teacher union participation</a>.&#160;</p><p>Without union support, women teachers were less likely to negotiate pay raises than male teachers, NBER found. Younger female teachers earn 1.4% less than their male counterparts, and older ones earn 0.7% less than men. The researchers said that if the gap persisted over time, "women would lose an entire year's pay over the course of a 35-year career relative to men."</p><p>One <a href="https://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/economy/reports/2017/11/15/169146/attacks-public-sector-unions-harm-states-act-10-affected-education-wisconsin/">left-leaning think tank</a> found that across the board, median salaries for Wisconsin teachers fell by 2.6% and median benefits by 18.6%, five years after Wisconsin moved to decrease union strength.&#160;</p>

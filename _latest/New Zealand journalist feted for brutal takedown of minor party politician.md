<p>At one stage during the interview O&#8217;Brien held up her hand as Ross was talking about the mortality rate of Covid-19 compared to the flu, telling him she would not allow him to spread lies on her programme.</p>
<p>The exchange, which was posted to Twitter, quickly spread around the globe, attracting 7m views.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know exactly what you were doing; you were whipping up fear and hysteria among vulnerable communities,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien told Ross.</p>
<p>When Ross began responding with misinformation, O&#8217;Brien interjected: &#8220;No, no, no, I do not want to hear any of that rubbish&#8221;, before swiftly moving to her next question.</p>
<p>She finished the interview telling Ross he would not be invited back and with the sign off: &#8220;You&#8217;re dreaming, mate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her performance <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1317833439714942981?s=20" class="u-underline">earned her plaudits </a>from journalism academics and reporters in America and around the world.</p>
<p>CNN&#8217;s Jack Tapper said O&#8217;Brien &#8220;had some fans in the US&#8221; as a result of her skilful political interviewing, while journalist Glenn Greenwald called it a &#8220;masterclass&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;An absolute masterclass in interviewing a politician by New Zealand&#8217;s @TovaOBrien - one of the best interviews of a politician I&#8217;ve seen. Also one of the most entertaining,&#8221; Greenwald tweeted.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Brien is based in the press gallery at the parliament building &#8211; known as the Beehive &#8211; in Wellington, and previously worked as the station&#8217;s Europe correspondent.</p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic she has drawn the ire of some New Zealanders who witnessed her quick-fire questioning style during the prime minister&#8217;s daily stand-ups, which were live-streamed during lockdown.</p>
<p>She has received hate mail and frequent trolling for her work, but has refused to change her style.</p>
<p>After realising that her interview with Ross had gone global overnight, O&#8217;Brien tweeted: &#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</p>

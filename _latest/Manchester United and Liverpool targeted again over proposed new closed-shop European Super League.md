<div><p>Manchester United and Liverpool are among five Premier League clubs being targeted again in a renewed attempt by Real Madrid's president to launch a closed-shop European breakaway league.</p>
<p>Florentino P&#233;rez has seized upon the financial turmoil of Covid-19 and fall-out surrounding 'Project Big Picture' to apparently revive attempts to entice the elite to join him in walking away from the Champions League.</p>
<p>His plot, which is said to be supported by a new &#163;4.6 billion investment proposal from financiers, is among several radical ideas set to be floated between the big clubs in the coming months as discussions about the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/20/ruin-champions-league-introduce-even-games/">format of European club competitions beyond 2024 gather pace</a>.</p>
<p>Uefa were bullish about seeing off the rebel proposals on Tuesday night, pointing out this is the third time that P&#233;rez's plan has surfaced in just two years. Sources close to United and Liverpool also described reports of their involvement as "speculative".</p>
<p>Uefa said in a statement that it &#8220;made it clear on many occasions&#8221; that the governing body &#8220;strongly opposes a Super League&#8221;. &#8220;The principles of solidarity, of promotion, relegation and open leagues are non-negotiable,&#8221; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Uefa added that closed-shop proposals like those suggested by Perez &#8220;would inevitably become boring&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, leading figures in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/13/breakaway-bombshell-fa-reveals-big-six-threatened-quit-premier/">English game have expressed outrage</a>, pouring scorn on the proposals to attract major bank investment while other competitions face financial catastrophe.</p>
<p>Kevin Miles, the Football Supporters' Association chief executive, led a blistering attack, saying they "expose the myth that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/18/project-big-pictures-biggest-mistake-misunderstanding-history/">billionaire owners care about the English football pyramid</a>, or indeed anything other than their own greed".</p>
<p>"This has to be the last nail in the coffin of the idea that football can be relied upon to regulate itself: these billionaire owners are out of control," he added.</p>
<p>P&#233;rez's alternative plot was first detailed in the Football Leaks scandal almost two years and then last December, when Fifa denied being supportive of the idea after it emerged they had held talks.</p>
<p>It emerged on Tuesday in Spain that the campaign had been revived. Vozp&#243;puli reported at least 18 European teams would be involved in the new incarnation, which would become an NBA-style set-up, with no promotion or relegation.</p>

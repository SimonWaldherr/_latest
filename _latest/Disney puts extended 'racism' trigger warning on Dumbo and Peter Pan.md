description: > 
  Disney has introduced an extended trigger warning before Dumbo and Peter Pan, saying the cultural “stereotypes” which appear in the classic films were “wrong then and wrong now”.The animation giant first introduced trigger warnings in November last year, urging viewers that the films are “presented as originally created” and may contain “outdated cultural depictions".But on Friday Disney went that bit further, putting in place a longer warning as part of an ongoing review of its film library."These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now,” the warning reads.“Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.

<div><p>Disney has introduced an extended trigger warning before Dumbo and Peter Pan, saying the cultural &#8220;stereotypes&#8221; which appear in the classic films were &#8220;wrong then and wrong now&#8221;.</p>
<p>The content advisory notice, introduced on the new Disney+ streaming service, is played to viewers before the start of six classics - including Lady and the Tramp, Jungle Book, The Aristocats, and Swiss Family Robinson - and cautions viewers of the "harmful impact&#8221; of racist stereotypes.&#160;</p>
<p>The animation giant <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/14/disney-warns-racism-old-films-lady-tramp/">first introduced trigger warnings in November last year</a>, urging viewers that the films are &#8220;presented as originally created&#8221; and may contain &#8220;outdated cultural depictions".&#160;</p>
<p>But on Friday Disney went that bit further, putting in place a longer warning as part of an ongoing review of its film library.</p>
<p>"These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now,&#8221; the warning reads. &#8220;Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Disney is committed to creating stories with inspirational and aspirational themes that reflect the rich diversity of the human experience around the globe".</p>

Chris Christie is entering his second week in the hospital, making his battle against the coronavirus the most serious among those in President Trump’s inner circle, CNN reported Friday night.

The former New Jersey governor told the network that he has been treated with remdesivir, the same anti-viral treatment Trump took while hospitalized.

Sources who have spoken with Christie as recently as Wednesday night have told The Post and other outlets that he is doing well — but there have been scant updates on his health since then.

Unlike other senior Republicans who’ve had close contact with Trump — who are either convalescing at home or repeatedly taking tests to see if they’ve been infected — Christie has remained hospitalized longer than for the average COVID-19 patient.

Christie tweeted on Saturday — 7 days ago — that he had checked himself into a New Jersey hospital out of an abundance of caution after testing positive for the virus.

The median COVID-19 hospital stay in countries outside of China is five days, according to the medical journal BMC.

On Thursday his successor, Gov. Phil Murphy, told NJ.com that Christie is “the quintessential Jersey fighter.”

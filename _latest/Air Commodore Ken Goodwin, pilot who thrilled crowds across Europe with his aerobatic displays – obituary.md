Air Commodore Ken Goodwin, who has died aged 92, was a Cold War fighter pilot whose brilliant solo aerobatic displays attracted widespread acclaim.

When he joined 118 Squadron in July 1955, the squadron, based at Jever in northern Germany, had recently been re-equipped with the Hawker Hunter. His skill soon attracted the attention of his commanding officer, and he was encouraged to develop a six-minute individual display of aerobatics.

This consisted of a roll immediately after take-off and straight into a loop. After a series of turns and rolls he made a high-speed inverted fly-past and climb and, after a hesitation roll, he made an inverted approach before landing.

“All in all, it was fairly spectacular by the time I finished,” Goodwin commented: “At least I am told it was – naturally I’ve never seen it myself.”

His meticulous execution of the display resulted in his selection as the official aerobatic pilot for the whole of the Second Tactical Air Force in Germany. Over the next two years he performed at displays across Europe, where he was heralded as a brilliant pilot in the many newspaper articles describing his exploits.

After two years with 118 Squadron he was awarded the AFC in recognition of his achievements, and the widespread publicity for the RAF it had attracted across Europe.

The son of a First World War veteran who had served in the Coldstream Guards, Kenneth Joseph Goodwin was born at St Pancras, London, on May 2 1928. In August 1940 he and his two sisters were evacuated to the US, where they remained for five years in the foster care of Robert and Kay Fisher at their home in Pittsford, New York.

Goodwin was determined to follow his elder brother, who had served throughout the war as a pilot. Initially there was no requirement for new pilots, so Goodwin enlisted as an airman in 1946 and trained as an airframe fitter. The seeds of the precision that would be the hallmark of his time as an aerobatic pilot were sown on the parade ground, where he excelled at drill. He was selected to join the Ceremonial Unit at RAF Halton, regarded as a “cream” posting, and he was on parade at the Lord Mayor’s Show, the Cenotaph Parade, and the British Legion Service of Remembrance at the Albert Hall.

Finally, in July 1949 he was commissioned and began his training as a pilot. After gaining his wings he joined 92 Squadron at RAF Linton-on-Ouse near York, which was equipped with the Meteor fighter. He was soon selected to be the squadron’s aerobatic pilot, and he later led the formation team. He was to develop his skill as a solo aerobatic pilot when he was posted to 118 Squadron.

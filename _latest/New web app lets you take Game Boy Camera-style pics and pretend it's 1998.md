<div><p>The internet just got a bit more wonderful.&#160;</p>
<p>On Saturday a coder, animator, and electronic musician by the name of <a href="https://maple.pet/" target="_blank">maple "mavica" syrup</a> published a <a href="https://maple.pet/webgbcam/" target="_blank">free web app</a> that lets anyone take <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/06/03/game-boy-camera-canon-telephoto-lens/">Game Boy Camera-style</a> photos with just their browser and a webcam. It's super fun.&#160;</p>
<p>Over Twitter direct message, mavica, who prefers it/it pronouns and a lowercase styling, explained that a <a href="https://killscreen.com/previously/articles/cristine-loves-interstellar-selfie-station-instagram-meets-gameboy-camera/" target="_blank">2014 app made by Christine Love</a> led it to create an updated version of the late nineties classic camera toy. mavica recalled how Love's app, "Interstellar Selfie Station," helped it at an important moment in its life.&#160;</p>
<p>"[She'd] made the app back in 2014 but after a few months it got pulled off app stores," wrote mavica. "i found the original app when i was just starting my transition and the low-res pictures helped a lot with my dysphoria, so it meant a lot to me and i've wanted to recreate it in some form ever since then."</p>

<p>The web app is super easy to use, and lets you adjust the brightness, contrast, and color pallet of your photos.&#160;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I never had a Gameboy, but I love the aesthetic of its camera. This is really cool, thanks for making it! <a href="https://t.co/iC3oAeruDY" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/iC3oAeruDY</a></p>

<p>"[The] app is entirely client-sided, there's no storage anywhere in your device or the server, it's all only a single page with some basic javascript," mavica explained.&#160;</p>
<p>"[My] favorite part that people have shared with me so far have been other trans people who also noted that the filter helps their dysphoria and i'm so glad to have spread the same feeling i had 6 years ago," wrote mavica. &#160;</p>
<p>In other words, mavica's web app is not just fun &#8212; it's providing real value to people (though, of course, fun by itself is also plenty valuable).&#160;</p>

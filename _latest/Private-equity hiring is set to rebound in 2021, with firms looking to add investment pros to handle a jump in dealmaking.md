A new study from EisnerAmper found nearly three out of every four private-equity managers expects dealmaking to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021 â€” with 40% surveyed believing that level will be reached by summer of next year.

Managers are hiring to meet this demand, with the same survey finding a majority of managers planning to add to their investment and operations staff over the next 12 months.

Recruiting senior-level talent without the ability to meet in-person will be a challenge for both sides, headhunters warn, but employees slowly returning to the office might speed up movement.

Deals will flow, and manpower will be needed.

This is what private-equity managers foresee in 2021, according to a new survey of 250 alternative investment managers by EisnerAmper. Nearly three out of every four private-equity managers expect dealmaking to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, and 40% surveyed say that level will be reached by summer of next year.

"The survey findings unveil a fairly optimistic outlook, even as uncertainty lingers amid the upcoming presidential election and rising COVID-19 cases in some cities," said Peter Cogan, managing partner of EisnerAmper's Financial Services Industry, in a release on the survey.

To meet this demand, PE executives are adding to their team. More than half of managers surveyed said they planned to add to their investment teams over the next 12 months, and an even higher proportion of managers said they were going to beef up operations staff.

"Plans to resume hiring in 2021 is a strong indication that the private-equity industry is recovering from the disruption that the pandemic caused in the first half of the year," Cogan said.

That anticipated uptick in buy-side hiring comes as other areas of financial services are starting to see job cuts, with Wall Street banks lifting pauses they put on headcount reductions at the height of the pandemic.

Interviews Business Insider has conducted with private-equity recruiters show that hiring is already starting to come back, though some said PE firms are entering a wait-and-see mode as the November election approaches.

Bill Matthews, a recruiter at Braddock Matthews who focuses on the middle market, said that hiring activity slowed to a crawl in the weeks following the March shutdowns. Figuring out a normal interview process proved to be a challenge, he said. Some private-equity firms preferred to meet finalist candidates in person, which, in many cases, wasn't possible.

"The lengths of the searches were stretched out as a result of that," said Matthews.

"There were a couple of searches that were put on hold because firms decided, particularly with more senior hires, that it was not the best time to integrate a hire when firms weren't planning to be in the office until the first of the new year," he said.

But Matthews said that he's starting to see activity pick back up, with a focus on demand for portfolio operations roles, specifically with regard to talent development, management and acquisition positions.

"When COVID hit that became more of a priority," said Matthews. "Firms have been adding people to portfolio operations roles for the first time. And firms that have had people in these roles are adding to them and beefing up their teams."

Jason Schulman, a recruiter at Long Ridge Partners, said that the most hiring activity he's seeing within private-equity shops are for mid-level positions.

Senior hires, he said, are difficult to land in this environment because they're less likely to move. And with junior hires, there's less certainty about whether they are a good fit without meeting in person. Plus, if they just graduated undergrad or grad school, their experience working on deals during COVID has likely been limited.

"I would say the bar has gotten higher for you to move, where you have never set foot in their office and you don't know who they are," said Schulman.

"There are a lot of conversations going on and it's easy to take a call from a recruiter or go to an interview. But if [a PE firm] is going to hire someone they have never met, they have to be super confident they are the right person."

But going into 2021, the hiring is expected to be given new life by a fresh wave of dealmaking.

While dealmaking has slowed during the pandemic, is certainly not extinct, with billions in dry powder at private-equity firms and a rush from investors of all stripes to launch special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Larry Fink, BlackRock's CEO, said in a recent CNBC interview that SPACs would put pressure on private-equity companies looking to do deals thanks to the speed SPACs operate with.

Already, one private equity giant has responded to this competition: Apollo is backing a $400 million SPAC focused on energy companies.

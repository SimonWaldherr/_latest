<div><p>For more than 200 days, the citizens of Buenos Aires have lived in lockdown.&#160;Yet despite enduring one of the world&#8217;s longest quarantines, Argentina&#160;on Monday became&#160;just the fifth to reach one million confirmed cases of Covid-19.</p>
<p>With the end still out of&#160;sight, residents of the coastal city are counting not just the financial cost of the pandemic but the deep psychological one too.</p>
<p>An initial 10-day general national quarantine was decreed by the Argentine government on March 20, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/argentina-perfect-evidence-that-lockdown-are-a-disaster/">but it was later extended to weeks, then months.</a>&#160;</p>
<p>While the restrictions were lifted for large parts of the country in June, for residents of Buenos Aires and its metropolitan region, home to approximately 40 per cent of the country's population, those 10 days became seven uninterrupted months of lockdown.&#160;</p>
<p>The economic consequences of such prolonged restrictions are severe and small business owners have been one of the groups hardest hit by the restrictions.</p>
<p>"When the quarantine came, I had to close my business completely. There came a time when I owed seven&#160;months of rent, six&#160;months of electricity, six&#160;months of gas, and union and accounting fees," says Daniel Aponte, whose bar in Lan&#250;s, a neighbourhood in Greater Buenos Aires, is now open but only for outdoor service on pavement tables.&#160;</p>
<p>"It's a desperate situation because we're very much in debt and we're going to have to work a lot and wait a long time to catch up, and since we don't know what's going to happen next, it's a terrible uncertainty, which has affected me disproportionately in terms of my state of mind,"&#160;says Mr Aponte.</p>

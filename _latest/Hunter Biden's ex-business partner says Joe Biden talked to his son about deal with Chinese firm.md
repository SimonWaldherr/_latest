I have extensive relevant records and communications and I intend to produce those items to both Committees in the immediate future.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am the grandson of a 37 year Army Intelligence officer, the son of a 20+ year career Naval Officer and the brother of a 28 year career Naval Flight Officer. I myself served our country for 4 years and left the Navy as LT Bobulinski. I held a high level security clearance and was an instructor and then CTO for Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. I take great pride in the time my family and I served this country. I am also not a political person. What few campaign contributions I have made in my life were to Democrats.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the media and big tech companies had done their jobs over the past several weeks I would be irrelevant in this story. Given my long standing service and devotion to this great country, I could no longer allow my family&#8217;s name to be associated or tied to Russian disinformation or implied lies and false narratives dominating the media right now.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After leaving the military I became an institutional investor investing extensively around the world and on every continent. I have traveled to over 50 countries. I believe, hands down, we live in the greatest country in the world.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What I am outlining is fact. I know it is fact because I lived it. I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family. I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden. The reference to &#8220;the Big Guy&#8221; in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden. The other &#8220;JB&#8221; referenced in that email is Jim Biden, Joe&#8217;s brother.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hunter Biden called his dad &#8216;the Big Guy&#8217; or &#8216;my Chairman,&#8217; and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing. I&#8217;ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I&#8217;ve seen firsthand that that&#8217;s not true, because it wasn&#8217;t just Hunter&#8217;s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I realized the Chinese were not really focused on a healthy financial ROI. They were looking at this as a political or influence investment. Once I realized that Hunter wanted to use the company as his personal piggy bank by just taking money out of it as soon as it came from the Chinese, I took steps to prevent that from happening.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Johnson Report connected some dots in a way that shocked me &#8212; it made me realize the Bidens had gone behind my back and gotten paid millions of dollars by the Chinese, even though they told me they hadn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t do that to their partners.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I would ask the Biden family to address the American people and outline the facts so I can go back to being irrelevant &#8212; and so I am not put in a position to have to answer those questions for them.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I don&#8217;t have a political ax to grind; I just saw behind the Biden curtain and I grew concerned with what I saw. The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">God Bless America!!!!&#160;</p><p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_2"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

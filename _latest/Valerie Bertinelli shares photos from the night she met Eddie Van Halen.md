Valerie Bertinelli fondly remembered her late ex-husband Eddie Van Halen with a series of throwback photos.

On Thursday, the “One Day at a Time” actress, 60, posted several snapshots to her Instagram Stories of her time with the legendary guitarist, including one of them hugging on the night they first met. She also shared a second picture from that evening — August 28, 1980 in Shreveport, Louisiana — of them smiling for the camera.

Another shows the couple hugging on Christmas in 1980 and another of them at the carousel in Central Park in 1993 with their son, Wolfgang, who is now 29.

Van Halen died earlier this week at age 65 after a long battle with cancer.

He and Bertinelli married in 1981 and parted ways in 2001. The two remained good friends and Van Halen even attended Bertinelli’s wedding to current husband Tom Vitale.

Upon hearing the news of Van Halen’s passing, she shared a sweet family photo, writing alongside it: “40 years ago my life changed forever when I met you. You gave me the one true light in my life, our son, Wolfgang.

“Through all your challenging treatments for lung cancer, you kept your gorgeous spirit and that impish grin.

“I’m so grateful Wolfie and I were able to hold you in your last moments. I will see you in our next life my love.”

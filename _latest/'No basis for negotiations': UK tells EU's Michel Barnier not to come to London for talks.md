A Number 10 spokesman said: "Lord Frost has spoken to Michel Barnier to update the EU on the Prime Minister's statement.

"Lord Frost said that, as the PM had made clear, the European Council's conclusions yesterday had left us without a basis to continue the trade talks without a fundamental change in the EU's approach to these negotiations.

"There was accordingly no basis for negotiations in London as of Monday.

"He and Michel Barnier agreed to talk again early next week."

The Prime Minister's official spokesman, in a briefing on Friday, said there was "no point" in Mr Barnier travelling to London unless the 27 member states were willing to alter their position or wanted to discuss sector by sector arrangements to prepare for no deal.

"The trade talks are over. The EU have effectively ended them by saying that they do not want to change their negotiating position," the spokesman said.

The Prime Minister warned the European Union there would have to be a “fundamental change of approach” to Brexit negotiations or Britain would trade on WTO terms with the bloc next year.

Mr Johnson claimed that the UK would “prosper mightily” after embracing a no deal exit on January 1, after the end of the transition period, but he failed to carry out his threat to walk out of trade talks this month.

He had set an October 15 deadline of Thursday’s EU summit for a deal “to be in sight”.

EU leaders angered the Prime Minister with a joint summit statement calling on the UK to move on fishing, the level playing field guarantees and enforcement of the deal.

He accused them of seeking to keep control of UK legislation and fishing waters, failing to negotiate “seriously” and rejecting the British request for a Canada-style deal.

“As far as I can see, they have abandoned the idea of a free trade deal - there doesn't seem to be any progress coming from Brussels,” Mr Johnson said.

"So what we are saying to them is, 'Come here, come to us if there is some fundamental change of approach'.”

Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, said, “These negotiations will continue. I personally believe it would be better for both sides if an agreement could be reached.”

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said, “The EU continues to work for a deal but not at any price. As planned our negotiation team will go to London next week to intensify these negotiations.”

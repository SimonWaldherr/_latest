The meeting was mentioned in an email of appreciation that Pozharskyi sent to Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015 &#8212; a year after Hunter took the position on the board of Burisma, and a year prior to Biden pushing to have Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin &#8211; who was investigating Burisma &#8211; removed from his post.

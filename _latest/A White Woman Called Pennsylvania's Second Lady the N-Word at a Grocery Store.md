A white woman accosted Gisele Barreto Fetterman, the wife of Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, in a grocery store last weekend and called her a racial slur.

Fetterman posted a video from the incident on Twitter Sunday. It shows the woman pulling down her mask and telling Fetterman, “You’re a [n-word]” as Fetterman slowly pulls away in the parking lot.

The incident happened at an Aldi grocery store in Pittsburgh, Fetterman told CNN, “I ran to the local grocery store and was met by and verbally assaulted by this woman who repeatedly told me I do not belong here,” Fetterman wrote. “The confrontation continued into the parking lot where I was able to finally capture it after the crying winded down.”

The woman knew who Fetterman was, the lieutenant governor’s wife told CNN. “She called me a thief, she said, ‘There’s that [n-word] that Fetterman married," she said. The woman has been identified by Pennsylvania State Police, who are investigating, Fetterman told the New York Times.

Fetterman was born in Brazil and came to the United States with her family as an undocumented immigrant. She became a U.S. citizen in 2009 and is a longtime social justice advocate; she co-founded the food justice non-profit 412 Food Rescue and founded The Free Store, a department store of sorts with free groceries, clothing, and other items for people who need them.

“I’m a former DREAMer, I came as a young immigrant and my family lived undocumented for over a decade,” she told CNN. “Those were really scary times. If I had a knock at the door that I wasn’t expecting, it would fear that my family would be sent back to a country we fled due to violent conditions.”

Fetterman’s husband, John, is a former Democratic mayor of the Pittsburgh suburb of Braddock, and was elected lieutenant governor in 2018. He’s considering a run for United States Senate in 2022.

Gov. Tom Wolf tweeted his support of Gisele Barreto Fetterman on Monday.

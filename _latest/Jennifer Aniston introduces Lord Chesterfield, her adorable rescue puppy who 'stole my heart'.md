Jennifer Aniston has an adorable new addition to her life. But be warned, this upcoming video has extremely high levels of pup cuteness.

Meet Lord Chesterfield, the puppy the "Friends" actress adopted from a Los Angeles rescue.

"Hi! I‚Äôd like to introduce to you the newest member of our üêæ family‚Ä¶.this is (a very tired) Lord Chesterfield," Aniston, 51, wrote on Instagram Sunday, next to a video of the sleeping pooch. "He stole my heart immediately."

Adding pure joy to the moment, Lord Chesterfield apparently was loving his snack so much, he fell asleep with it protruding from his puppy mouth.

"Chesterfield, have you fallen asleep with your bone in your mouth?" Aniston can be heard whispering while shooting the video. "I think you have."

The whole scene had "Stranger Things" star Millie Bobby Brown throwing out love emojis in the Instagram comments section.

When Aniston says "family," she means it. "The Morning Show" actress is also dog parent to Clyde, her Schnauzer mix, and Sophie, her white pitbull. Clyde has served as an enthusiastic work companion.

And Clyde has also served as reminder to vote on Nov. 3.

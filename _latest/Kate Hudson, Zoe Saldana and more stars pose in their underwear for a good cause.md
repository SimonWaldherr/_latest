In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, celebrities like Kate Hudson, Zoe Saldana and Dakota Fanning are stripping down to their skivvies to spread the message and raise research funds.

The social media campaign was masterminded by Kit Undergarments, the line launched by Hollywood stylists Jamie Mizrahi and Simone Harouche in 2019. Throughout the month of October, the brand will donate 5% of all sales to the Women’s Cancer Research Fund, along with an additional $1 each time someone posts a photo in their underwear using the hashtag #kitstokickcancer and tagging @kitundergarments.

Part of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, the Women’s Cancer Research Fund supports research, education and outreach for the development of more effective approaches to the early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of women’s cancers.

Kate Hudson was among the first to heed the call, sharing a snap of herself jumping for joy in a pink bra and matching briefs from the brand — and it wasn’t long before other stars joined, with Katy Perry, Mindy Kaling, Michelle Monaghan and more posting selfies in their undies. Below, see all the initiative’s famous participants — so far.

Kate Hudson

“Sending a HUGE hug to all the survivors, the fighters and the families who have had to sadly say goodbye to loved ones. We fight to see the end of breast cancer in our lifetime! Let’s do this,” the “Almost Famous” star wrote, clad in Kit Undergarments’ Classic Demi Bra ($68) and High-Waist Boy Brief ($38) in Rose. “Also, voting in underwear is fun! So don’t forget if you have a mail in ballot to get it in as soon as possible.”

Zoe Saldana

The “Avatar” actress wore the Triangle Pullover Bra ($48) and Bikini Brief ($28) in Rose, writing, “I wear pink in honor of all women I know and love who have battled breast cancer.”

Dakota Fanning

Clad in the Classic Demi Bra ($68) and High-Waist Boy Brief ($38) in Rose, the “Uptown Girls” star snapped this sweet mirror selfie.

Katy Perry

The “Daisies” singer posed in a pink tie-dye bodysuit from the brand, which has sadly sold out.

Mindy Kaling

The “Never Have I Ever” creator paired the same bodysuit with heart-shaped statement earrings while posing in her closet.

Behati Prinsloo

“So happy to support @kitundergarments for breast cancer awareness month,” the supermodel captioned this series of bathroom snaps while wearing her tie-dye bodysuit.

Michelle Monaghan

“Save the boobies!” the “True Detective” star exclaimed, posing on her bed in the Triangle Pullover Bra ($48) and High-Waist Boy Brief ($38) in Rose. “Early detection is key ladies! Let this be a reminder to schedule your much dreaded but life-saving mammo, stat!”

Nicola Peltz

“There is a lot going on in the world right now, but it is also Breast Cancer Awareness [Month],” the actress (and Brooklyn Beckham’s fiancée) reminded her followers, pairing the Molded Balconette Bra ($68) in Sweet Pea with cozy gray sweatpants.

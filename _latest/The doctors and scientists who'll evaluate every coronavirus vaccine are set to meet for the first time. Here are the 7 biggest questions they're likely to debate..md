<li>An influential group of independent vaccine experts is set to meet Thursday to discuss future coronavirus vaccines.&#160;</li>
<li>The group advises the US Food and Drug Administration and will ultimately be first to vet any coronavirus vaccines.</li>
<li>The FDA almost always follows the recommendations of advisory committees, but isn't required to do so.</li>
<li>The experts are expected to discuss a wide range of topics surrounding a potential COVID-19 vaccine, including the rigor of data needed to secure an emergency approval and what to do about growing public distrust in the process.</li>

<p>An influential panel of experts convened by the US Food and Drug Administration is set to meet on Thursday to discuss what it would take to approve the first coronavirus vaccine.</p><p>The group, called an advisory committee, won't deliberate over any specific vaccine candidate, because none of the experimental shots are far enough along in the research process.</p><p>Instead, the group intends to discuss the rigor of data needed for a vaccine to gain emergency authorization or full approval. The meeting is also intended to shore up public trust in the regulatory process, at a time when an increasing percentage of the public is expressing misgivings about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>A livestream of the virtual meeting, set to run from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, <a href="http://fda.yorkcast.com/webcast/Play/c26e83a0f77a412296949f4f43af4c981d">is available here</a>.</p><p>The meeting will help lay the groundwork for consideration of at least two coronavirus vaccines as soon as next month. Programs respectively led by Pfizer and Moderna, are aiming to potentially submit their vaccine candidates for emergency approval in the second half of November. Once they do so, the advisory committee would meet again to discuss the application.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-what-to-watch-leading-research-2020-3">Pfizer and Moderna are neck-and-neck in the race to deliver the first effective coronavirus vaccine. Here's everything we know about the timeline and when you might be able to get a shot.</a></p><p>The first four hours of Thursday's meeting will be filled with presentations from government scientists, followed by 90 minutes of public comment and then 135 minutes for the committee to discuss and make recommendations. In short, it's gearing up to be a long and wonky day for the group of 25 experts, who come with backgrounds in virology, infectious disease, vaccines, law, and statistics.</p><p>Here are the seven biggest issues surrounding a COVID-19 vaccine that the committee will likely discuss.&#160;</p>

In the shadow of the election, can the vaccine process rid itself of politics?&#160;</h2><p>The vast majority of Thursday will be spent deep in the weeds of science. But the biggest question to address will be more philosophical: can the committee convince the public this process won't be marred by politics?&#160;</p><p>It's a vital argument to win, as more and more Americans express doubts about the approval process and politicization of a vaccine. The FDA <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slaoui-supports-safety-data-for-coronavirus-vaccines-emergency-use-authorization-2020-10">took a meaningful step a few weeks ago</a> by requiring at least two months of safety data on a majority of trial participants, a requirement that shut the door on having a vaccine before Election Day.&#160;</p><p>Dr. Paul Offit, one of the experts on the committee, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-interpreting-phase-3-coronavirus-vaccine-results-2020-9">told Business Insider last month</a> that he'll feel '"no political pressure" when he evaluates vaccine data.</p><p>"None," he reiterated. "And nor will the other people sitting there."

</p><p>Making that point clearly and convincingly will bolster trust, particularly as November 3 is less than two weeks away.</p><h2>2. How can we build public confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine?</h2><p>Gaining the public's confidence will likely go hand-in-hand with distancing the regulatory process from politics.</p><p>But beyond politics, there have been longstanding misconceptions about the safety of vaccines.</p><p>For example, a recent survey <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/10/19/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-racial-disparities/">conducted by STAT and The Harris Poll</a> found 58% of the US public would get vaccinated as soon as a shot becomes available, down from 69% who said they would in August.</p>

<p>The work to educate the public on the value of vaccines goes well beyond a single committee. But this group will have a prominent platform Thursday to pitch the American public on why vaccines are valuable overall, and why the process for this shot should be trusted.</p><p>In a letter to the committee, the Association of Immunization Managers emphasized the need for "maximum transparency" from the FDA.&#160;</p><p>"We hope this committee can show the public critical information such as how many people were enrolled in each clinical trial; details on their age, gender, and racial make-up; and what is learned from trials regarding the risk and the benefit of the vaccine," the association's letter stated.</p><p>The committee will directly address the question of public confidence in an afternoon session, where leaders of the Reagan-Udall Foundation, a nonprofit that supports the FDA, will present research and suggestions.</p><h2>3. What about giving the vaccine to kids?</h2><p>

</p><p>So far, coronavirus vaccine trials have focused almost entirely on adults, meaning that the vaccines probably won't be available initially for children.</p><p>To fix that, Pfizer's study recently expanded to include people as young as 12 , and a Moderna spokesperson previously said the biotech plans to start a pediatric study before year's end, if OK'd by regulators.</p><p>But that still leaves open questions about the broader strategy for vaccinating kids. The committee's perspective could prove valuable in deciding how many children need to be tested in trials before allowing kids to get a shot, and what other data the committee may consider.</p><h2>4. How should risks and benefits of a vaccine be weighed for an emergency approval?</h2><p>Just because a vaccine&#160;could&#160;be issued an emergency approval doesn't necessarily mean it should. Over the last several months, one troubling scenario has cropped up in interviews with several vaccine experts: what if a vaccine that wins an early approval turns out to be ineffective at stopping the virus?</p>

<p>A "safe but weak COVID-19 vaccine might actually worsen the pandemic," Marcus Schabacker, CEO of the nonprofit patient safety organization ECRI, said in a public comment to the committee.</p><p>Schabacker warned that when a vaccine becomes available, people might stop wearing masks or social distancing. "Resulting infections may offset the vaccine's impact and end up increasing the mortality and morbidity burden," Schabacker said.</p><p>This could deal a fatal blow to the public's confidence not just in COVID-19 shots but in vaccines in general.</p><p>When the committee is evaluating the first vaccines, it probably won't have much data to go on. The estimates of a vaccine's efficacy, in particular, may be fairly imprecise, hinging on just a few dozen cases of COVID-19 in the clinical trials.</p><p>Will that be enough data for the committee to recommend emergency use authorization, leading to the vaccine being distributed to millions of Americans? Or would this group of experts want to see more evidence before making such a call?&#160;</p><h2>5. How limited should an emergency approval be?&#160;</h2><p>While a full approval could make a vaccine available to most Americans, an emergency use authorization could target a narrower group of people who face a greater risk from the virus.&#160;</p><p>The general framework for an EUA is that the potential benefits outweigh the risks. It's a vague definition, and one that the committee will likely try to refine.</p><p>Complicating matters, the National Academy of Sciences has finalized its own recommendations of who should be prioritized to get a COVID-19 shot, putting healthcare workers and the elderly near the front of the line.</p>

<p id="gpt-post-healthcare-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-5" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p>That leaves the committee open to considering questions like:&#160;</p><ul><li>What if initial data is limited in showing how well the shots works in older people?&#160;</li><li>What factors should be used to limit an emergency approval to specific populations? Age? Occupation? Existing health problems? Residing in a geographic area with high infection rates?&#160;</li><li>Under what circumstances should an emergency approval be revoked?</li></ul><h2>6. What about mass-producing the shot?&#160;</h2><p>Overall, the FDA looks at three areas before approving a drug or vaccine: safety, efficacy, and manufacturing.&#160;</p><p>While often neglected, manufacturing is of critical importance. And in the urgency of the ongoing outbreak, the FDA has cut a corner, said Geoffrey Porges, a longtime biotech analyst at SVB Leerink who used to work in the vaccines business for Merck.&#160;</p><p>Typically, the FDA will require drugmakers to submit details on manufacturing "down to the smallest detail" as part of an approval application, Porges said. This includes details on how facilities are cleaned and how the company knows every batch of vaccine produced is a consistent product.&#160;</p><p>Vaccine developers typically have to take doses from three different produced batches and prove they are consistent by giving them to people and measuring their immune responses. That research is then submitted as part of an approval application.</p><p>Porges said the FDA is now "allowing the manufacturers to submit their consistency lots and the validation of the consistency lots after they have submitted an EUA."</p><p>While Porges said he sees this shortcut as justified during a pandemic, it will be a wonky but important topic on the committee's agenda: How can they ensure that the hundreds of millions of doses being made with unprecedented speed do not have flaws?</p>

<p id="gpt-post-healthcare-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-6" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p>The committee will directly consider the topic in a 25-minute session led by Jerry Weir, a longtime FDA scientist who now directs the Division of Viral Products.&#160;</p><h2>7. If a vaccine shows it works early on, what happens to people who got a placebo?&#160;</h2><p>Let's take one more step into the hypothetical future: If a vaccine shows it works relatively quickly during the course of a clinical trial, what happens next?</p><p>Obviously, the advisory committee will play a central role in vetting the data and making a recommendation on emergency approval. But will the group of experts also express any preferences on what should happen to those studies?&#160;</p><p>The questions include whether the clinical trials should keep going to collect more data, and what should happen to people who were given a placebo injection, instead of a working vaccine.</p><p>One physician helping run Pfizer's clinical trial called this an "ethical conundrum" in a recent interview with Business Insider.&#160;</p><p><a href="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/f/robert-frenck">Dr. Robert Frenck</a>, a pediatric infectious-disease physician and director of Cincinnati Children's Hospital's Vaccine Research Center, said that continuing to run the trial is ideal from a scientific standpoint, so that researchers can collect more data.</p><p>But the question is whether its appropriate to not give volunteers a vaccine that's proven to work, he continued.</p><p>For its part, Pfizer has said it expects to keep the study running even if it produces early success.</p>

<p id="gpt-post-healthcare-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-7" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p>Stopping trials early could also make it difficult to tell which vaccine is best down the line. With <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-what-to-watch-leading-research-2020-3">more than 40 candidates already in human testing</a> and nearly 200 vaccines in development, there could be several viable vaccines within the next few months.</p><p>But getting that scientific answer could come with a human price, Frenck warned, if it means keeping people on placebo and withholding a vaccine that is seen as safe and effective.</p><p>"How do you ethically justify that someone got COVID and died that you potentially could have given them a vaccine and prevented them from getting sick?" Frenck added. "If the justification is it is going to improve my scientific knowledge, that's hard. That's where the conundrum comes in."</p><p>The biotech industry's trade group, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, raised this as an unresolved issue in its own letter to the committee.&#160;</p><p>"Additional discussion is needed to determine how placebo-controlled trials can be maintained after an EUA is granted," wrote Gregory Frank, senior director of infectious-diseases policy at BIO.</p>

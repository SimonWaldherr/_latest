  Aboriginal legend Devil's Pool in Cairns where man's body was found making him 19th victim 
description: > 
  Babinda Boulders, or more aptly referred to as Devil's Pool, is home to an Aboriginal legend which, according to some, is the reason people continue to die there.According to Aboriginal lore, Babinda Boulders is haunted by the spirit of Oolana, a young woman from ancient times who drowned in that very spot.The latest victim, Mr Hoffman, went swimming in the pool on Wednesday afternoon with a 32-year-old friend.When a strong current swept through, the friend was able to get out of the water, but Mr Hoffman never resurfaced.The last person to die at Babinda Boulders before Ms Tam was Tasmanian man James Bennett in 2008.

<div><p>Apple isn&#8217;t done unveiling new gadgets this fall.</p>
<p>Despite staging a keynote event for the iPad and Apple Watch in September and another one for the iPhone this week, the tech giant is reportedly gearing up for a third event next month to announce speedy new computers.</p>
<p>Noted Apple leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1316908204681498624" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jon Prosser reports</a> that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is planning the event for Nov. 17, where it will reveal its first Mac computers designed with its new Apple-designed main processors based on the chips it uses in its iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p>Apple in June <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/22/apple-cuts-ties-with-intel-during-wwdc-keynote-address/">confirmed its long-anticipated breakup with Intel</a>, ending a 15-year tie-up with the giant chipmaker in favor of using its own silicon.</p>
<p>Apple said that its new processors perform better than Intel&#8217;s chips, and will allow future computers to be both faster and more energy efficient.</p>
<p>The new chips will give software developers who make apps for the iPhone and iPad new access to its laptops and desktop for the first time. Apple software chief Craig Federighi said in June that for those offerings, &#8220;most apps will just work, with no changes from the developer&#8221; on the new Macs.</p>
<p>Intel will still have some presence in Apple computers, however, with CEO Tim Cook saying that there are still a few computers with Intel chips coming down the pike that he was &#8220;really excited&#8221; about, and said that Apple will continue to provide software updates for Macs with intel chips for &#8220;years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full transition to homemade silicon will take two years, Cook has said, but will begin next month.</p>

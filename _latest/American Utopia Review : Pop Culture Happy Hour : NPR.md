<p>David Byrne and Spike Lee. Two artists with very defined, very distinct, and yet very different, sensibilities &#8212; but when you put them together, it works. The theatrical concert film David Byrne's American Utopia, now streaming on HBO Max, is a career-spanning celebration of Byrne's music, both with Talking Heads and his solo work. Director Spike Lee shoots the stage of Broadway's Hudson Theater from a host of angles to capture the exuberant, rollicking &#8212; yet rigorously choreographed energy &#8212; of Byrne and his fellow barefoot, silver-gray-suited performers.</p>   <p>The audio was produced by Mike Katzif and edited by Jessica Reedy.</p>

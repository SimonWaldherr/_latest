<div><p>The recent appointment of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/allegra-stratton-boriss-answer-kellyanne-conway/">Allegra Stratton</a> as No 10&#8217;s new press secretary has once again shone the spotlight on the power couples at the heart of Westminster life. The former Guardian&#160;journalist is married to James Forsyth, the political editor of The Spectator, whose best man was none other than the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.</p>
<p>Little wonder then, that the couple, who have two children together, now feature in a top 10 of the most powerful partnerships in politics. Published by Mace, a new glossy magazine for politicos, the influential index lays bare the relationships that confirm the old adage that behind every successful person is... another successful person.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Westminster bubble is small and quite hermetic,&#8221; explains Marie Le Conte, author of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/best-british-politics-books-buy-christmas-2019/">Haven&#8217;t You Heard?: Gossip, Politics and Power</a>. &#8220;Whether you&#8217;re a journalist, adviser or politician, you will be working very long hours in a space that is the size of a small village. The line between professional and personal becomes a blurry one after drinks in Strangers.&#8221;</p>

Jared Goff can always count on his biggest fan on game days.

Last week, model Christen Harper supported the Rams quarterback from home in quite the sizzling game-day ensemble, posting a bikini selfie on Instagram while watching Los Angeles top the New York Giants, 17-9.

“I guess watching football from home isn’t thaaaat bad,” Harper captioned the shot.

Beyond social media, here’s what else you need to know about Harper:

She was first linked to Goff around the Rams’ 2019 Super Bowl run

A month before the Rams battled the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 53, reports surfaced that Goff, 25, and Harper, 26, were an item.

“Jared is hiding her from everyone except some friends,” a source told SportsGossip.com in January 2019.

Harper confirmed her relationship with Goff in February of that year, posting a photo of herself arriving at the Super Bowl in Atlanta.

She has a collection of acting credits

California native Harper is also an aspiring actress. Last year, she starred in the sci-fi drama “Auggie” in the titular role, portraying the AI companion to Richard Kind’s Felix. She also appeared in a 2006 episode of “Entourage.”

She’s appeared on HBO’s ‘Hard Knocks’

Like boyfriend Goff, Harper also graced the small screen in August as part of “Hard Knocks,” HBO’s docuseries chronicling NFL teams.

In one clip, Harper is seen at Goff’s Los Angeles home, where the fifth-year quarterback is practicing his golf swing at the “Goff Course.”

“I had this land down here that was unused. I was going to do a basketball court … but there’s obviously risk of injury with that, I just didn’t see myself going down there, play basketball [as] much, I was like, ‘What can I do that kind of ties in the whole house together,’ and I think it works,” Goff said.

She’s adjusted to cheering on the Rams from home

Unlike previous NFL seasons, Harper can’t cheer Goff on in-person this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, she’s made the best of the situation.

Last month, Harper celebrated the Rams’ Week 1 win at their new home, the $5 billion SoFi Stadium, which will remain fanless amid the global health crisis.

“First W in SoFi,” she captioned a post on her Instagram story at the time.

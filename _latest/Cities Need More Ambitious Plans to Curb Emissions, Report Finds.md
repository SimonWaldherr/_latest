  Cities Need More Ambitious Plans to Curb Emissions, Report Finds 
description: > 
  And more than 1,500 local governments have moved to develop climate action plans and global greenhouse gas reduction targets.Of all states, California has the greatest number of large cities with established climate action plans, with 11 cities adopting goals.The report suggests that limited resources in smaller cities may make it more challenging for them to create tangible plans for emissions reduction.While the 25 largest cities contained 16 climate action plans, for example, the smallest 25 saw only six action plans.About 40 million people – about 12% of the total U.S. population – live in the 45 larger cities with active and fully-formed climate action plans, according to the report.

<div><p>Since President Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, largely eliminating regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level, local leaders have found themselves at the helm of emissions mandates. </p><p>More than <a href="http://climatemayors.org/actions/paris-climate-agreement/">450 U.S. mayors</a> have pledged to continue honoring the Paris Agreement. And more than 1,500 local governments have moved to develop climate action plans and global greenhouse gas reduction targets.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Still, more needs to be done, according to a new <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/pledges-and-progress-steps-toward-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reductions-in-the-100-largest-cities-across-the-united-states">report </a>by the Brookings Institution that examines how the 100 largest cities in the U.S. are addressing emissions reductions. </p><p>"Overall, the leadership of about half of America's larger cities stands as an important counter to federal drift," according to the report from the Washington, D.C.-based think tank. "With that said, more ambitious and rigorous efforts are needed in order to make the nation's 'bottom-up' climate commitments more effective."</p><p>The report assesses the greenhouse gas reduction pledges and commitments of the country's largest cities, tracks the emissions savings that could result from them, and evaluates whether cities are meeting their goals. The results are mixed, according to the authors. While some cities are on the path to meeting their emission goals on schedule, others have no formal pledges or climate action plan in the works whatsoever.</p><p>Of the largest 100 cities, 45 have fully established greenhouse gas reduction targets, which are projected to save over 365 million metric tons of carbon by 2050 total (the equivalent of removing 79 million passenger vehicles from the road), according to the report. Of those cities with established reduction targets, though, two-thirds are behind on their goals. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Of all states, California has the greatest number of large cities with established climate action plans, with 11 cities adopting goals. </p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4f85b10/2147483647/resize/640x/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F2e%2F50%2F11deea974e129c23e5989b556fbf%2F201021-citiesemissions-graphic.PNG" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 bPZJjX Image-sc-412cjc-2 ImageCaptioned__FWImage-sc-1yr50o7-0 csrByH"><p size="3" class="Paragraph-sc-1iyax29-0 Caption__Wrapper-bee4ah-0 ehAcng">Courtesy of Brookings Institution</p><p>The report assessed percentage change in emissions by looking at a city's emissions during its "baseline" year and comparing it to the most recent emissions measurements &#8211; dates which varied by city. Los Angeles saw the greatest percentage decrease in emissions, at 47% from 1990 baselines as of 2013. Greensboro, North Carolina, and San Francisco saw the second and third greatest percentage decreases in emissions, respectively. </p><p>On the other side of the spectrum, some cities are struggling to reduce emissions or are witnessing a rapid increase in the pollutants. </p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Tucson, Arizona, experienced the largest percentage increase in emissions at 39% above its 1990 baseline levels as of 2014, following the city's "runaway, sprawling growth." Fast-growing Madison, Wisconsin, saw the second-highest percentage increases, followed by Pittsburgh. Many of the higher levels are due to increased transportation emissions, says David Victor, nonresident senior fellow at Brookings and an author of the study. </p><p>"The hardest thing that the cities are finding is transportation is really, really difficult to manage, because a lot of the tools are outside of their scope &#8211; the vehicles that are available," he says. "California cities are going to have an easier time because they're going to have a state that's leading on zero-emission vehicles."</p><p>The report suggests that limited resources in smaller cities may make it more challenging for them to create tangible plans for emissions reduction. While the 25 largest cities contained 16 climate action plans, for example, the smallest 25 saw only six action plans.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>About 40 million people &#8211; about 12% of the total U.S. population &#8211; live in the 45 larger cities with active and fully-formed climate action plans, according to the report. While those numbers aren't insignificant, even if those cities do meet their climate action plan goals, the potential reduction in emissions would only equal around 7% of the original commitment the U.S. made with the Paris Agreement by the year 2050, according to the report. </p><p>"For all of the great things that are going on in these cities, it's only a small fraction of national emissions, and so it's really important that those cities that are pioneers, if you like, be much more focused on getting their pioneering to spread, and not just be thrilled with themselves about their pioneering status," Victor says. <br></p></div>

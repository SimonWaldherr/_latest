  Anti-Trump Lincoln Project launches coalition of veterans to oppose president 
description: > 
  A prominent group of Republican strategists working to defeat President Trump in November’s general election is launching a new coalition of veterans similarly opposed to the president.The Lincoln Project – in announcing the Veteran and Military Community Coalition – said that “our key message is very simple to this community: Donald Trump has proven to be an unfit Commander-in-Chief in every aspect of that most solemn duty.Rick Wilson – a Lincoln Project co-founder and fierce Trump critic – told Fox News that “veterans of every rank and every branch of service have joined the Lincoln Project to ensure we elect new leadership to serve in the White House."The Lincoln Project, formed late last year by never-Trumpers, includes Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who worked for then-President George W. Bush, the late Sen. John McCain and former California Gov.The president and his campaign have repeatedly belittled and discounted the Lincoln Project.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Reading a statement on behalf of local leaders, Mr Rotheram said: 'Collectively, we have consistently requested the scientific evidence that supported the imposition of the suite of measures under Tier 3 and we pointed out the inconsistency of the approach following the announcement that Lancashire would not in fact have exactly the same package of restrictions as our city region.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Talks continued until late last night and the Government have agreed with the case I put forward on behalf of city region leaders and that they would now bring us in line with other Tier 3 areas.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'This would mean soft play areas would be closed but gyms could reopen.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The changes are expected to come into play from Friday morning, when Greater Manchester goes into Tier 3.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms&#160;Holden said her gym would reopen fully as a 24-hour fitness centre as soon as the changes come into force.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has been fined &#163;2,000 for breaching the rules, which she said she would pay out of her own money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She told MailOnline: 'We're over the moon.

WE DID IT!!! On my 30th birthday this Friday 23rd, WE OPEN.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'Today is day seven of Tier 3 restrictions in Liverpool and what would have been the ninth day fighting to rightfully have our gyms reopened.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Guys we've done it, we've actually done it.

(CNN) "Driving While Black" has a specific modern meaning. "Driving While Black: Space, Race and Mobility in America" turns out to be an extremely rich and detailed PBS documentary, exploring the long history of restrictions on Black movement, from slavery through the present. As part of that journey, the two-hour film addresses not only modern-day issues of policing but deeper ones about the American Dream denied.

There is, inevitably, a section devoted to the period covered by the controversial Oscar-winning movie "Green Book," including the fascinating background of New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green, who came up with the idea of a publication telling African-American motorists where they could safely stay and buy gas when traveling in the South. As the film makes clear, it's indicative of the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit that grew up around navigating the Jim Crow era.

The range encompassed by "Driving While Black," however, is much broader than that, beginning with the way slaves were carefully monitored, as well as the impact of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which allowed slave owners to seek the return of those who escaped to the North, a significant contributor to the tensions that led to the Civil War.

The advent of the automobile brought new possibilities, but also highlighted inequality at virtually every turn. While whites "discovered the joys of the open road," as journalist Alvin Hall says -- with advertising jingles like "See the USA in your Chevrolet" -- Blacks saw cars as the means to achieving a better life, while using what they drove as a symbol of their status, especially to folks back home when they visited.

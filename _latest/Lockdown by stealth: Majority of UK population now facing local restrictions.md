Across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland around 5.8m people face extra local rules imposed by their devolved governments, compared to 4.7m constrained by a national baseline of restrictions.

Before today's announcement from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who told MPs in Parliament that the new measures were essential to "keep people safe and to prevent greater economic damage in the future", around 17.1m in England people had been living in an area either on "high" or "very high" alert.

The alerts are as part of the Government's new 'local Covid alert levels' system announced this week for simplifying and standardising local lockdowns in England, which brings in three tiers of potential lockdown restrictions, the first consisting of just national rules and the other two bringing in local measures.

These measures had been concentrated in the north of England up until today, with Greater Manchester under "high" alert having already faced restrictions before the new system while the Liverpool City Region had been the first area placed in the "very high" alert category.

However the changes today, which come into force at one minute past midnight for new areas on Saturday morning, add over 11m people to the total facing additional local measures, mostly in the south of England.

The vast majority of those newly locked down are in London, where all 32 boroughs have been placed on "high" alert, meaning 9m people are now banned from meeting other households indoors, whether in private homes or pubs and restaurants.

New weekly Covid-19 cases in London had risen from 71 per 100,000 to 97 as of October 10, prompting Mayor Sadiq Khan to warn today that Londoners faced "a difficult winter ahead."

He added: "Just as we have always done through our city's great history I know we will get through this dark time by pulling together."

Also placed in "high" alert is the entire county of Essex, home to 1.4m, as well as the city of York, where over 40,000 people live.

In addition Elmbridge, Barrow, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield are all now under "high" alert.

Some had expected Mr Hancock to also announce the movement of Manchester into "very high" alert like nearby Liverpool, after weekly cases in the city rose from 328 per 100,000 to 378.

Talks are still reportedly underway between local leaders in Manchester as to whether the region should be placed in the Government's toughest lockdown tier, with sticking points including additional funding to help the area cope with the stricter rules.

<div><p>This does admittedly require a high degree of monetary financing from the central bank, and it is perfectly true that a small, newly independent country would struggle to finance itself at the ultra low rates we see across much of the rest of Europe today. But it does offer at least some hope that Scotland would not be obliged to go fully cold turkey fiscally the moment it leaves the UK.</p>
<p>The perhaps bigger monetary challenge is that of the currency. Sturgeon says she intends to keep using sterling, at least for as long as it takes to establish a credible central bank with the reserves needed to back a new currency.</p>
<p>This is again a very tough path to follow, for it means accepting England&#8217;s monetary policy without any say in it. There would also be no automatic right to the Bank of England&#8217;s lender of last resort facilities, both for Scotland&#8217;s banking system and its government debt. In monetary terms, Scotland would be entirely beholden to London&#8217;s better nature.</p>
 
<p>Unfortunately, you can run such arguments, and others like them, until you are blue in the face; few of them these days achieve much cut through. The polls can shift, of course, but there is a growing sense of inevitability about Scottish separation. Progressive devolvement of power, far from making things better as it was supposed to, has only made them worse.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy the argument that it doesn&#8217;t matter, that the union has run its course and must now give way to a different order. A lot of things begin to unravel once the union goes. What ongoing justification would there be for Britain&#8217;s continued position on the UN Security Council, or the voting power and influence it enjoys with other multilateral organisations such as the WTO and the IMF? Would the maintenance of a professional standing army, or independent nuclear deterrent, even be viable if it was just England alone?</p>
<p>The union is dying of neglect, and with it Britain&#8217;s place in the world. The tragedy is that we seem powerless to stop it.</p>

NORTH LAS VEGAS – World No. 1 Dustin Johnson withdrew Tuesday from the CJ Cup at Shadow Creek after testing positive for COVID-19.

According to a release from the PGA Tour, Johnson started experiencing symptoms and notified the PGA Tour. He had a COVID-19 test and the result forced him to withdraw.

“Obviously, I am very disappointed,” Johnson said according to the statement. “I was really looking forward to competing this week but will do everything I can to return as quickly as possible. I have already had a few calls with the Tour’s medical team and appreciate all the support and guidance that have given me.”

Johnson, who won three times last season and was the FedEx Cup champion, is in self-isolation. In his last five starts – two in majors – his worst finish was a tie for sixth. Alternate J.T. Poston replaced Johnson in the field.

Johnson arrived in Las Vegas last Friday night, according to his agent, David Winkle of Hambric Sports. He played golf at another course in Las Vegas and then tested negative for COVID-19 on Sunday morning. But Johnson began to ache that day and dealt with some congestion and a mild cough. On Monday, Johnson didn’t do anything. When he woke up Tuesday, he still had symptoms and went for another test. He tested positive at an off-site location in Las Vegas run by Sanford Health.

Since the PGA Tour returned in June after a 13-week break, only 10 players have tested positive for COVID-19 on-site while two others have tested positive at home.

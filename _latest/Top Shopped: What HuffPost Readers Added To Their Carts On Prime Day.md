But we&#8217;re not ones for set rules, so we&#8217;ve decided to put out a special edition <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prime-day-official-start-date-best-deals-to-watch_l_5f6e1ca7c5b61af20e751d7e" target="_blank">just for Prime Day</a>. </p><p>ICYMI: This year&#8217;s Prime Day, which happened on Oct. 13 and Oct. 14, was pushed back <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/amazon-prime-day-delayed.html#:~:text=The%20coronavirus%20pandemic%20has%20pushed,U.S.%2C%20the%20company%20announced%20Tuesday.&amp;text=%E2%80%9CThis%20year%20we'll%20be,our%20customers%20and%20selling%20partners.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">because of the pandemic</a>. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the discounts we&#8217;re used to seeing were any different. A few were even better than expected &#8212; like on the <a href="//%E2%80%94" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revlon One-Step</a>, which was (and still is!) half off. </p><p>Amazon&#8217;s bona fide &#8220;shopping holiday&#8221; had more than a million deals, <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/shopping/announcing-prime-day-2020" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to Amazon</a>. Our shopping editors at <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/finds" target="_blank">HuffPost Finds</a> spent weeks finding out when deals would go live (and doing a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prime-day-deals-huffpost-editor-recommendations-2020_l_5f7c86d1c5b61229a057c5a5" target="_blank">little shopping of their own</a>, of course!), so we wanted to see what our dear readers decided to add to their carts. </p><p>It turns out that HuffPost readers couldn&#8217;t get enough of the latest <a href="https://amzn.to/2Tl8qnX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple AirPods Pro</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/3o5Nv6f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">charging pad</a> to power up an iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time. </p><p>Our readers didn&#8217;t just shop from Amazon during Prime Day, either.

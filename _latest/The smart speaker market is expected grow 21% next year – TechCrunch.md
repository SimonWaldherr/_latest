<div><p id="speakable-summary">New <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-smart-speaker-market-2021-forecast?ctid=1730-72f6fbee60c3de97dc1f5a6a57b2404d">numbers from Canalys</a> point to a strong growth in smart speaker shipments in Mainland China this year. The market is on track to grow 2020, having gotten the COVID-19 pandemic mostly under control in recent months. The rest of the world &#8212; much of which continues to struggle with the virus &#8212; is only expected to see a 3% growth this year.</p>
<p>The global market will return to greater growth, per the firm, with numbers hitting 163 million units in 2021, marking a 21% growth overall. In spite of a slow down in purchasing non-essentials, a prolonged shutdown in many areas should lead more consumers to consider the possibility of introducing new devices into their homes &#8212; or replacing older and outdated units.</p>
<p>The last couple of months have been fairly busy for such products. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank">Amazon, </a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank">Google </a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank">Apple </a> have all announced refreshes or additions to their smart speaker line. Google recently refreshed its baseline Home devices with new hardware and a new name, as the Nest Audio. Various Echo devices were updated as well, and Apple has finally introduced the long-awaited &#8212; and significantly less expensive &#8212; HomePod mini.</p>

<p>&#8220;The US $99 price segment is pretty much a no-mans-land in China, yet adequate to appeal to Apple&#8217;s user-base,&#8221; analyst Cynthia Chen says in a release. &#8220;Apple should take this opportunity to drive the uptake of its music and other services consumed at home.&#8221;</p>

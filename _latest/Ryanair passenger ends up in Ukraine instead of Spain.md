  Ryanair passenger ends up in Ukraine instead of Spain 
description: > 
  A woman claims she ended up more than 2,500km away from her intended destination after boarding the wrong Ryanair flight.Inka Fileva, 30, says she was due to fly to Valencia in Spain, but was somehow able to board an aircraft bound for Kiev, Ukraine.Falling asleep shortly after take-off, Ms Fileva, who lives in London, didn’t realise she was heading to the wrong country until the plane touched down.Once she realised what had happened, Ms Fileva became “scared” and started crying.Eventually, she was rebooked on a flight back to London the following day, with an onwards ticket for Valencia also secured.

</p><p></p><p>The bartender didn&#8217;t notice she had walked to the wrong gate for her early morning flight from Stansted airport on 18 October &#8211; and, apparently, neither did any of the gate agents responsible for checking her ticket.

</p><p>The situation was exacerbated further by the fact that Ryanair does not have a ticket desk at Kiev airport, according to Ms Fileva, who said she had to rely on other airport employees to help her.
</p><p>Eventually, she was rebooked on a flight back to London the following day, with an onwards ticket for Valencia also secured.
</p><p>It remains unclear how ticket scans failed to identify the error.

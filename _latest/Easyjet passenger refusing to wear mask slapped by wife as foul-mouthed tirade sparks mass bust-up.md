getting called.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You go on holiday for two weeks and spend all that money, you just have to toe the line when you're there in the streets, just for that short time and make little sacrifices.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An easyJet spokesperson told MailOnline: 'easyJet can confirm that police attended flight EZY1907 from Manchester to Tenerife on 6th September due to a passenger behaving disruptively onboard and refusing to wear their face mask.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In line with new guidelines, all passengers are currently required to bring their own face mask for their flight which must be worn during boarding and onboard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'easyJet's cabin crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously, and do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The safety and wellbeing of customers and crew is our highest priority.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On its website, the airline says that face masks must be worn 'throughout the flight', in the airport and at the gate when boarding the plane.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It states: 'In order to help protect yourself and others on your journey, you will need to wear a suitable protective face mask for boarding at the gate and throughout your flight with us.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is mandatory on all easyJet flights and you will not be permitted to board if you arrive at the gate without one.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You will also be required to wear a mask to enter and travel through the airport terminal at your departure and arrival airport.'&#160;</p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">FACE MASK POLICY IN THE UK</h3><p class="mol-para-with-font">Face masks must be worn on public transport and in many indoor spaces, including shops, shopping centres, indoor transport hubs, museums, galleries, cinemas and public libraries.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is currently the law for passengers to wear face coverings in taxis and private hire vehicles, in hospitality venues, like restaurants and bars, other than when you are eating and drinking.&#160;Staff in retail and hospitality settings are also legally required to wear face coverings.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If necessary, the police and Transport for London (TfL) officers have enforcement powers including issuing fines of &#163;200 (halving to &#163;100 if paid within 14 days).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes after the World Health Organisation and numerous studies suggested they are beneficial.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As announced, the Government will bring forward changes to mean that for repeat offenders these fines would double at each offence up to a maximum value of &#163;6,400.&#160;&#160;</p><p

have a responsibility to ensure the virus is suppressed and police will play their part in supporting the public to navigate the measures in place for our safety.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our approach of engaging with people and explaining the regulations in place will remain. The vast majority of situations are resolved following those two stages, with little need for further encouragement or enforcement action to be taken,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Police will continue to work with their communities and only issue fines as a last resort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Chiefs will be stepping up patrols in high-risk areas and will proactively work with businesses, licensing authorities and local authorities to ensure the rules are being followed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If members of the public are concerned that the law is being broken or they are experiencing anti-social behaviour, they can report this to the police, who will consider the most appropriate response and will target the most problematic behaviour.'&#160;&#160;</p><p class="adHolder mpu" id="mpu_factbox_1"><p class="mol-ads-label-container"><p class="mol-ads-label">Advertisement</p></p>

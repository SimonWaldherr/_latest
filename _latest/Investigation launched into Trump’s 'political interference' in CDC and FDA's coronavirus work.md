  Investigation launched into Trump’s 'political interference' in CDC and FDA's coronavirus work 
description: > 
  Donald Trump’s “political interference” with the coronavirus work of the CDC and FDA will be investigated by a government watchdog.The GAO is often called the “congressional watchdog” and is a non-partisan government agency that provides auditing and investigation services for the United States Congress.“The CDC and FDA’s independence as scientific agencies is crucial to safeguarding the public health and saving lives,” the Democratic politicians wrote in their request.Last week more than 1,000 current and former staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hit out at Mr Trump’s handling of the coronavirus response.The letter expressed dismay at the White House’s handling of the pandemic and called for the CDC to play a bigger role in fighting Covid-19.

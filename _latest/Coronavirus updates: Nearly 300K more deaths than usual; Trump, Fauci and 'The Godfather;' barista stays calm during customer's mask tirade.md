Trump has repeatedly called for states to ease COVID-19 restrictions while Fauci has counseled&#160;caution. Trump, in a phone call to campaign staffers, blasted Fauci as a "disaster" who along with other public health "idiots ... have gotten it wrong," NBC News reported, citing a recording of the call.

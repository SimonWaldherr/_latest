There’s been a shift in recent weeks. I felt it as soon as August moved into September – fresh mornings, a chill in shade, a quietening of insects.

The garden has been shrinking back: the meadow, which is now mostly shorn, no longer buzzes with bees and flies, or fills my nostrils with the heady scent of nectar. The pond has less activity, although the dragonflies eventually arrived and, while I’ve not seen any egg-laying or mating, I’m hopeful my pond made a suitable habitat for them. Only the butterflies keep the thrill of summer alive; recent sunny days have seen red admirals, large and small whites, the odd speckled wood and – gloriously and unexpectedly – a small copper nectaring on my sedums and Verbena bonariensis.

Autumn is, typically, a time for hard work in the garden. It’s when we gardeners finally wrestle with the borders and move things around, chop things back and plant bulbs. As a wildlife gardener, this poses problems for me: I’m desperate to pull the borders apart and replant. I foolishly planted an echinacea behind a cirsium and there are many plants in the front garden that were dwarfed by taller, more vigorous specimens this summer. One of my three scarlet ‘Beauty of Livermere’ poppies is actually white – and I want to replace the (enormous) everlasting sweet pea with a winter-flowering clematis.

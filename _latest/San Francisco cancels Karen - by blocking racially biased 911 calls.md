  San Francisco cancels Karen - by blocking racially biased 911 calls 
description: > 
  Racially-motivated 911 calls could be banned in San Francisco, where legislators have backed proposals dubbed the CAREN Act.All 11 members on San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors approved legislation banning racially-biased calls to 911 on Tuesday, CBS SF Bay Area reported, with a final vote due to take place next week on the “CAREN Act”.Also known as the Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, the proposals were introduced to the Board of Supervisors in July by Supervisor Shamann Walton.Those behaviours include racially motivated calls to 911, as seen when Amy Cooper, a white New York woman, called police on a black bird watcher with claims he had assaulted her in March.Under the CAREN Act, calls to 911 with the intent to discriminate over someone’s race, ethnicity, national origin, place of birth, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion is banned.

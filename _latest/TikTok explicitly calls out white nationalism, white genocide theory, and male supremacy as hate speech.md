<p>TikTok has overhauled its community guidelines to better tackle coded language and symbols that help spread hate speech.</p>
<p>The company announced in a blog post on Wednesday morning that it &#8220;will stem the spread of coded language and symbols that can normalize hateful speech and behavior.&#8221;</p> 
<p id="div-gpt-ad-456245625425492648-1" class="ad-container-in-content"></p>
 

<p>The announcement comes shortly after TikTok joined the European Commission&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Countering Illegal Hate Speech Online.</p>
<p>The company says it will address the spread of white nationalism, white genocide theory, Identitarianism (an anti-immigration movement spreading in parts of Europe and elsewhere), and male supremacy.</p><p id="in-content-mobile-streamad-slot"></p>
<p>Business Insider has previously reported that Identitarianism was linked to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-zealand-shooting-suspect-donated-money-to-an-austrian-far-right-group-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=TIR=T">2019 Christchurch shooting</a>, where a self-proclaimed fascist killed 49 people in a number of New Zealand mosques.</p><p id="in-content-dekstop-streamad-slot"></p><p id="ad7-container">

<h2>White supremacists have used TikTok to push their beliefs</h2>
<p>The app, which was <a href="https://www.adl.org/blog/extremists-are-using-a-range-of-techniques-to-exploit-tiktok">criticized in August by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)</a>, an organization devoted to tackling anti-Semitism and hate, has faced issues with white supremacists and nationalists using coded messages to perpetuate their beliefs.</p>
<p>The ADL highlighted examples of TikTok posters using hashtags like &#8220;2316&#8221; (the numeric symbol for white power) and &#8220;88&#8221;, which is often used to circumvent moderation and is linked to the phrase &#8220;Heil Hitler&#8221;.</p><h3 class="section-title">Lees ook op Business Insider</h3>

<p>&#8220;I do think this is an effort worth commending and it appears to be well aligned with what other platforms grappling with similar issues are tackling,&#8221; said Sabrina Ahmad, an MSc graduate from the Oxford Internet Institute who studied the cultural implications of content moderation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s worth acknowledging, however, the same way Facebook did that with any significant change in content moderation policies such as these, that TikTok won&#8217;t be getting it right the first time, and that there&#8217;s a good possibility that they won&#8217;t ever get it right fully.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok also said it would be taking &#8220;further action&#8221; to remove misinformation and hurtful stereotypes about Jewish, Muslim and other communities, including misinformation about prominent Jewish people, who are often subject to anti-Semitism.</p><p id="div-gpt-ad-25613-7" class="ad-container-in-content"></p>
 

<p>However, the app&#8217;s internal content moderation policies, used by those policing posts, already guards against this. A version of TikTok&#8217;s content moderation policies, dating from late 2019 and seen by Business Insider, encourage moderators to delete &#8220;content depicting stereotype of a protected or identifiable group&#8221; under its hate speech section.</p>
<p>At the same time, TikTok is also beefing up its response to anti-LGBTQ+ content, including any videos that promote conversion therapy.</p>
<p>TikTok declined to provide examples of the type of content it would be taking down as a result of the updated policies. Its announcement comes a week after Facebook announced it would ban Holocaust denial content, after the site&#8217;s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, confirmed his &#8220;thinking has evolved.&#8221;</p>
<h2>TikTok won&#8217;t ban communities who reclaim banned phrases</h2>
<p>The app says it is also introducing more nuance to its content to allow reclaiming of previously contentious words and phrases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Language previously used to exclude and demean groups of people is now being reclaimed by these communities and used as terms of empowerment and counter-speech,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>TikTok is trying to train its content moderation teams in different countries to understand better the nuance around the way these terms and phrases are used.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a member of a disenfranchised group, such as the LGBTQ+, Black, Jewish, Roma and minority ethnic communities, uses a word as a term of empowerment, we want our enforcement teams to understand the context behind it and not mistakenly take the content down,&#8221; the blog post read.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, if a slur is being used hatefully, it doesn&#8217;t belong on TikTok,&#8221; the company added. &#8220;Educating our enforcement teams on these crucial distinctions is ongoing work, and we strive to get this right for our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;TikTok&#8217;s efforts to train its moderators in cultural nuance and contextualizing speech is laudable, but a bit of a moving target,&#8221; said Ahmad. &#8220;These efforts would probably be more effective if they started hiring (or continued to hire) on-the-ground moderators who already belong to those communities or regions and who can better understand the evolution of speech and symbols within those groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>A former TikTok content moderator, who asked not to be named because they signed a non-disclosure agreement when departing the company, questioned whether this was truly a change in policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of that is new, alongside the policies that impact the distribution of LGBT content which are also not new,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Hate speech is hate speech and there isn&#8217;t sudden enforcement due to a new coalition, it was always against the policy.&#8221;</p>

A newborn baby found abandoned outside a Queens home over the weekend was allegedly thrown out of nearby a bathroom window by his mother who had just given birth, police said.

The baby was found laying naked in the front yard of a home on 126th St. near 107th Ave. in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens at around 10:15am Sunday morning.

The child was barely breathing and it's umbilical cord was still attached. Police sources told the NY Post that the child was also suffering from hypothermia.

First responders rushed the child to nearby Cohen Children’s Medical Center in a critical condition but officials say he’s not expected to survive.

A 23-year-old woman, who police believe to be the boy’s mother, was taken into custody shortly afterwards.

She remains in custody at the 106th Precinct, however she has not yet been named with charges against her still pending, an NYPD spokesperson told DailyMail.com.

Investigators determined that the infant’s mother had just given birth in the bathtub, and then tossed the baby out the bathroom window, according to the Post.

When contacted by DailyMail.com, the NYPD declined to identify the woman or address claims the baby was thrown from a bathroom window, citing an ongoing investigation.

The woman is said to have undergone a medical evaluation at Jamaica Hospital, before being transferred to the police precinct.

She will likely be charged with attempted murder, attempted manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment, tampering with evidence, abandonment of a child and endangering welfare of a child, sources said.

A spokesperson for the NYPD said additional details will be made available in the case shortly.

Authorities were alerted by a woman who lives next door to where the baby was found.

She told dispatchers that she had stepped outside of her home to empty the trash when she heard the baby’s cries from down the side of a neighboring property.

The woman added that she wasn't aware of a husband or boyfriend in the picture.

It's currently unclear how long the baby and been laying in the street for.

A video captured by a neighbor and uploaded the neighborhood watch app Citizen claimed the baby had been left outside of the home the previous evening.

New York State’s Abandoned Infant Protection Act allows a parent to abandon a newborn baby up to 30 days of age anonymously and without fear of prosecution, but only if the baby is abandoned in a safe manner and safe place.

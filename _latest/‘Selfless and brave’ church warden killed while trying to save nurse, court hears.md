<div><p>A &#8216;selfless and brave&#8217; church warden was beaten to death as he tried to stop another shopper from being stabbed, a court heard.</p>
<p>John Rees, 88, had left his wife Eunice, 87, in their car while he went inside a village Co-op to pick up essentials in May.</p>
<p>But he was stabbed in the face by mum-of-one Zara Anne Radcliffe, 30, when he found her attacking a nurse with a knife.</p>
<p>Brave Mr Rees saved nurse Gaynor Saurin when he tried to tackle Radcliffe.</p>
<p>But he was tragically stabbed himself - before Radcliffe then attacked him with a glass bottle and a fire extinguisher.</p>
<p>Mr Rees died inside the Co-op store and three other shoppers were injured in the frenzied attack in Penygraig in the Rhondda, South Wales.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Michael Jones QC described Mr Rees's efforts to stop Radcliffe as "A selfless and brave act which cost him his life."</p>
<p>He added: "Another customer, Lisa Way, attempted to talk to the defendant but she was attacked and injured by the knife.</p>
<p>"The defendant focused on Mr Rees and repeatedly attacked him with a glass wine bottle and a fire extinguisher as he laid on the floor."</p>
<p>Church warden Mr Rees was described as "the very definition of a good man, extremely respected and liked in the community" by his family.</p>
<p>His cause of death was recorded as severe blunt trauma to the face including multiple facial fractures.</p>
<p>Radcliffe admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility over the attack which happened in May.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, she was sentenced to indefinite hospital orders under sections 37 and 41 of the Mental Health Act by a judge at Merthyr Crown Court after pleading guilty to the manslaughter by diminished responsibility.</p>

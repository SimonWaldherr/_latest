Men In Alleged Kidnapping Plot Also Considered Targeting Virginia Governor, FBI Says

Some of the men who allegedly plotted to kidnap and possibly kill Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also considered targeting Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a FBI agent testified Tuesday in federal court.

The domestic terrorism case emerged last week, with militia members and others arrested for their alleged roles in a plot to kidnap Whitmer and put her on "trial" for the restrictions she has enacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Special Agent Richard Trask revealed the Virginia connection for the first time on Tuesday, adding new detail to a federal criminal complaint that was filed last week. According to that court document, several people who gathered in Dublin, Ohio., in early June "talked about state governments they believed were violating the U.S. Constitution, including the government of Michigan and Governor Gretchen Whitmer."

"Several members talked about murdering 'tyrants' or 'taking' a sitting governor," the complaint stated. Both Whitmer and Northam are Democrats.

Two of the people who were at that meeting — Adam Fox and Barry Croft – later made contact with a militia group in Michigan, Trask says.

The alleged domestic terrorism plot has prompted at least 13 arrests, including six men who face federal charges of conspiracy to commit kidnapping. Another seven men face state terrorism charges; they are either members of a group called Wolverine Watchmen or are associates of that militia.

"There has been a disturbing increase in anti-government rhetoric and the re-emergence of groups that embrace extremist ideologies," Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said on Thursday.

Nessel told NPR, "multiple white supremacy groups and militia groups have been acting in accordance with one another."

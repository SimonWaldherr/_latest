In any normal year, bargain-hungry shoppers wait until Black Friday to snap up Christmas presents. This year, however, the season of discounting has come six weeks early.

Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale, normally a staple of the summer, will kick off on Tuesday, offering members discounts on everything from headphones and TVs to beauty products and books.

‘Back-to-school’ items and holiday purchases are usually along the best-sellers. But this year, analysts say, Amazon Prime Day has turned into “an early lead-in to the Christmas season”.

It will act as “the starting gun” for what is set to be a huge quarter for Amazon, says Chris Elliott, a researcher at Edge by Ascential. While that's good news for the tech giant, many fear it could spell the end for some of Britain's struggling bricks-and-mortar retailers.

Already, 2020 has been among Amazon’s strongest years to date. Having initially warned Covid-19 would cause a loss, Amazon’s profits ended up doubling in the three months to the end of June. Its customer numbers racked even higher.

Meanwhile, footfall on UK high streets fell by 33pc in the last week of September compared to the same period last year, according to data from the British Retail Consortium and ShopperTrak.

Amazon Prime Day is expected to continue that trend of shopping forgoing the high-street for online purchases as concerns mount of a second wave of Covid-19. According to eMarketer, worldwide sales from Prime Day are expected to reach $9.91bn (£7.6bn), up 43pc on last year. In the UK, Britons will be spending around £1bn, according to estimates.

In part, the increased spending is likely to come from more customers having signed up for Prime during lockdown, which gives them access to the discounts.

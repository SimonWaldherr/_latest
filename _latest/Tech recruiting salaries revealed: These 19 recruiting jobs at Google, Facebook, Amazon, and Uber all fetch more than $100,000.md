<p>In the competitive tech industry where companies vye for top talent, recruiters play a big role in finding the right people.</p><p>"The role of the recruiters is simply to be a catalyst of growth for the companies they work for, specifically by helping them to have the best chance to hire the greatest people possible," said Matthew Strassberg of recruiting firm Skyrocket Ventures.&#160;</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic has changed the ways companies recruit: Most in-person interviews are now done entirely online, meaning that companies no longer need to fly candidates out and put them up in hotels. Remote work has also made many big-company perks and lavish campuses <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-work-big-company-perks-startup-hiring-easier-2020-5">virtually irrelevant</a>, evening the playing field between small startups and legacy tech companies.&#160;</p><p>Recruiters are sifting through an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-recruiting-coronavirus-pandemic-layoffs-hiring-2020-6">onslaught of job applications</a> from college graduates and laid-off tech workers, while the shift to remote work has also meant a broader market, according to Strassberg.</p><p>"When the coronavirus pandemic first started, we had a lot of companies saying they wanted to pause on hiring or slow down on hiring," Strassberg said. "What had a far greater effect is the possibility of remote work: Candidates are being targeted by companies all over the nation and all over the world."</p><p>To get a sense of what top tech companies pay their recruiting teams, Business Insider analyzed data from Sept. 21 2018 to March 24 2020 that firms are required to <a href="https://h1bdata.info/index.php">disclose data</a> to the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification for jobs with "talent acquisition," "recruiter," "recruit," and "staffing" in the job title.&#160;</p><p>The salaries are generally in the six figures &#8212; with companies like Dropbox and Uber showing salary ranges well over $200,000.</p><p>The data isn't a full representation of recruiter pay at these companies, as it only shows salaries for people that were hired through visa applications and reflects only base salary rather than total compensation for the positions. It's also worth noting that recruiters, like some sales positions, can have compensation packages that are commission-based. Still, it provides a rare window of insight into these salaries.&#160;</p>

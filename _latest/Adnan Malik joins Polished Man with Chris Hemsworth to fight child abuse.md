<div><p>Adnan Malik via an Instagram post explains that he is now the brand ambassador for Polished Man, a movement that sparks conversations about abuse and sexual violence against children. One billion children have experienced violence in the last year alone. That is almost half the world&#8217;s children. This month the movement is challenging men to paint one nail (any color) this will help attract attention and pursue meaningful conversation about the sad reality. The purpose is to inspire donations as well that will allow for trauma recovery and prevention for children around the globe.</p>

<p>Malik in the post stated:</p>

<p><strong><i>Every child deserves the right to feel safe and protected. But here we are in 2020 where officially more than 10 children a day in Pakistan subjected to sexual abuse and violence.And that&#8217;s probably a small fraction of it because most cases go unreported.</i></strong></p>

<p><strong><i>Too many childhoods are being ruined and the trauma of such abuse can last a lifetime. We need to break this subject wide open, to hear our children&#8217;s cries and vow to protect the children of this country from further abuse.</i></strong></p>

 

<p><strong><i>This October, men all over the country are coming together to say NO MORE to child violence and end the suffering. Join me and become part of this international campaign with other polished men- Chris Hemsworth, @wasimakramliveofficial, Harvey Spector, @realshoaibmalik and so many others.</i></strong></p>

<p><strong><i>I&#8217;m asking you to stand in solidarity and &#8220;Man Up&#8221; by Painting one or all of your nails and show Pakistan your softer side. Children stay strong in silence every day, there is nothing tougher than painting a nail for them.</i></strong></p>

<p>Other celebrities have also joined the movement and it is an encouraging sign.</p>

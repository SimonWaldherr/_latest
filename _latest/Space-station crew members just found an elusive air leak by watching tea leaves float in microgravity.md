<p>The International Space Station has been leaking an unusual amount of air since September 2019.</p><p>At first crew members held off on troubleshooting the issue, since the leak <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-narrows-source-of-leak-on-space-station-2-areas-2020-9">wasn't major</a>. But in August the leak rate increased, prompting astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the orbiting laboratory to try to locate its source in earnest.</p><p>Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, <a href="https://tass.com/science/1212465#:~:text=Russian%20cosmonauts%20trace%20air%20leak%20aboard%20orbital%20outpost%20with%20tea%20bag,-The%20tea%20bag's&amp;text=MOSCOW%2C%20October%2015.&amp;text=As%20Russia's%20State%20Space%20Corporation,the%20crew's%20life%20and%20health.">announced on Thursday</a> that crew members had finally pinpointed the leak after devising an unusual test: They let tea leaves guide their search.</p><p>The cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin released a few leaves from a tea bag in the transfer chamber of the Zvezda Service Module, the section of the station's Russian segment that houses a kitchen, sleeping quarters, and bathroom. Then the crew members sealed the chamber by closing its hatches and monitored the tea leaves on cameras as they floated in microgravity.</p>

<p>The leaves slowly floated toward a scratch in the wall near the module's communication equipment &#8212; evidence that it was a crack through which air was escaping.</p><p>The crew has since patched the leak using <a href="https://www.vesti.ru/article/2474302?utm_source=yxnews&amp;utm_medium=mobile">Kapton tape</a>, Roscosmos <a href="https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1318116197016227840">said on Monday</a>.</p><h2>A yearlong air leak on the space station</h2><p>

</p><p>The International Space Station <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/international-space-station-small-air-leak-nasa-says-no-danger-2020-8">always leaks a little air</a>. Normally, resupply missions carry highly pressurized containers with a mix of oxygen and nitrogen to replace the air the ISS loses. The mix is designed to mimic Earth's breathable air.</p><p>But in September 2019, the standard leak rate increased slightly. That wasn't considered a major risk, but by August that already elevated rate had increased fivefold, to 3.1 pounds of air per day from 0.6, the Russian news agency <a href="https://ria.ru/20201015/mks-1579976642.html">Ria Novosti reported</a>. So over the past two months, crew members <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-roscosmos-found-leak-on-international-space-station-2020-9">hunted for the leak</a> by isolating sections of the station and monitoring their pressure changes.</p>

<p>At first, crew members hunkered down in the Zvezda module while they tested the ship's other sections. When they couldn't find evidence of leaks in those sections, they determined that it was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-narrows-source-of-leak-on-space-station-2-areas-2020-9">likely in Zvezda itself</a>. Eventually, the astronauts and cosmonauts narrowed the source to Zvezda's transfer chamber. But they still couldn't find the leak's exact location.</p><p>

</p><p>Then came the tea-leaf trick.</p><p>"We believe that we have really identified the probable leakage area," Ivanishin said, <a href="https://tass.com/science/1212465#:~:text=Russian%20cosmonauts%20trace%20air%20leak%20aboard%20orbital%20outpost%20with%20tea%20bag,-The%20tea%20bag's&amp;text=MOSCOW%2C%20October%2015.&amp;text=As%20Russia's%20State%20Space%20Corporation,the%20crew's%20life%20and%20health.">according to Russia's TASS news agency</a>.</p><p>The tape the crew members put over the crack can remain stable and sticky across a wide range of temperatures, including the near absolute zero of space. But they think the tape is unlikely to hold for long and hope to replace it with a more reliable patch soon.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we should try hard patches our partners have? We can talk with them. This is because the current patch is not so efficient," a crew member said, <a href="https://tass.com/science/1212945">according to TASS</a>.</p><p>Roscosmos did not immediately respond to Business Insider's questions, but the agency <a href="https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1318116197016227840">said in a tweet</a> on Monday that it was "working out a program of operations to permanently seal the leak location."</p><p>A NASA representative, Daniel Huot, told Business Insider that the leak "continues to pose no immediate danger to the crew at the current leak rate."</p><h2>Not the first problem on the space station's Russian side</h2><p>The leak is one of several recent issues on the space station, which is starting to show its age after outlasting its <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/webcasts/shuttle/sts110/iss-qa.html">15-year life expectancy</a> by five years.</p>

<p>The station's Russian segment houses some of the station's oldest modules. In the past few months, it has seen <a href="https://balthazarkorab.com/2020/10/10/toilet-breaks-in-russian-module-on-iss/">a toilet go bust</a> and <a href="https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Temperature_Increasing_on_Russian_Zvezda_Module_as_Air_Continues_to_Leak_From_ISS_999.html">temperatures mysteriously increase</a>. On Wednesday, the segment's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/international-space-station-oxygen-supply-system-failure-2020-10">oxygen-supply system broke down</a>. Crew members had fixed the system by Saturday, Roscosmos said.</p><p>But in aggregate, the failures are indications that the Russian side of the ISS is probably in need of upgrades.</p><p>"All modules of the Russian segment are exhausted," Gennady Padalka, a cosmonaut, <a href="https://ria.ru/20201015/kosmos-1579901308.html">told Ria Novosti</a>.</p><p>This latest leak also wasn't the first on the Russian side. In August 2018, crew members <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/international-space-station-small-air-leak-nasa-says-no-danger-2020-8">discovered a 2-millimeter drill hole</a> in part of a Russian Soyuz spaceship that was docked to the station.</p><p>

</p><p>The hole seemed to stem from a manufacturing defect; someone on Earth had apparently plugged it with paint, hoping nobody would notice. The paint, it appeared, later broke off. Cosmonauts eventually patched that hole with an epoxy sealant.</p>

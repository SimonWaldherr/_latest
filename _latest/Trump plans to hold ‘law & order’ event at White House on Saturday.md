WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to deliver a speech from the White House balcony to hundreds of supporters on the South Lawn, his first in-person event since being hospitalized with the coronavirus a week ago.

The event is being touted as a gathering of “peaceful protesters” who will hear the president speak on law and order, a central tenet of his re-election campaign, according to a copy of the invitation first obtained by ABC News.

The gathering may coincide with a previously planned event organized by Candace Owens’ group Blexit, a campaign to urge Black Americans to leave the Democratic Party.

The commander-in-chief’s physician Dr. Sean Conley cleared Trump to begin taking part in campaign events from this Saturday after he was diagnosed with the deadly respiratory bug last Friday.

It’s still unclear whether the president is carrying COVID-19 and when he last tested negative for the disease which has killed more than 200,000 Americans.

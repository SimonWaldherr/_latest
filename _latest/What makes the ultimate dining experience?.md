Eating out is a treat, and with so much time spent at home now, it’s a joy to be offered a choice of dishes, to be served, and for someone else to tidy up afterwards. But many good restaurants are about more than just the food and service. Interiors play a huge role, though these days, there is no one-size-fits-all. Whether the environment is cosy or cavernous, restaurateurs are aiming to give diners an experience to remember. These are the places where the mood plays a key role. “I have huge admiration for transportive restaurant atmospheres,” says Rafael de Cárdenas, founder of New York studio Architecture at Large. “I like a dining experience that feels completely divorced from day-to-day life.”

- Why change is the key to a good life

- What does a ‘life of luxury’ really mean?

In his role as judge of the Dezeen Awards 2020, De Cardenas has been poring over this year’s restaurant entries. Now in their third year, these awards are organised by the high-profile architecture and design website, Dezeen, and feature projects from around the world. The restaurant category comprises venues which the judges deem beautiful and innovative. To set the mood, these places are employing beautifully-crafted local materials, subtle lighting, clever lay-out and warm colour palettes, alongside ambitious menus.

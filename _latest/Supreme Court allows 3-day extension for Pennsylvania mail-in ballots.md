<div><p>Pennsylvania ballots will be counted up to three days after Election Day, the Supreme Court ruled Monday in shooting down Republican opposition to the extension.</p>
<p>The 4-4 ruling by the court upholds a previous decision by the State Supreme Court that will allow ballots in the Keystone State to be counted up to Nov. 6, the Associated Press reported. Ballots that don&#8217;t have clear postmarks will also be counted under the ruling.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts joined with three liberal members of the court in blocking the GOP&#8217;s challenge to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court&#8217;s previous ruling. Opinions by the justices were not included in the ruling.</p>
<p>Republicans, including President Trump, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/10/federal-judge-dismisses-trumps-pennsylvania-ballot-lawsuit/">backed the challenge to Pennsylvania court&#8217;s ruling</a>, arguing it violates election law that states Election Day is the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November.</p>
<p>Democrats in the state had sought the extension because members of their party are requesting mail-in ballots by nearly a 3-to-1 ratio over GOP voters, according to the AP.</p>
<p>With the extension, ballots postmarked by the time polls close on Nov. 3 can be counted by 5 p.m. on Nov. 6.</p>

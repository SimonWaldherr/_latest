An Upper West Side duplex, once owned by late Cuban-born dance teacher Raoul Gelabert, is now on the market for $1.8 million.

The three-bedroom, two-bathroom home comes with its own entrance onto West 86th Street.

Gelabert bought his home in 1970 for around $70,000, sources say.

A 2,708-square-foot apartment that also served as a dance studio and art gallery, it features 23-foot-high ceilings and an open entertaining floor with a home office, a large, windowed kitchen, a fireplace and lots of storage.

Gelabert was a top dancer himself in the 1930s, before an injury caused him to move into teaching.

He trained New York City dancers for decades, including generations of members from the Joffrey Ballet.

Gelabert was also known as a pioneer of kinesiotherapy for dancers, an injury prevention and rehabilitation method that emphasizes correct technique, and penned the textbook “Anatomy for the Dancer.”

The dancer passed at age 94 in November of 2019 and the apartment has been empty ever since.

The listing broker for Gelabert’s apartment, located at 255-257 W. 86th St., is Corcoran’s Lydia Sussek.

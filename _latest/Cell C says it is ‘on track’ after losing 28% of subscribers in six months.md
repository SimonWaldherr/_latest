  Cell C says it is ‘on track’ after losing 28% of subscribers in six months 
description: > 
  Cell C is still in an "informal" debt standstill, it said on Tuesday, while it prioritises recapitalisation.In the first half of 2020, it lost 28% of its combined subscriber base, and 35% of its prepaid users.That was in part, Cell C said, because its focus on profitable subscribers rather than growth saw a 27% increase in its average revenue per user (ARPU) in its prepaid base.At R66, that Cell C prepaid ARPU is now exactly equal to the last number reported by the furiously-growing Telkom for its prepaid mobile base.Cell C said its principal short-term debt now stand at R9.7 billion, with total liabilities standing at R23.2 billion, while its assets are worth R7.7 billion.

                                <p>Cell C's strategy is to "rationalise its subscriber base and retain profitable customers", it said, instead of counting SIM cards, and that has seen it increase average revenue per user and gross margins. Despite the plummet in subscribers &#8211; and a net loss of R7.6 billion, an average loss of well over R1 billion per month &#8211; its total revenues were down only 8% compared to the first half of 2019.</p><p>That was in part, Cell C said, because its focus on profitable subscribers rather than growth saw a 27% increase in its average revenue per user (ARPU) in its prepaid base.</p><p>At R66, that Cell C prepaid ARPU is now exactly equal to the last number reported by the furiously-growing Telkom for its prepaid mobile base.

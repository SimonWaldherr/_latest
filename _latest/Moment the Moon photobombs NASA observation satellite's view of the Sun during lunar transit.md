  Moment the Moon photobombs NASA observation satellite's view of the Sun during lunar transit 
description: > 
  The moon stole the show from the sun during its lunar transit.The transit lasted for about 50 minutes and at its peak, the moon covered 44 percent the fiery surface.Scroll down for videosThe moon stole the show from the sun during its lunar transit.The latest Solar Cycle 25 appears to have started in December 2019 and experts say it will peak in 2025.‘This apparent crossing in space, called a lunar transit, lasted about 50 minutes, between 3:05pm and 3:53pm ET,’ NASA shared in a statement.

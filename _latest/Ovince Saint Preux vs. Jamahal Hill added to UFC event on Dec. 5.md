<div><p>A light heavyweight fight has been added to the UFC&#8217;s first event in December 2020.</p>
<p>Longtime 205-pound staple <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/ovince-saint-preux">Ovince Saint Preux</a> returns to action Dec. 5 against Dana White&#8217;s Contender Series alumnus <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/jamahal-hill">Jamahal Hill</a>. The event is expected to take place at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Multiple sources recently informed MMA Junkie of the fight but asked to remain anonymous as the promotion has yet to make an official announcement. <a href="https://cagesidepress.com/2020/10/21/ufc-ovince-saint-preux-vs-jamahal-hill-targeted-december-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cageside Press</a> was the first to report the news.</p>
<p>Saint Preux (25-14 MMA, 15-10 UFC) picked up a $50,000 &#8220;Performance of the Night&#8221; bonus in his most recent fight after knocking out Alonzo Menifield. The victory was Saint Preux&#8217;s return to both the win column and the light heavyweight division after a heavyweight split decision loss to Ben Rothwell in May.</p>
<p>Hill (8-0 MMA, 2-0 UFC) has won both of his UFC appearances to date after punching his ticket into the UFC on DWCS, Season 3 in 2019. After defeating Darko Stosic in his debut, Hill finished Klidson Abreu with strikes in 1:51 in May.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Shortly after the news of the booking surfaced, Saint Preux announced on Twitter he&#8217;s signed a new contract with the UFC in addition to his bout agreement.</p>

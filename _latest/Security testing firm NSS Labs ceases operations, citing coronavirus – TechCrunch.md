<div><p id="speakable-summary">Security testing company NSS Labs &#8220;ceased operations&#8221; last week, the company said in a notice on its website, citing impacts related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Austin, Texas-based company was <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/252478026/NSS-Labs-quietly-acquired-by-private-equity-firm">quietly acquired</a> by private equity firm Consecutive last October. But last week, the company was reportedly preparing for layoffs, according to Dark Reading, which <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/nss-labs-shuttered/d/d-id/1339220">first reported</a> news of the company&#8217;s shuttering.</p>
<p>In a brief post on LinkedIn, NSS Labs&#8217; chief executive Jason Brvenik hinted at layoffs, adding: &#8220;If you are in need of excellent people that exceed my high standards, please get in touch.&#8221; (Brvenik listed himself as a former chief executive on his LinkedIn profile.)</p>
<p>Former employees told TechCrunch that they had been laid off as a result of the company&#8217;s closure.</p>
<p>NSS Labs, founded in 2007, was one of the most well-known product security testing companies, allowing customers to use real threat data to stress-test their products and discover potential vulnerabilities and security issues.</p>
<p>But the last few years have been rocky. NSS Labs retracted its &#8220;caution&#8221; rating for CrowdStrike&#8217;s Falcon platform in 2019, after the two companies confidentially settled a lawsuit challenging the results. NSS Labs also dropped its antitrust suit against the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO), Symantec and ESET, after the testing giant claimed it had discovered evidence of the companies allegedly conspiring to make it harder to test their products.</p>

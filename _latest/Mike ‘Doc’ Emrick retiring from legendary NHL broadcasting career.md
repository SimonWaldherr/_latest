<div><p>Say it ain&#8217;t so, Doc!</p>
<p>Mike &#8220;Doc&#8221; Emrick, the incomparable Voice of the NHL, Monday morning will retire, as per a shared announcement with NBC Sports.</p>
<p>Emrick, 74, rose from calling college and minor league hockey radio broadcasts to develop an enthralling style that emphasized superior, often mesmerizing play-by-play: Original on-the-fly, bull&#8217;s-eye descriptions; a great knowledge of the game; current and past anecdotal info, timed to perfection; strong, warm relationships with his color analysts; and a modest charm that radiated as real. He forced nothing. He just knew how to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I can handle retirement OK,&#8221; he said Sunday night from his home in Michigan, &#8220;especially since I&#8217;ve never done it before. But I&#8217;ve just been extremely lucky for 50 years. And NBC has been so good to me, especially since the pandemic, when I was allowed to work from home in a studio NBC created.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, into my golden years, this just seemed to be the time that was right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plus, I&#8217;ve now accumulated enough frequent-flyer miles &#8212; to not go anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest tributes to Emrick have been paid by non-hockey fans, often women, who, while hearing Emrick in passing, asked, &#8220;Who is this guy? He&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221;</p>
<p>Emrick was the rarest of TV announcers in that his presence could entice us to watch then even stick with blowouts, rather than risk losing what he might say.</p>
<p>Born in Indiana and still a devoted Pittsburgh Pirates fan from listening to Bob Prince over KDKA Radio, Emrick is a 19-year cancer survivor. He earned his Ph.D and nickname in broadcasting while at Bowling Green. He and his wife, Joyce, plus dogs and horses, have for years lived in Michigan.</p>
<p>There is nothing Emrick hasn&#8217;t done on behalf of hockey, including becoming the founder of the NHL&#8217;s increasingly valued NHL [players&#8217;] Pronunciation Guide, and never turning down an interview request including &#8212; and especially &#8212; from high school kids who aspire to careers in broadcasting.</p>
<p>Emrick is in, at last count, seven halls of fame.</p>
 
<p>That he&#8217;d establish himself as an East Coast voice &#8212; Hershey Bears, Maine Mariners, Flyers, Rangers&#8217; radio, Devils &#8212; before ESPN, CBS and finally NBC &#8212; was this region&#8217;s great fortune.</p>
<p>On a personal, off-air basis, Emrick is the ultimate mensch. A deacon in the Methodist Church, his gentle sense of humor and unyielding patience and respect for all creates envy for a life well-lived, with plenty left to give.</p>
<p>Emrick once met flattery with the suggestion that folks name their progeny &#8220;Doc&#8221; by saying &#8220;as long as it&#8217;s not Grumpy, Dopey or Sleepy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Flood, executive producer of NBC Sports, put it very well: &#8220;Doc is a national treasure. Simply put, he&#8217;s one of the best ever to put on a headset.&#8221;</p>

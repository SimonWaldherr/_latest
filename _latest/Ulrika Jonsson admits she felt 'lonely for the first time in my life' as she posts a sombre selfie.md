Leslie confirmed he would not sue Wright, saying: 'I think he just made a really big mistake and unfortunately I was the one paying the price.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jonsson made no public comment on Leslie's naming and did not cooperate with police over the matter. Police investigated Leslie but never charged him with the alleged offence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other women have made claims of indecent assault against Leslie, and he was&#160;arrested in December 2002 on one count of rape and two concerning indecent assault, before being released on bail after an interview.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In June 2003, he was charged with assaulting a woman twice between May 25 and 28 1997.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The charges were dropped at Southwark Crown Court on July 31 2003 after new information emerged about the alleged victim.&#160;</p><img id="i-bed09b1e67f41834" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="520" width="306" alt="A sex tape of Leslie in a threesome with his girlfriend Abi Titmus (pictured) and another woman was leaked onto the internet" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-bed09b1e67f41834" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/11/34578732-8858685-A_sex_tape_of_Leslie_in_a_threesome_with_his_girlfriend_Abi_Titm-a-14_1603190003000.jpg" height="520" width="306" alt="A sex tape of Leslie in a threesome with his girlfriend Abi Titmus (pictured) and another woman was leaked onto the internet" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p></p> <p></p><p class="imageCaption">A sex tape of Leslie in a threesome with his girlfriend Abi Titmus (pictured) and another woman was leaked onto the internet&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leslie later appeared on the court steps where he said, while visibly shaking:&#160;'I am an innocent man.

'That was when I realised I was earning decent money.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He then started presenting Wheel of Fortune, initially filming three shows a week at &#163;2,000 a show. His income was further boosted to &#163;350,000 a year when, in 2001, he began presenting This Morning with Fern Britton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While he was at Blue Peter, he dated the actress Catherine Zeta-Jones for 18 months, admitting in later years that she was the only woman he ever truly loved.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I should have been far more responsible, sensitive and aware,' he has said. 'Someone said if I'd been a rock star it would have been accepted, whereas because I was a Blue Peter presenter, people were out to get me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I didn't know how to handle my private life. The party was 24/7 and I trusted too many people, and soon enough the wheels were going to come off.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2003,&#160;Leslie famously left the court having been told that he did so 'without a stain on his character'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the damage had been done. Photographs had emerged of him taking cocaine, and a stolen sex tape of a threesome involving Leslie and his then girlfriend Abi Titmuss, a nurse who went on to become a glamour model, was leaked on the internet.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With a &#163;500,000 legal bill to pay, and with ITV having ended his contract, Leslie was forced to look elsewhere for funds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No doubt imagining that his career would one day be revived, he turned his hand to property developing. After all, he had already overseen the construction of his multimillion-pound dream home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But while it has been reported that he made a fortune by renovating several flats and a nursing home in London, it seems he was hit hard by the 2008 financial crash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After renting out his bachelor pad for a number of years, in 2010 Leslie had no choice but to part with it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I pleaded with the bank to let me keep the Richmond house but was forced to sell it for &#163;3.5million when the crash hit and the bank wanted its money back,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I paid them back every penny, but there was nothing left.

He, with open arms, welcomed me aboard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'John is somebody historically who always had a smile on his face, and was the most welcoming person.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I like to say that he's the type of person who was brought up to share his toys. When you're a television presenter you get two types of people. You get the person who wants to drop you in it, letting you die in front of the camera.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Or you get the person that is a real pal, and that is John.

Afterwards I think it's really sad, those who are friends of John, saw this amazing person just crumple.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added: 'He became very much the person who wanted to be with people he knew.

He was extremely kind to me. He's a larger than life character, always overbrimming with life in him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's just a fun gorgeous person to be around. He has that exceptional quality of deep empathy and deep kindness. I can't describe how supportive and loving he was.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added: 'I'm not really a showbizzy type person. I actually really dislike the limelight.

Appearing via video link, she said: 'There was this one particular time when we were filming Blue Peter in one of the locations when we would go abroad, we went to Zimbabwe and were gone for six weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We shared a hut in the middle of the African bush for 10 days. John was incredibly gentlemanly. He would turn away every time I had to change.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If it was the middle of the night, and I had to go to the ladies restroom, I was scared to death of peeing in the bush and he would shine a torch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He averted his eyes when I had to go to the lavatory. In all the years I've known John he's been a lovely lovely person.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I considered him to be a brother to me. We would spend many many times going to nightclubs and going to parties and never ever in the times I've known John seen him behave in a disrespectful way to any woman or man.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added: 'I've seen women going up to him and squeezing his bum in bars, and he's been the one to pat them away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He'd just laugh and move on and in fact being popular on television, he was a young handsome man, he was inundated with lots of ladies and I've seen them throw themselves at him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's been a gentleman, he's always been lovely.

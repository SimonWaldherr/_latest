<p>On Sunday, Holzmacher traveled to Indianapolis, where she watched Burrow and the Bengals take on the Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open the moon roof kinda day,&#8221; Holzmacher captioned one post, before showing off her Cincinnati gear in another.</p>
 
<p>Burrow, the first overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, finished Sunday&#8217;s loss with 313 yards and one interception. The Bengals currently stand at 1-4-1 on the season.</p>
<p>Last month, Holzmacher &#8212; who has been linked to Burrow since 2017 &#8212; celebrated his NFL debut, posting a photo of her cardboard cutout from Cincinnati&#8217;s Paul Brown Stadium.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a fan cheers in a crowd and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? YES&#128548;&#128548; who&#128483; dey &#128483;&#128005;&#128005;,&#8221; she captioned the shot.</p>
<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, some NFL stadiums have prohibited fans from attending games. Fortunately for Holzmacher, she has been able to see her favorite player in action this year.</p>

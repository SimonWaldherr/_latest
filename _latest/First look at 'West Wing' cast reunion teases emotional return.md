(CNN) The cast and set might look a little different, but the "West Wing" is ready to show its message is timeless.

A trailer for HBO Max's "West Wing" special was unveiled on Thursday, teasing the episode remake's stage adaptation for the first time. (HBO Max, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)

It opens with the show's familiar and comforting score and takes viewers behind the scenes of the production, put together to benefit When We All Vote.

It's the first time in 17 years the original cast have gathered together for a creative effort.

The trailer offers glimpses at Dul√© Hill, Allison Janney, Rob Lowe, Janel Moloney, Richard Schiff, Bradley Whitford, and Martin Sheen, as well as Sterling K. Brown as Leo McGarry. John Spencer, who played Leo on the series, died in 2005.

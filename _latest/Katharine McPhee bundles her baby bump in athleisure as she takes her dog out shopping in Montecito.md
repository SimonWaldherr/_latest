Katharine McPhee is happily expecting her very first child with husband David Foster.

But the singer/actress spent time with her a fur baby on Tuesday, seen out walking around Montecito, California with her dog Larry in a purse.

The American Idol alum, 36, bundled up her bump in snug athleisure, pairing a fitted baseball tee with wine red Alo yoga pants and a baseball hat.

Katharine clutched her quilted bag tightly through out her walk, making sure little Larry was safe and sound. She kept her own things in a Chanel crossbody bag slung across her back.

Though it was difficult to spot, McPhee could be seen dressing up her look with a gold 'Foster' necklace.

The Broadway talent wore a mask under her chin while out, largely defeating the purpose of the face covering.

During her outing Katharine indulged in some shopping at the upscale clothing establishment K. Frank in the neighboring city of Santa Barbara.

The Smash Star slyly confirmed she was expecting while posting about a gift she recieved from Italian cocktail favorite Aperol last week.

Katharine said she won't be having this anytime soon, adding a 'wink, wink' while showing off the spirited present.

Katharine said: I just came home and opened this gift from Aperol Spritz... it's one of my favorite drinks and it reminds you of being in Capri.'

'I won't be drinking this anytime soon, wink, wink. But I'm very excited. Who's coming over for an Italian inspired cocktail?'

The gift contained the aperitif as well as sparkling water and two wine glasses.

<div><p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Two Republican lawmakers leading the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/biden-sen-johnson-should-be-ashamed-for-alleged-corruption-probe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Congressional probe</a> into Hunter Biden&#8217;s overseas business dealings have asked the Secret Service to provide more records of his travel while his father was vice president.</p>
<p>In a letter <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10-20%20CEG%20RHJ%20to%20Secret%20Service%20%28Hunter%20Biden%20Travel%20Records%20Follow-Up%29%20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sent to the agency&#8217;s director</a> on Wednesday, GOP Sens. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wi) said bombshell Hunter Biden emails <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">revealed by The Post last week</a> &#8220;aligned&#8221; with the scandal-scarred son&#8217;s previous Secret Service travel logs.</p>
<p>&#8221;Recent reports have published emails allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden, some of which include references to Mr. Biden&#8217;s travel,&#8221; the letter read.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the Committees continue to assess the validity of these emails, Committee staff have found that several of the references to Mr. Biden&#8217;s travel align with the travel records USSS produced to the Committees,&#8221; it went on.</p>
<p>Johnson and Grassley, the respective chairs of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, noted two emails from Hunter Biden&#8217;s recovered hard drive matched with logs they obtained earlier this year.</p>
<p>In one email from Biden to his business partner Devon Archer on April 13, 2014, the then-VP&#8217;s son referenced traveling to Houston &#8220;tmrw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Secret Service records show a travel entry for Mr. Biden from April 13, 2014 &#8211; April 14, 2014, to Houston, TX,&#8221; the letter read.</p>
<p>In a May 12 email from the same year, Vadim Pozharskyi, a top advisor to Ukrainian energy company Burisma, mentioned a trip he had taken to Lake Como in Italy with Biden and Archer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Following our talks during the visit to the Como Lake&#160;and our further discussions, I would like to bring the following situation to your attention,&#8221; Pozharskyi wrote.</p>
<p>Secret Service records show a travel entry for Biden to Lake Como between April 3-6, 2014.</p>
<p>Pozharskyi is the same Ukrainian businessman who Biden allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced to his father</a>, then-Vice President Joe Biden, less than a year before the elder Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire the prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, according to the emails obtained by The Post.</p>
<p>The tranche of documents reveal how Hunter Biden sought to leverage his father&#8217;s influence to conduct lucrative deals with overseas executives and <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/hunter-biden-emails-show-leveraging-connections-with-dad-to-boost-burisma-pay/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sought to boost his pay</a> as a member of the Burisma board, despite having no experience in Ukraine or the energy sector.</p>
<p>In a carefully-worded statement, the Biden campaign denied the Democratic nominee has ever had an <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/biden-campaign-says-burisma-meeting-not-on-official-schedule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&#8220;official&#8221; meeting</a> with Pozharskyi, but later admitted they couldn&#8217;t rule-out whether the two men had ever met.</p>

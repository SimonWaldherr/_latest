Once you find a character you’d like to recruit, you can start a short mission with them. That can be anything from investigating someone that your newly recruited character owes money to, collecting a supercar or simply heading down to the pub for a pint of roasting hot beer and some light assault charges.

It’s a really impressive mechanic, but the apparent lack of handcrafted characters raises a few issues. One of the people I recruited was a middle-aged getaway driver with the patter of a mouthy teenager but the look of a Chelsea home-owning oligarch. I’m not sure if it was intentional or a result of lazy character development.

Another issue is the amount of pronoun-heavy dialogue. There are so many non-specific references to characters. Obviously the creators couldn’t record a line of dialogue with every single name in the game, but it’s noticeable that you’re rarely, if ever, referred to by name.

The moment-to-moment gameplay involving sneaking around, deciding how to hack various buildings and using your phone to make cars spin in circles is largely the same as Watch Dogs 2. However, this is no bad thing. I loved Watch Dogs 2 so expanding on that, with new tools and methods of infiltration, is great.

Each recruited character will also have unique traits. That can be access to certain buildings due to their status, a proficiency in hacking that rapidly opens doors and unlocks terminals or a proficiency in martial arts where kind, old women can roundhouse like Bruce Lee.

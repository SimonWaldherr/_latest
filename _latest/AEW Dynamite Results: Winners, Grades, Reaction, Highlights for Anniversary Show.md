Darby Allin was shown watching from the crowd as Cody made his entrance for the TNT title match. Cody tried to get Cassidy to engage with him but the slacker kept avoiding contact.

Freshly Squeezed teased locking up before putting his hands in his pockets. The American Nightmare shoved him back and Cassidy decided it was time to try. He forced Cody to the corner and made a clean break. The champ immediately took control with a rear waistlock but OC broke free with a unique counter.

You could see Cody felt disrespected by Cassidy's attitude as the show went to a commercial. As the match progressed during the break, you could see Cassidy putting more effort into the match as Cody became more vicious.

OC avoided a double ax handle and hit his trademark low kicks. Cody responded with an uppercut but Cassidy fired back with a superkick and a suicide dive. John Silver ran down and tried to attack Cassidy with the TNT belt but he failed and the entire Dark Order was booted from ringside. He handed the belt to Arn Anderson before rolling Cody into the ring.

The challenger hit a couple of his signature moves but every time he hit one, the champ responded with a more impactful maneuver. He dragged Cassidy to the corner and slammed his knee into the ring post. He applied a half crab submission but let go when he couldn't maintain the hold.

The American Nightmare hit a reverse superplex from the top rope but Cassidy still kicked out at two. OC hit a diving DDT from the middle rope and a Michinoku driver for a pair of two-counts.

OC hit a beautiful tornado DDT followed by a Beach Break but Cody did not stay down for the pin. As the announcer informed them they had less than a minute left, Cassidy rolled Cody up. The ref counted to two before the bell rang due to the time expiring. OC was less than a second away from winning the title.

Grade: A-

Analysis

This was easily the best performance Cassidy has had in AEW. It even managed to outdo his Mimosa Mayhem match with Jericho in terms of the quality of wrestling.

Cody almost played the heel by default even if he wasn't employing a lot of illegal tactics. He showed some anger, broke a few rules and almost seemed like he wanted to make an example out of Cassidy for what he saw as disrespectful behavior.

This match told just as much of a story as they could have with a couple of weeks of buildup. These two make great opponents and it would be a shame if this was just a one-off encounter.

The time limit draw finish was a good way to keep both men looking good. We don't see this kind of ending very often so it doesn't feel like a cheap finish the way a DQ would have.

<p>     </p> <p>However, the region's leaders have demanded more support from the government, including raising the 67% furlough for shut-down workers back to the original 80% and giving proper wage support to the self-employed.</p> <p> Ms Qureshi posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>: "Two weeks ago, I began to feel unwell. I then tested positive for COVID-19, so my family and I immediately self-isolated at home. </p> <p>"I have not travelled to Westminster or anywhere else.</p> <p>"I continued to work as best I could remotely, attending virtual meetings and doing casework, but after 10 days, I began to feel much worse and on Saturday I was admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital with pneumonia.&#160;</p> <p>"I'm being very well looked after and have nothing but praise and admiration for the wonderful staff at the hospital.</p>

<img alt="A woman has been charged after allegedly punching a nurse and spitting at two security guards at Royal Bolton Hospital.
Police confirmed on social media that they were called to the incident at the hospital yesterday.
According to witnesses at the hospital, the woman punched the nurse in the stomach.
Louise Adams, 58, has been charged with three assaults on emergency service workers.
She has been remanded in custody until the next available court date.">

 

 <p>"They have been amazing throughout the process and I would like to extend my thanks to everyone working here in such difficult circumstances."</p> <p>She added to constituents: "Although I am currently in hospital, my staff are continuing to work as normal &#8211; if you have any issues that you need help with, please get in touch by contacting the office."</p> <p>Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a> tweeted: "My thoughts are with my friend @YasminQureshiMP who has been admitted to hospital after being diagnosed with Covid-19.</p> <p>"My thanks go to the staff caring for Yasmin at the Royal Bolton Hospital, along with NHS staff across the country who are on the frontline against Covid-19."</p> <p>It comes after a Tory minister declared a deal over whether to put Greater Manchester in Tier 3 lockdown should be reached "today or tomorrow". </p> <p>Robert Jenrick set the ultimatum after "constructive" talks between metro mayor Andy Burnham and the Government last night.</p> <p>The Communities Secretary insisted the time frame was not an "arbitrary deadline" and he wanted all sides to agree - amid suggestions No10 will offer the region around &#163;75m.</p> <p>Tier 3 lockdown restrictions could also be announced for Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford, Kirklees and York today.</p> <p>Local leaders and government officials have been in ongoing talks over the course of the weekend as coronavirus cases across the region remain high.</p> <p>With more talks due with&#160;Greater Manchester today, Mr Jenrick warned he could still impose Tier 3 restrictions against Greater Manchester's will if talks break down.&#160; </p> <p>A document leaked to the Guardian warns the region is at risk of running out of hospital beds for the most seriously ill, with 211 of 257 critical care beds in use by Friday.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>But Mr Burnham yesterday accused <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> of exaggerating the situation in the region as he held out against further restrictions.</p> <p>He and local Tory leaders have refused to accept Tier 3 without more government cash - including lifting the 67% wage support for shut-down workers to 80%, and giving 80% support to the self-employed.</p> <p>He is thought to be prepared to offer Greater Manchester leaders tens of millions of pounds to soften the financial blow of going into the highest level of lockdown.</p> <p>But it falls short of the region&#8217;s demand for the new jobs furlough scheme to be as generous as the 80% paid out earlier this year.</p></div>

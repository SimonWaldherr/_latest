<div><p>President Donald Trump was so &#8220;steaming mad&#8221; after <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/21/trump-tweets-pics-from-fake-lesley-stahl-60-minutes-interview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview with Lesley Stahl on Tuesday</a>, he tried to cut short his following appearance, a much friendlier town hall with Eric Bolling for Sinclair Broadcast Group.</p>
<p>Sources say that Trump was &#8220;90 minutes late for the Sinclair town hall. And he was furious &#8212; in a really s&#8211;tty mood. It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear at Sinclair what had transpired at &#8216;60 Minutes,&#8217; but he clearly wanted to get the hell out of the town hall and away from the media, even the more sympathetic media.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Sinclair town hall source said Trump didn&#8217;t directly bash veteran CBS interviewer Stahl, but &#8220;he did reference Tony Fauci going on &#8216;60 Minutes&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;not a very good show.&#8217;&#8202;&#8221;</p>
<p>CBS insiders said <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/trump-tweets-video-of-mask-free-lesley-stahl-after-60-minutes-interview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump&#8217;s fiery interview with Stahl ended early</a> after she repeatedly questioned him on his response to the COVID-19 pandemic and his lack of transparency over his own medical condition after contracting the disease. Trump proceeded to launch an attack against the interviewer on Twitter for not wearing a mask, and also threatened to post the interview before it aired. Sinclair did not comment.</p>

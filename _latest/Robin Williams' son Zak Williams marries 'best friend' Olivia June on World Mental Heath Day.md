Zak Williams, the eldest son of the late Robin Williams, celebrated his marriage to "best friend" and partner Olivia June in Los Angeles Saturday.

The joyful event was made all the more precious for mental health advocate Williams, 37, coming on World Mental Health Day.

"I had the great joy of marrying my best friend @oliviajune today! It went awesome and we couldn’t have tied the knot on a better day," Williams tweeted Saturday, alongside a selfie of the couple. He added the hashtag #WorldMentalHealthDay.

June, an entrepreneur and social scientist, posted a photo of the outdoor wedding reception and menu on her Instagram account, writing, "Hands down the best mental health decision of my life was to choose Zak." The wedding menu included seared snapper, wild arugula salad and "love" for dessert.

June posted photos on her Instagram stories showing her resplendent white gown, while Williams donned a black tuxedo. "Just married," she wrote over the photo.

On Monday, June posted more wedding photos while explaining that the couple organized their "dream" wedding amid a pandemic in just weeks.

"One of my favorite things about Zak and my relationship is that we make the most out of whatever life gives us, and that we both love living on our own timeline and on our own terms," June wrote.

"With 2 weeks notice, we asked a few of our closest family and friends to get tested and invited them to the dreamy Paramour Estate for a ceremony, outdoor dinner and some joyful moments in an otherwise very trying year," she wrote. "With so much love and pride, I’m officially Mrs. Williams, and my very best friend @zakpym is now my husband."

Williams has devoted his work to mental health awareness following his own personal trauma and loss following the 2014 death by suicide of his father, Oscar-winning comedian/actor Robin Williams.

"I experienced a serious low point in my life. I felt completely emotionally dis-regulated and was experiencing PTSD. I was self-medicating to the point where I wanted to not feel anything. I found that the most healing experience for me was committing to service around causes," Zak told ABC News in March.

In May 2019, Zak and Olivia welcomed a baby boy named McLaurin Clement Williams. The baby's first name is a nod to Robin Williams, whose middle name was McLaurin.

"I have slowly started showing photos and pictures to my son, things from movies and in animation that my dad was in," Williams said on the "Today" show in July. "We have photos and memories around our home and he's drawn to them. And so when he sees the Genie from 'Aladdin' or when he sees a photo of his grandfather, he's drawn to it. And so we talk about it. It's a nice way to carry on my dad's legacy related to our family history."

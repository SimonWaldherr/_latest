<p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) claimed that coronavirus was accelerating changes to the world of work,&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/09/25/mass-unemployment-will-convulse-politics/">fuelling the threat of long-term joblessness</a> for British workers unless they are given new skills.</p>
<p>Research conducted by the CBI before the pandemic hit suggested that around nine in 10 workers would have already needed new skills within the next 10 years to support the economy, at an additional cost of &#163;13bn every year.&#160;</p>
<p>The group said that jobs were&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/30/will-software-service-solve-productivity-crisis/">"already changing"</a>, but that Covid-19, which has&#160;seen vast numbers of staff shifted to remote working&#160;and factories double&#160;down on <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/robots/">robotics</a>,&#160;had "accelerated the&#160;need to act now".&#160;</p>
<p>CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said: "Failure to act will leave business facing skills shortages and workers facing long-term unemployment. We are at a fork in the road that requires urgent and decisive&#160;action."</p>

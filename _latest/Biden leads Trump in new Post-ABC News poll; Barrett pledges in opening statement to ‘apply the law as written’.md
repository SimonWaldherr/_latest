Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday that the Trump campaign used his words out of context and without his permission in a new TV ad.

“In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,” Fauci said in a statement to CNN. “The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.”

The new Trump campaign ad, released Saturday, includes a clip of Fauci speaking during an interview with conservative Fox News host Mark Levin in late March.

During the interview, Levin asked Fauci about the coordinated response of the Trump administration.

“The coordinated response has been — there are a number of adjectives to describe it. ‘Impressive,' I think, is one of them,” Fauci said. “I mean, we’re talking about all hands on deck.”

In his response, Fauci noted that he is “one of many people on a team” and spoke at length about the long hours that he and others within the administration have been putting in while working on combating the pandemic.

“There’s a whole group of us that are doing that,” Fauci said. “It’s every single day. So I can’t imagine that under any circumstances, that anybody could be doing more. I mean, obviously, we’re fighting a formidable enemy, this virus.”

Even though Fauci did not mention Trump in his answer, the Trump campaign clip is edited to make it appear that the nation’s top infectious-disease expert is praising the president’s personal leadership during the crisis.

Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh defended the use of the Fauci clip.

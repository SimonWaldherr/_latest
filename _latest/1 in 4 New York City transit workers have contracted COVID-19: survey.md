<div><p>One in four New York City transit workers report having had COVID-19 at some point this year, according to a poll commissioned by the MTA&#8217;s largest union.</p>
<p>The TWU Local 100 survey &#8212; conducted by NYU epidemiologist Robyn Gershon &#8212; polled 645 city transit workers, 24 percent of whom reported contracting the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Of the workers surveyed, 90 percent said they fear contracting the virus at work.</p>
<p>Transit workers repped by TWU were the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/25/nyc-transit-leaders-blast-mtas-failed-coronavirus-response/">hardest hit</a> by the virus among MTA workers, accounting for more than 90 of the 131 agency employees killed by the deadly respiratory illness.</p>
<p>In March and April, thousands of workers called out sick, forcing massive <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/21/sick-mta-workers-caused-subway-cancelations-during-coronavirus-peak/">subway cancellations</a>.</p>
<p>The MTA, meanwhile, was slow to institute protective measures demanded by workers, and initially prohibited employees from wearing masks at all, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/08/mta-blames-who-cdc-as-its-coronavirus-death-toll-mounts/">citing CDC guidance</a> at the time.</p>
<p>Transit officials have since instituted a mask mandate &#8212; now <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/07/subway-mask-wearing-rose-after-50-fines-began-mta-says/">backed up by a $50 fine</a> &#8212; along with protective measures for bus drivers and expanded break-room space.</p>
<p>&#8220;We put the city on our shoulders when the pandemic hit, and we are still carrying it forward,&#8221; union president Tony Utano said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to stay vigilant, and push forward with new and better ways to defend out blue-collar heroes still moving millions of riders a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>MTA rep Abbey Collins disputed the survey&#8217;s findings, which she dismissed as &#8220;a poll, not a study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This individual surveyed a fraction of the NYC Transit workforce, and captured only those who were most motivated to participate,&#8221; Collins said.</p>
<p>Collins said antibody studies of city transit workers had found an overall infection rate of 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The self-reported nature of this poll would unquestionably also drive the numbers higher,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope any future &#8216;study&#8217; is based on science, data and facts as the MTA&#8217;s highest priority remains the safety of our workforce.&#8221;</p>

A 47-year-old lottery winner worth £22million was today revealed to be in the midst of a divorce, with his childhood sweetheart ex-wife set to get half his fortune.

Karl Crompton, of Lancashire, who was once dubbed Britain's most eligible bachelor and the 'Rollover Romeo', took home his £11million winnings aged just 23 in 1996.

He married his childhood sweetheart Nicole Roach in 2006 and the couple, who did not sign a prenuptial agreement when they wed, have two children together.

The couple, who have sons Ethan, 16, and Jenson, 12, are now said to be separated with Ms Roach living in a different home and no longer wearing her wedding ring.

Mr Crompton had known Ms Roach since they were at school together in Blackpool, and she had a boyfriend when he won but they got together a year later.

Mr Crompton was living with his parents in a three-bedroom semi five miles from Blackpool when his numbers came up in May 1996.

In the year following his win, the former £100-a-week Comet trainee blew £3.5million of his jackpot on luxury cars including Porsches and Ferraris and fancy holidays.

But he cleverly invested his funds after settling down with nurse Ms Roach and now has a substantial portfolio - including a £2million home in Fylde, Lancashire.

Ms Roach was in a relationship with someone else when Mr Crompton got lucky with his lottery win in 1996 - but the pair got together 12 months later.

In 1999, he bought 11 acres in Elswick in rural Lancashire for £500,000 and demolished a former hospital on the site.

Mr Crompton then spent £1.5million building a 6,500 sq ft, five-bedroom house in traditional brick and stone, with a pool, security and entertainment systems.

He moved into the house with Ms Roach and their son Ethan in 2001, and also bought eight buy-to-let properties in the area.

Then in summer 2004, the couple spent £250,000 on a 16-year-old house in Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver, one hour from Whistler ski resort in Canada.

The three-bedroom contemporary property is set into a rock face with spectacular views – but the couple rented it out rather than using it as a holiday home.

Speaking in 2009, Mr Crompton told the Sunday Mirror: 'You could say I've been there, done that. Now I'm happy just to wear the T-shirt.'

'I've got a Golf and people keep asking ask me, 'Why haven't you got a Ferrari? But that's just not me any more. I'm married with two kids and I've got everything I want.

'Why would I want to go out and buy all that stuff again? Once I was sitting in a Bentley in a showroom when the salesman came over, looked me up and down and told me, 'that car is sold'. I went, 'Oh sorry', and got out.

'Then I said, 'I'm just waiting for the salesman to bring me the Ferrari that was here because I've just bought it.' You should have seen his face.'

Last week, Ms Roach was not wearing a ring when entering a Range Rover. She is also understood to now live 20 minutes away after moving out of the family home.

A source told The Sun: 'We've heard they are divorcing and she's expected to get half. We're all a bit worried about Karl. He seems heartbroken.'

Neither Mr Crompton nor Ms Roach wished to comment when approached.

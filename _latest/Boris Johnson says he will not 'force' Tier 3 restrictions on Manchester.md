Boris Johnson has signalled that he will not force Manchester to go into Tier 3 restrictions as he said he would “much rather not impose things” on the city.

A standoff between the Government and local leaders continued today, with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham leading calls for more financial support for high risk areas.

Government sources have suggested “doing nothing” is not an option, but Mr Johnson appeared to hesitate today when he said “local leaders” should show the way.

Mr Johnson said: “I am, I have to say, concerned about what's happening in Manchester where the levels of infection are rising steeply, the level of hospitalisation is rising steeply and we do need to see action.

"I'd much rather not impose things, I'd much rather that we were able to work out something together with local authorities, with the mayor in Manchester.

"But it is up to local leaders to show the kind of leadership that we have seen in Liverpool, in Lancashire and in London."

The Prime Minister will hold a press conference on Friday afternoon to update the country on the latest news on the coronavirus strategy.

Senior Government sources had suggested Greater Manchester would have to be put into the top tier “before the weekend” because of the high coronavirus infection rate and strain on the NHS.

<p>Ryan hasn&#8217;t finished his tattoo journey with Matt just yet, but with so many fans urging him to post a picture of the "finished product" we expect to see one soon.</p> <p>With a vibrant shark on his neck, and another graphic design on his temple it's possible that Matt will join everything up.</p> <p> <strong>Do you have a story to share?

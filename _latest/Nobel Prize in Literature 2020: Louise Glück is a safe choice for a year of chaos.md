Like 2011 Nobel laureate Tomas Transtromer, Glück writes poetry that aims for the timeless, rather than the topical. In this regard, she might seem a safe, even over-cautious choice. However, choosing a writer as self-contained as Glück could also be seen as a rejection of the headline-hungry approach taken by many other prizes, such as the Booker, where writers are often celebrated for their “relevance” and the vehemence with which they respond to issues of the day.

“What the Academy seems to have done is they’ve gone for a poet who is, in a sense, aesthetically, imaginatively, at odds with the age,” Schmidt argues. “And I think there’s this wonderful sense that she is not polemical, and maybe this is what’s being celebrated.

“She’s not a person trying to persuade us of anything, but helping us to explore the world we’re living in. She’s a clarifying poet. There doesn’t seem to be much political engagement in her poems. They’re really about the individual human being alive in the world, and in the language.”

One suspects that Glück would be happy if she had just one devoted reader, carefully poring over her books in solitude. For her admirers, reading a Glück poem can feel like being that reader, reading words intended for your eyes alone. She writes about love and isolation, about death and rebirth, in poems which often use a first-person speaker and simple, pared-back language to create a sense of disarming intimacy.

But intimacy is not the same as openness. “An intimacy/ had grown up between us/ like a forest around a castle,” Glück writes in a poem from her latest book, Faithful and Virtuous Night (2014), describing the “indifference” and “evasiveness” of a silent psychoanalyst.

Explaining the Nobel committee’s decision, its chair Anders Olsson made the curious move of telling the world how not to read Glück: “Even if her autobiographical background is significant in her works, she is not to be regarded as a confessional poet.”

<h4>What happened overnight&#160;</h4>
<p>Shares advanced in Asia on Monday after China reported its economy grew at a 4.9pc&#160;annual pace in the last quarter, with consumer spending and industrial production rising to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Japan's Nikkei 225 led the gains, adding more than 1pc&#160;by midday.</p>
<p>China was the first country to suffer coronavirus outbreaks and the first to emerge from the pandemic and begin reopening its economy. After contracting 6.8pc&#160;in the first quarter of this year the economy grew 3.2pc&#160;in the April-June quarter.</p>
<p>The 2.7pc&#160;quarterly expansion was weaker than expected. Still, the recovery of Asia's largest economy is good news for other countries that rely heavily on trade with China, including Japan. It reported Monday that its exports fell at a slower pace in September from a year earlier, partly thanks to higher demand from China.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 index added 1.1pc&#160;to 23,672.60 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.8pc&#160;to 24,591.92. In South Korea, the Kospi jumped 0.9pc&#160;to 2,362.49 while the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Australia surged 1pc&#160;to 6,237.60.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Composite index logged a more modest gain, picking up 0.3pc&#160;to 3,346.61 as the relatively strong economic data doused the chances for major stimulus measures that might help boost markets.</p>

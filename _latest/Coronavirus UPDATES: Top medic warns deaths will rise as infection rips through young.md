Hospital deaths from coronavirus will rise in the coming weeks as infections continue to rise, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England has said.

At a briefing this morning Jonathan Van-Tam explained that high rates of infection among young adults was now spreading into older generations, which was leading to higher hospital admission rates.

“There is the spread from those younger age groups into the 60 plus age group in the North West and the North East, and there are rates of change in the same places but also extending a little further south,” he said.

“And this is again of significant concern... because of course the elderly suffer a much worse course with Covid-19, they are admitted to hospital for longer periods, and they are more difficult to save.”

Their briefing come after it was reported that the Army will be drafted to Liverpool to help the city in its coronavirus efforts.

At 3.30pm today Boris Johnson will address MPs in the House of Commons, before delivering an televised update to the people.

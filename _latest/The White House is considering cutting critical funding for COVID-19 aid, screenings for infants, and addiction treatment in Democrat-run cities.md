<p>A senior administration official told Politico that all the programs would be evaluated on a "case by case" basis. The Office of Management and Budget didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.</p><p>Trump has focused heavily on a "law and order" message in the months leading up to the election, attempting to blame Democrats for a spike in gun violence in some cities during the pandemic and paint mostly peaceful protests as riots.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-reviewing-funding-state-local-government-recipients-permitting-anarchy-violence-destruction-american-cities/">a September 2 memo,</a> Trump directed Attorney General Bill Barr and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought to reduce federal funding to cities that he claimed "allow crime and lawlessness to multiply" and "disempower" law enforcement.&#160;</p><p>"My Administration will do everything in its power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking Federal dollars while they let anarchists harm people, burn buildings, and ruin lives and businesses," Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1301315810485579776">tweeted</a> on September 2.

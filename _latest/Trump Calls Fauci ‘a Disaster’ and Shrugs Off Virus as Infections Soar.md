  Trump Calls Fauci ‘a Disaster’ and Shrugs Off Virus as Infections Soar 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON — President Trump attacked Dr. Anthony S. Fauci as “a disaster” on Monday and said, despite signs that the nation was headed toward another coronavirus peak, that people were “tired” of hearing about the virus from “these idiots” in the government.The broadside, during a conference call with campaign staff just two weeks before Election Day, was hardly the closing message Trump advisers were looking for.It threatened to focus the electorate squarely on the president’s coronavirus response and pitted him against Dr. Fauci, who as the nation’s top infectious disease expert is a career government scientist the public likes and trusts far more than Mr. Trump.“People are tired of Covid,” Mr. Trump complained on the call, which several reporters were invited into.Just leave us alone.’ They’re tired of it.”

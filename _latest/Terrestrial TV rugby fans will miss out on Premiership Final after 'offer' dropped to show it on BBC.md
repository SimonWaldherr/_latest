The BBC believed they were "all systems go" to broadcast this year's Gallagher Premiership final to a terrestrial audience before talks fell through, Telegraph Sport understands.

Discussions between Premiership Rugby and the BBC had been ongoing since September, with the booking process underway for studio space, as well as presenters and pundits, until the plans were cancelled.

BT Sport hold primary rights to broadcast the Gallagher Premiership, with selected matches shown on Channel 5 throughout the season along with a weekly highlights programme.

Exeter Chiefs will face Wasps in the Premiership final at Twickenham on October 24 in front of an empty stadium, with the game set to kick off at 6pm.

A BBC source said: “Premiership Rugby reached out to the upper echelons of BBC Sport and talks took place over kick-off times and various airtime requirements. Quite a lot of work had gone in to secure studio space, to book talent, but also sort various production logistics that are even more complicated in the current climate. As far as the BBC were concerned it was all systems go."

Premiership Rugby in response stated that talks between themselves and the BBC had only been "exploratory conversations". BT Sport could not be reached for comment.

Showing the final on the BBC would have provided the sport with invaluable exposure during a time when supporters have been unable to attend matches since March due to Covid-19. Sports usually broadcast exclusively on paid television have been shown terrestrially throughout the pandemic, with selected Premier League matches and England Cricket's one-day internationals and T20 matches shown on the BBC, to widespread praise from supporters.

The BBC currently share broadcasting rights for the Six Nations with ITV, while also showing highlights packages of England's autumn international matches. However the upcoming Autumn Nations Cup, which has replaced the usual Test calendar in November, will be almost exclusively broadcast on Amazon Prime Video, showing 14 of the 16 matches.

The remaining two matches, Ireland's home fixtures against Wales and Georgia, will be broadcast by Channel 4.

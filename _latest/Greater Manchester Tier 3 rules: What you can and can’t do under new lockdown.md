 <p>     </p> <p>The Prime Minister overruled local leaders and announced he was moving the area into Tier 3 at a Downing Street press conference.</p> <p>He said: "I know that these restrictions are tough, both on businesses and individuals - and believe me no one wants to be putting these things into effect.</p> <p>"But that is why we are putting in place a comprehensive package of support."</p> <p>Here's how life will change in Greater Manchester.</p> <h3>Households are banned from mixing</h3> <p>Under the new rules, you cannot mix with people from other households indoors.</p> <p>This applies to visiting friends or family at home, as well as public indoor settings such as pubs, restaurants and ticketed venues.</p> <p>Tradespeople such as electricians, plumbers and plasterers are the only people allowed to visit other people's homes to carry out work.</p> <p>Outdoor meet-ups between households are also banned, including in beer gardens and private gardens.</p> <p>You can still meet friends and family on a beach, in a forest or in a public park - but you must obey the rule of six limits.</p> <h3>Pubs and bars must close - unless they serve food</h3> <p>From Friday, pubs and bars must shut the doors completely unless they serve substantial meals.</p> <p>Punters can buy alcohol if they consume it with a lunchtime meal or dinner. </p> <p>Bar snacks do not count, unfortunately.</p>

 <h3>Casinos, bingo halls, betting shops and soft play areas have to shut</h3> <p>Indoor leisure facilities such as casinos and bingo halls will all be shuttered under Tier 3 rules. </p> <p>In a disappointing move for parents, soft play areas must also close.</p> <p>It follows a similar list of closures in Lancashire, which went into Tier 3 on Saturday.</p> <h3>But gyms can stay open</h3> <p>This has been a sore point for council leaders in Merseyside - another Tier 3 areas - where gyms have been forced to close. </p> <p>It is unclear why the gym was declared too risky in Liverpool City Region but not down the road in Lancashire, where work-out spaces were allowed to remain open.</p> <p>Local leaders erupted in fury when the inconsistencies in the rules emerged last week.</p>

 <h3>What financial support is Greater Manchester getting?</h3> <p>The size of the financial bailout is the centre of the row between local leaders and Westminster.</p> <p>Mr Burnham said civic leaders had reduced their original demand of &#163;90million for stricken businesses and for workers to top up furlough payments.</p> <p>It was then reduced again to &#163;75million, then &#163;65million but the Government refused and walked away, Mr Burnham said.</p> <p>It it thought the Government wanted to offer &#163;60million - meaning the talks were trashed over &#163;5million difference.</p> <p>By&#160;contrast, the Government has already spent more than &#163;200bn on the&#160;<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a>&#160;crisis.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the &#163;60million demand remains on the table.</p> <h3> <strong>The full rules for Tier 3 - 'very high'</strong> </h3> <p><strong>Social contact:&#160;</strong> You cannot meet anyone outside your household or support bubble indoors. Strict rules also ban any meet-ups in private gardens, beer gardens, hospitality or ticketed venues. You will only be able to see people not in your household or bubble is in a public open space, such as a park, forest, beach - and in groups of no more than six. </p> <p><strong>Pubs and restaurants:&#160;</strong> All bars must close unless they serve food. You can only buy alcohol if you are also consuming a "substantial meal" - not a bar snack. </p> <p><strong>Schools, universities and childcare:&#160;</strong> These remain open in all circumstances, but universities can do more online learning. </p> <p><strong>Travel and transport:&#160;</strong> You should limit any journeys made outside your local area - except for work and school run journeys. This is guidance, rather than the law. People are advised against overnight stays outside the area or having visitors to stay from elsewhere.</p>

 <p><strong>Work: </strong>The advice is to work from home if you can. </p> <p><strong>Weddings and funerals:&#160;</strong> 15 guests can attend marriage ceremonies but receptions are banned. Funerals can have up to 30 mourners, with only 15 people allowed at the wake. </p> <p><strong>Shops:</strong> &#160;All retail - including non-essential shops - can stay open. </p> <p><strong>Gyms, hairdressers, public facilities:&#160;</strong> Local areas can negotiate whether to close facilities including casinos and gyms, such as they have in the Liverpool City Region. </p> <p><strong>Sports:&#160;</strong> Organised indoor sport and exercise classes can continue to take place, provided rule of six is observed </p> <p><strong>Length of time:&#160;</strong> Regulations will be reviewed every 28 days and expire after 6 months. </p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<h3>Which areas are already in Tier 3?</h3> <p>The Liverpool City Region was the first area to be placed into the highest level of restrictions on Wednesday, 13 October.</p> <p>The whole of Lancashire, including Blackpool, was also put into this category on Saturday, 17 October. </p> <h3>Which areas could move into Tier 3?</h3> <p>Discussions are ongoing with civic leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and North East, the Prime Minister said.</p> <p>Seven council areas in the North East were given a stay of execution last week, after leaders successfully argued to stay in Tier 2 for another week to see if the infection rate could be reduced.</p></div>

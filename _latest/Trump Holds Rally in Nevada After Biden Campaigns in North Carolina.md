According to a recent <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/us/politics/ohio-nevada-poll-trump-biden.html" title="">Times/Siena College poll</a>, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump 48 percent to 42 percent, with 6 percent of the state&#8217;s voters saying they remain undecided.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But even if Mr. Trump is behind in the polls, he did get encouragement, and a blessing, from some evangelical leaders: Early Sunday, he attended services at the International Church of Las Vegas, where a church leader said that she had a prophecy that God would give the president &#8220;a second wind&#8221; to carry him through the campaign, and &#8220;that he will be the president again.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Mr. Trump placed a handful of $20 bills into the offering bucket at the International Church of Las Vegas.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Doug Mills/The New York Times</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump then attended a fund-raiser in Newport Beach, Calif., on Sunday afternoon, and returned to Nevada for a rally at an airport in Carson City.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a meandering speech that lasted about 90 minutes, Mr. Trump spent much of the time attacking Mr. Biden and other Democrats.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The &#8220;Biden family is a criminal enterprise,&#8221; Mr. Trump said, as the crowd responded with chants of &#8220;Lock him up.&#8221; </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump, who tested positive for the coronavirus less than three weeks ago, said the country was &#8220;rounding the turn&#8221; on the pandemic, which has now left <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">more than 219,000 Americans dead</a>. </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Normal life, that&#8217;s all we want, we want normal life,&#8221; he told the cheering crowd. &#8220;We want to be where we were seven months ago.&#8221; </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Sunday&#8217;s events marked the president&#8217;s second swing through Nevada in the last two months &#8212; in September he hosted two rallies, including one indoors. The business that hosted the indoor rally in Henderson, a Las Vegas suburb, was later fined because thousands of people were present, despite state health regulations limiting gatherings to 50 people.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Current state guidelines say gatherings should be limited to 250 people. Mr. Trump has described his campaign events as &#8220;protests,&#8221; which he says should exempt them from limits on large gatherings.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Over the past decade, Democrats in Nevada have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/politics/nevada-2020-biden-trump.html" title="">notched one hard-fought victory after another</a>. In 2010, Senator Harry Reid won his hotly contested re-election campaign, even as the party lost other battles all over the country. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the state, though with a smaller margin of victory than Democrats garnered in the previous two presidential contests. And in 2018, the Democrats managed to capture the governor&#8217;s office and the state Senate.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The state has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, which brought tourism to a halt and left 90 percent of members of the powerful Culinary Union, which represents tens of thousands of workers in Las Vegas and Reno, unemployed. The union has long been credited with helping Democrats win in the state.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jennifer-medina" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="biden-rallies-voters-in-north-carolina-a-critical-state-for-trump-to-keep-in-his-column"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#biden-rallies-voters-in-north-carolina-a-critical-state-for-trump-to-keep-in-his-column">Biden rallies voters in North Carolina, a critical state for Trump to keep in his column.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Joseph R.

His campaign has stressed the importance of following health precautions, and the drive-in events reflect a starkly different approach to campaigning during a pandemic compared with the large rallies that President Trump is holding.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Early in-person voting <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/elections/in-north-carolina-as-in-other-states-early-in-person-voting-started-strong.html" title="">is underway in North Carolina</a>, which Democrats have not won in a presidential election since Barack Obama narrowly carried the state in 2008. At the rally, Mr. Biden urged people not to wait to vote.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Go vote today, and don&#8217;t just vote for me and Senator Harris,&#8221; he said, listing a number of other races in the state, including contests for governor and senator.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Polls in North Carolina show a close race between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump. A recent <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/us/politics/north-carolina-trump-polls.html" title="">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> found Mr. Biden with the support of 46 percent of likely voters, compared with 42 percent for Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For the president, keeping the state in his column is critically important.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Without North Carolina, it&#8217;s very hard to imagine Donald Trump winning,&#8221; Jennifer O&#8217;Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden&#8217;s campaign manager, said during a virtual event with supporters on Friday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">North Carolina is also a crucial state in the fight for control of the Senate, where Republicans are hoping to hold on to their majority. Senator Thom Tillis is trying to keep his seat in a close and expensive race against Cal Cunningham, his Democratic challenger.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Cunningham has been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/us/politics/coronavirus-thom-tillis-cal-cunningham-north-carolina.html" title="">embroiled in a scandal</a> over exchanging romantic text messages with a woman who is not his wife, and he did not have a speaking slot at Mr. Biden&#8217;s rally.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Afterward, Mr. Biden participated in a virtual event with African-American faith leaders, during which he asked for their prayers. &#8220;Pray I have the capacity to step up and do this job, because four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of this country for several generations,&#8221; he said. </p><p class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</p><p class="css-1ceswkc e1drnplw1"></p><p class="css-mln36k" id="modal-title">transcript</p><p class="css-1701swk">bars</p><p class="css-1t7yl1y">0:00 / 1:17</p><p class="css-og85jy">- 0:00</p><p class="css-1qi8px4">transcript</p><h2 class="css-9wqu2x">&#8216;We Can&#8217;t Let Up,&#8217; Biden Says to North Carolina Voters</h2><h4 class="css-qsd3hm">Joseph R.

Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan on Sunday condemned President Trump after his supporters at a Saturday rally in the state broke out in a chant to &#8220;lock her up,&#8221; just a week after she was the target of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-militia.html" title="">a kidnapping plot</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Speaking to NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press,&#8221; Ms. Whitmer said, &#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly disturbing that the president of the United States, 10 days after a plot to kidnap, put me on trial and execute me &#8212; 10 days after that was uncovered &#8212; the president is at it again and inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Whitmer has been the target of conservative criticism for her strict policies in the spring to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and Michigan&#8217;s Supreme Court recently ruled that her use of executive orders to extend the state&#8217;s emergency declaration order was unconstitutional. Since a peak in the spring, Michigan had successfully kept coronavirus cases from climbing until the last few weeks, which have seen a sharp rise.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get distracted by attacks from the White House or a Supreme Court here in the state that is undermining my work,&#8221; Ms. Whitmer said on Sunday. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to keep going forward and doing everything I can to protect my people.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">At the Saturday rally, held at the Muskegon airport, Mr. Trump responded to the &#8220;lock her up&#8221; chants by saying, &#8220;Lock them all up.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Sunday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi also condemned the president over the episode, while Trump campaign surrogates played down his remarks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi, appearing on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week,&#8221; said Mr. Trump&#8217;s rhetoric was &#8220;irresponsible,&#8221; particularly targeting a female governor.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The president has to realize that the words of the president of the United States weigh a ton,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi said. &#8220;And in our political dialogue, to inject fear tactics into it, especially a woman governor and her family, is so irresponsible.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Jason Miller, a senior adviser for the Trump campaign, said on &#8220;Fox News Sunday&#8221; that Mr. Trump does not regret his remarks made during the rally.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I think the fact of the matter is that many residents of Michigan are pretty frustrated with the governor,&#8221; Mr. Miller said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad that President Trump&#8217;s D.O.J. was able to get these psychopaths and put them away,&#8221; he added of the 13 men arrested in connection with the domestic terrorism plot.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On CNN&#8217;s &#8220;State of the Union,&#8221; Lara Trump, a senior adviser for the campaign and the wife of Mr. Trump&#8217;s son Eric, said the president &#8220;wasn&#8217;t doing anything, I don&#8217;t think, to provoke people to threaten this woman at all.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;He was having fun at a Trump rally,&#8221; she said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Chris Cameron</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-kaplan" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Thomas Kaplan</a> and </p><p class="css-608m5d" id="senator-chris-coons-says-he-is-open-to-steps-to-rebalance-the-supreme-court"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#senator-chris-coons-says-he-is-open-to-steps-to-rebalance-the-supreme-court">Senator Chris Coons says he is open to steps to &#8216;rebalance&#8217; the Supreme Court.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, at a confirmation hearing for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump&#8217;s Supreme Court nominee." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/18/us/politics/18election-brieifng-coons/merlin_178532820_e85ec4ba-40ce-4de6-a37e-f7dc8c42f88b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, at a confirmation hearing for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump&#8217;s Supreme Court nominee.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Hilary Swift for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said on Sunday he is open to expanding the number of justices on the Supreme Court should Senate Republicans continue to rush forward to confirm President Trump&#8217;s nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Coons, a key ally of the Democratic nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., called Judge Barrett &#8220;extreme&#8221; and &#8220;unqualified&#8221; during an interview on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;State of the Union.&#8221; Mr. Coons added he was &#8220;not a fan&#8221; of expanding the number of justices on the court, but said he would consider it if necessary.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If we happen to be in the fact pattern where we have a President Biden, we&#8217;ll have to look at what the right steps are to rebalance our federal judiciary,&#8221; Mr. Coons said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Coons&#8217;s refusal to rule out expanding the court carries particular weight because he is one of the more bipartisan Senate Democrats, and because he is close to Mr. Biden and has his ear.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republicans, is expected on Thursday to vote in favor of Judge Barrett, a conservative Catholic who personally opposes abortion rights. Mr. Coons also defended Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, from calls that she be replaced after she praised and hugged Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the committee, at the end of last week&#8217;s hearings on Judge Barrett&#8217;s nomination.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Senator Feinstein was clear in her opposition to Judge Barrett. She has a long record of fighting for reproductive rights, for gender equity,&#8221; Mr. Coons said. &#8220;She carried the torch well for those of us on the Democratic side who were fighting this nomination. I don&#8217;t think we should put too much weight on just a few sentences at the end of four long days where she was being gracious to the chairman.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He said Ms. Feinstein and other Democrats on the committee remain &#8220;angry&#8221; at Mr. Graham for &#8220;racing through&#8221; Judge Barrett&#8217;s nomination.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="biden-is-vastly-outspending-trump-in-tv-advertising-maintaining-a-nearly-2-to-1-advantage-on-the-airwaves"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#biden-is-vastly-outspending-trump-in-tv-advertising-maintaining-a-nearly-2-to-1-advantage-on-the-airwaves">Biden is vastly outspending Trump in TV advertising, maintaining a nearly 2-to-1 advantage on the airwaves.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/17/us/18elections-briefing-ad-spending/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending-promo-1602961352488-articleLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump is being vastly outspent by Joseph R. Biden Jr. in television advertising in the general election battleground states and elsewhere, with the former vice president focusing overwhelmingly on the coronavirus as millions of Americans across the country begin casting early votes.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has maintained a nearly 2-to-1 advantage on the airwaves for months. His dominance is most pronounced in three critical swing states &#8212; Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin &#8212; where he spent about $53 million to Mr. Trump&#8217;s $17 million over the past month, largely on ads assailing the president&#8217;s handling of the virus as well as the economy and taxes, according to data from Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Pennsylvania alone, Mr. Biden ran 38 different ads during a single week this month, a sign of how comprehensive his effort there has been.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president&#8217;s ad strategy, in turn, reflects the challenges facing both his campaign finances and his Electoral College map. He has recently scaled back advertising in battleground states like Ohio and Iowa and, until this past week, slashed ads in Michigan and Wisconsin, despite being <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president" title="">behind in polls</a>. And Mr. Trump is having to divert resources to hold onto Republican-leaning states like Arizona and Georgia.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump spent less on ads in 2016, too, but he went on to narrowly capture critical states anyway and prevail over Hillary Clinton. Back then he relied heavily on huge rallies and live cable news coverage to get his message out, and he got extensive airtime for his attacks on Mrs. Clinton. This time around, his rallies have been fewer and smaller because of the pandemic and his own virus infection; the events have gotten less cable coverage; and he has had a hard time making attacks stick on Mr. Biden.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In many ways, the advertising picture reveals how the pandemic has upended the 2020 race. With in-person campaigning sharply limited, the traditional advantages built by a ground game in battleground states have largely been replaced by the air cover provided by advertising. More than $1.5 billion has been spent on the presidential race alone; by contrast, $496 million was spent on ads in just the presidential race by this point in the 2016 race.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nick-corasaniti" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Nick Corasaniti</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/weiyi-cai" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Weiyi Cai</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/denise-lu" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="in-public-team-trump-projects-confidence-in-private-its-a-different-story"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#in-public-team-trump-projects-confidence-in-private-its-a-different-story">In public, Team Trump projects confidence.

When they meet with Republican donors and state party leaders, presidential aides insist they are fully capable of achieving a close victory over Joseph R.

Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, is drawing furious blame from the president and some political advisers for his handling of Mr. Trump&#8217;s recent hospitalization.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, has maintained to senior Republicans that the president has a path forward in the race but at times has conceded it is narrow.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Some midlevel aides on the Trump campaign have even begun inquiring about employment on Capitol Hill after the election, apparently under the assumption that there will not be a second Trump administration for them to serve in.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Less than three weeks before Election Day, there is now an extraordinary gulf separating Mr. Trump&#8217;s experience of the campaign from the more sobering political assessments of a number of party officials and operatives, according to interviews with nearly a dozen Republican strategists, White House allies and elected officials. Among some of Mr. Trump&#8217;s lieutenants, there is an attitude of grit mixed with resignation: a sense that the best they can do for the final stretch is to keep the president occupied, happy and off Twitter as much as possible, rather than producing a major shift in strategy.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Often, their biggest obstacle is Mr. Trump himself.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Instead of delivering a focused closing message aimed at changing people&#8217;s perceptions about his handling of the coronavirus, or making a case for why he can revive the economy better than Mr. Biden can, Mr. Trump is spending the remaining days on a familiar mix of personal grievances, attacks on his opponents and obfuscations.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The president appears to have doubled down on a base election strategy,&#8221; said Ken Spain, a Republican strategist, &#8220;while Republicans down ballot must figure out a way to appeal to independent voters in states like North Carolina and Maine and Michigan.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Maggie Haberman</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alexander-burns" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="these-voters-didnt-support-clinton-in-2016-this-year-they-plan-to-vote-for-biden"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#these-voters-didnt-support-clinton-in-2016-this-year-they-plan-to-vote-for-biden">These voters didn&#8217;t support Clinton in 2016.

Yet for many Democrats and independents who sat out 2016, voted for third-party candidates or backed Mr. Trump, it is a rationale for their vote that comes up repeatedly: Mr. Biden is more acceptable to them than Mrs. Clinton was, in ways large and small, personal and political, sexist and not, and those differences help them feel more comfortable voting for the Democratic nominee this time around.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden also benefits, of course, from the intense desire among Democrats to get President Trump out of office. And a majority of voters give the president low marks for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the dominant issue of the race. But a key distinction between 2020 and 2016 is that, four years ago, the race came down to two of the most disliked and polarizing candidates in American history, and one of them also faced obstacles that came with being a barrier-breaking woman.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden now leads Mr. Trump in many public polls by bigger margins than Mrs. Clinton had in 2016. In private polling and focus groups, voters express more positive views of Mr. Biden than of Mrs. Clinton, according to strategists affiliated with both Democrats&#8217; campaigns.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Since 2019, Mr. Biden has held an advantage of four to eight points over Mrs. Clinton in key swing districts, according to an analysis by John Hagner, a partner at Clarity Campaign Labs, a Democratic data analytics firm.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Polling shows Mr. Biden scoring higher than Mrs. Clinton among a wide range of demographic groups &#8212; most notably older voters, white voters and suburbanites. But his advantage is stark among those who sat out the 2016 election or backed third-party candidates.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump, 49 percent to 19 percent, among likely voters who backed third-party candidates in 2016, according to recent polling of battleground states by The New York Times and Siena College.

Embedded in Mr. Biden&#8217;s shorthand is that he can win back the paradigmatic Scranton voter: white, working class, disaffected by Democrats.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Scranton is no longer the dying coal town of Mr. Biden&#8217;s youth. It is both more racially diverse and prosperous. In more than two dozen interviews the week of Mr. Biden&#8217;s visit, few voters were particularly enthusiastic about his candidacy, despite his personal roots, but about half said they probably would vote for him anyway. Voters who abandoned the Democratic Party in 2016 said they planned to vote for Mr. Trump again this year. Some people said they were so fed up with politics that they were not going to vote at all. Others expressed annoyance at what they said was Mr. Biden&#8217;s habit of making Scranton into a kind of blue-collar cartoon.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">At the town-hall-style event, held six miles from downtown in a stadium parking lot, Mr. Biden, in describing the hometown he knew, said that not many people in Scranton owned stock.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Frankly, it was insulting,&#8221; said Frances Keating, 74, a retired accountant who has lived in Scranton most of her life. &#8220;He&#8217;s using Scranton as a prop.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, she said she planned to vote for Mr. Biden because &#8220;Trump is a monster.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Scranton has become a symbol for Democrats&#8217; lost dreams in 2016, when working-class voters abandoned the party in droves. The city itself is blue. But the surrounding county, Lackawanna, and a neighboring one, Luzerne, had the second- and third-largest swings toward Mr. Trump of any county with more than 100,000 voters in the United States. The surge was enough to cover his 44,000-vote victory in Pennsylvania.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump is trailing in the state by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/flpa-0930-crosstabs/16c21b7ab34ed4d1/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven percentage points</a>, but the enthusiasm he enjoys among many ancestral Democrats in Scranton highlights the challenges Mr. Biden still faces in a state regarded by both parties as a must-win next month.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sabrina-tavernise" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="senator-john-cornyn-says-getting-trump-to-mend-his-ways-is-like-someone-trying-to-change-their-spouse"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#senator-john-cornyn-says-getting-trump-to-mend-his-ways-is-like-someone-trying-to-change-their-spouse">Senator John Cornyn says getting Trump to mend his ways is like someone trying to &#8216;change their spouse.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Image</p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, at the confirmation hearing for Judge Amy Coney Barrett.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p>Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times</p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With the G.O.P. majority in the Senate in peril and Democrats closing the gap in his home state, Senator John Cornyn of Texas acknowledged that Republican lawmakers like himself who are on the ballot this year are wedded to President Trump: for better or worse.  </p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In an interview on Friday with the editorial board of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/article246503045.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>, Mr. Cornyn compared his relationship with Mr. Trump to marriage and said that getting the president to mend his ways was futile.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He described the dynamic as &#8220;maybe like a lot of women who get married and think they&#8217;re going to change their spouse, and that doesn&#8217;t usually work out very well.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Cornyn said that he has avoided public spats with Mr. Trump, in contrast with some of his Republican colleagues who have crossed the president.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I think what we found is that we&#8217;re not going to change President Trump,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He is who he is.

Our video shows how states&#8217; responses to Russian hacking and the coronavirus crisis have helped make the election more secure than ever.</h4><dl class="css-p98d0w"><dt class="css-xx7kwh"></dt><dd class="css-12tddc8"><p class="css-8hvvyd">Voting machines. Our democracy depends on them to accurately record each and every ballot. You go to the polls, you cast your vote, your voice is heard. Right? Not so fast. &#8220;Russian attacks.&#8221; &#8220;Russian hackers.&#8221; &#8220;Russian hackers tried to break into U.S. election systems.&#8221; Because in 2016 &#8212; &#8220;The Russians managed to get us paranoid about the security of our own election systems.&#8221; But this year, experts are more confident that &#8212; &#8220;I think it is safe to say this is the most secure election we&#8217;ve ever held in the United States.&#8221; In 2016, Russians infiltrated our voting systems in every single state. &#8220;This was one of the most successful intelligence operations in modern history.&#8221; Now, there&#8217;s no evidence Russians altered votes, but &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s as if a cat burglar got into your house, cased the joint, but didn&#8217;t take anything.&#8221; And it raised the question &#8212; &#8220;Could the Russians actually affect the vote?&#8221; But because of some of the machines we were using, we didn&#8217;t know for sure. So in 2020, if there&#8217;s another cyberattack, Americans want to know that their vote was counted as they cast it. Like, say, with a &#8212; &#8220;Voter-verified paper trail.&#8221; Yes, like that. A paper trail. Turns out a few people tried to make this happen years ago, but &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s a rough world out there in the elections voting system business.&#8221; To see why it took Russia&#8217;s hacking to improve our voting technology, we go to Texas. The Constitution gives states power to run their own elections, and most states give counties the power to choose their own voting machines. And nowhere is this more apparent than in &#8212; &#8220;Texas.&#8221; &#8220;Texas.&#8221; &#8220;Texas &#8212;&#8221; [mooing] &#8220;&#8212; is a microcosm of all the different voting technologies used everywhere in the U.S. Every different Texas county, different voting system, different procedures.&#8221; Dan Wallach is a computer scientist at Rice University in Houston, and he had actually been warning about the vulnerabilities of our voting system long before 2016. &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about evil software in the machines flipping your vote in a way that you, the voter, can&#8217;t tell that the machine was evil.&#8221; He was most concerned about direct recording electronic voting machines, or DREs. &#8220;The only record of your vote is inside the memory of that machine. And that means that if something tampers with that electronic memory, you have no way to go back.&#8221; And yet in the last presidential election, 28 percent of registered voters used these machines. So how did some Americans get stuck with these vulnerable voting machines? Well, to find out, we need to go all the way back to 2000. The aught. Florida. It was Al Gore versus George Bush for president. &#8220;Oh my goodness. 2000. That was the election that we all thought would never end. &#8220;The presidential race is crackling like a hickory fire here. Couldn&#8217;t be much closer.&#8221; A contested vote, a recount and all of it came down to the chads. Those pesky fragments of paper leftover when a hole is punched in a card. Not all those chads were entirely punched through, though. &#8220;There was a hanging chad.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s slightly detached.&#8221; &#8220;Pregnant chad.&#8221; &#8220;Dimpled chad.&#8221; &#8220;Opening and closing chad.&#8221; During the recount, poll workers were left to determine voter intent, and all eyes were on the chads. &#8220;By that time, we all knew what a bad system punch-card voting was.&#8221; &#8220;In the wake of the hanging chad issues, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002. The Help America Vote Act allocated billions of dollars to help states replace antiquated voting machines.&#8221; And the states went shopping. Some bought hand-marked paper ballots and optical scanners. And others bought the machines that had worried Dan the most. The very modern, paperless DREs. &#8220;If it were up to me today, and if I were selling voting technology, I would not sell a paperless DRE system in good conscience. I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do.&#8221; This is Eddie Perez. He used to sell these machines, but left the industry to advocate for more secure voting systems with a paper trail. &#8220;I would characterize the level of federal regulation for voting technology as relatively thin. There are a lot of products that are actually more highly regulated than voting technology. Even things as mundane as ballpoint pens. Parts fail, systems get old, screens stop performing the way they are supposed to. So a voter might touch one portion of the screen to mark one candidate and the system interprets it as a choice for someone else.&#8221; &#8220;It is not letting me vote for who I want to vote for.&#8221; &#8220;There is plenty of voting equipment that is still out there whose design dates, probably, all the way back to 20 years ago.&#8221; But with most of their federal money spent, many Texas counties were stuck. &#8220;We kept our electronic voting system for 18 years.&#8221; As Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir is responsible for picking the machines for voters in Austin. &#8220;The thing that was most important to our voters was to have a paper trail. But none of the voting system manufacturers would build a system with a paper trail. And it was frustrating.&#8221; And so she decided to build one herself. &#8220;I was watching a video of a professor out of Rice University rake me over the coals.&#8221; &#8220;Such blatant security flaws. I mean, just really bad engineering.&#8221; &#8220;Instead of just getting mad, I went to that person.&#8221; &#8220;My phone rings and it&#8217;s Dana, and she says, &#8216;I want your help.&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;And I said to him, &#8216;Let&#8217;s you and I design a voting system together.&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m like, seriously? All right. Can I invite my friends? We hacked up an inkjet printer and a bunch of other cheap hardware mashed into a custom steel box that we built, and we came up with a really great design.&#8221; They called it S.T.A.R. Vote. &#8220;Computer scientists love to make acronyms out of words. First we come up with the acronym, then we try to find the words that fit.&#8221; &#8220;Secure.&#8221; &#8220;Transparent.&#8221; &#8220;Auditable.&#8221; &#8220;Reliable.&#8221; &#8220;A combination of both electronic and paper voting paper voting methods.&#8221; &#8220;S.T.A.R. Vote.&#8221; A new electronic voting machine with paper backup ballots that help with verification and audit. An open-source system which makes it more secure and cheaper for taxpayers. The end product, a newer, safer voting machine. &#8220;What we were actually doing was a start-up business. And I don&#8217;t think we really realized that at the outset.&#8221; Designing a machine is one thing. Finding someone to manufacture it is another. &#8220;The voting system industry is a couple hundred million dollars a year. That&#8217;s a teeny tiny market.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to get in the marketplace, and they don&#8217;t welcome anybody else coming in.&#8221; In a small market, there&#8217;s not much room for competition. Just three companies dominate the voting machine industry. &#8220;Those three major vendors are the ones that have carved out their space and made their commitment to it. And so they actually wield a lot of power in that industry.&#8221; &#8220;That market doesn&#8217;t leave a whole lot of room for companies to do innovative design and development.&#8221; &#8220;Voting technology is simply very, very slow to change.&#8221; &#8220;Current electronic voting machines have little or no security built in. Please help me and other elections administrators who want to do a better job. What we are designing is an electronic voting system. We&#8217;re ready to start building S.T.A.R. Vote.&#8221; In 2016, Dana DeBeauvoir had reached the final stages of the S.T.A.R. Vote design when reports that &#8230; &#8220;The intelligence services of a foreign power intervened on a scale never seen before.&#8221; &#8230; shook America&#8217;s confidence in its voting system. It seemed like the perfect moment for new players like S.T.A.R. Vote, who&#8217;d spent years thinking about how to get voters to trust their election results. &#8220;Since we had done all the design work for them, we thought one of the regular manufacturers would pick this up. Travis County put it out to bid. Most of the big manufacturers submitted bids. However, they submitted bids that were more along the lines of, buy what we already have.&#8221; She says the vendors rejected a key security component of S.T.A.R. Vote. &#8220;Open-source software.&#8221; Good for transparency, but having free source code means companies can&#8217;t charge as much. &#8220;Open-source systems &#8212; at least the way this one was designed, and in most cases &#8212; are low-revenue software projects.&#8221; They all passed. With the 2020 election around the corner, Dana still had all those aging DREs, so she was &#8212; &#8220;Running out of time. At that point, we realized that we had reached the end of our possibilities with S.T.A.R. Vote. It was probably the lowest time in my entire career. We had the secret recipe for pulling everybody together, and we still hadn&#8217;t made it happen.&#8221; But bigger changes were happening nationally. After 2016, voting systems were declared part of the country&#8217;s critical infrastructure &#8212; like dams and power plants. This meant new federal scrutiny of how Americans cast their vote for the first time since 2000. &#8220;And the voting machine manufacturers began to get the message.&#8221; &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;They began to move towards systems that had paper backup because they recognized that the political pressure was tremendous.&#8221; In 2018, Congress gave the states more money to fortify their systems and required a paper trail for all newly purchased voting machines. &#8220;Six months after we got the bad news that no one was going to build S.T.A.R. Vote for us, we got a dramatic turnaround in the industry for voting systems. They had in fact built a new voting system with electronic support and a paper trail. My thrill was a little bit tempered by the frustration of knowing that they could have done it years before.&#8221; And so Travis County joins battleground states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, and went shopping. Again. &#8220;A lot of money.&#8221; And paper is the reason experts are saying 2020 may be the most secure election we&#8217;ve ever held. It&#8217;s not just about the voting machines. A greater number of e-poll books &#8212; which are used to check-in voters on Election Day &#8212; will also have a paper backup system. &#8220;And that&#8217;s why the Department of Homeland Security has spent a year trying to get cities and towns across America to print out those e-poll books to make sure that they had multiple backups of their registration systems.&#8221; A process moved further along by the pandemic. &#8220;You know in an odd way, the coronavirus crisis has helped us some in our election crises.&#8221; It&#8217;s pushed many states to shift to mail-in voting, which offers an automatic paper backup. In 2020, because of states buying new voting systems and the increase in vote-by-mail, an estimated 95 percent of voters will use auditable paper ballots. That&#8217;s not to say the shift to paper has been problem-free. Some states bought machines that produce a barcode for a paper ballot, which makes it harder for voters to verify. &#8220;The paper that comes out of the machine &#8212; machine-marked paper &#8212; has a barcode on it that is the official vote. No human can read a barcode.&#8221; And in various states, there have been printing errors on mail-in ballots. &#8220;There&#8217;s a different name on the ballot that you&#8217;re supposed to send in.&#8221; Still, when it comes to hacking and widespread fraud, experts agree that paper &#8212; through mail-in voting or with a voter verified paper trail &#8212; is as safe as it gets. &#8220;Having a paper ballot mailed to more and more Americans means there is a traceable way for people to vote. And a way for election monitors to audit later on that those votes were counted the way they were cast. And that they were cast by people eligible to vote.&#8221; The nation&#8217;s voting system is safer than it was four years ago, but some counties didn&#8217;t make the transition and could be more vulnerable. &#8220;The only states with significant amounts of non-paper digital ballots are states like, honestly, Texas.&#8221; Texas, a potential swing state for 2020, lags behind the rest of the country in election security. Harris County, the third largest county in the nation, wasn&#8217;t able to purchase new machines and still has their DREs from 2006. And with the Texas Supreme Court refusing to expand absentee voting and by allowing only one drop box per county, it puts extra pressure on the machines to function smoothly on Election Day. &#8220;A perception hack is a hack that is just big enough to create the illusion of a broad cyberattack. Because if they can manipulate some votes, registration systems, e-poll books, in just a few places, people will assume that they did so everywhere. That&#8217;s the beauty of a perception hack. And four years later, The psychological import of what the Russians did may be greater than anything that they actually hacked into, because they have managed to shake the confidence of American voters that their votes will be counted as they cast them.&#8221; This is Alex. And I&#8217;m Kassie. We produced this episode of &#8220;Stressed Election.&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot going on this election, and we want to make sure we take a deep dive into the major issues. Stick around for the next episodes. We&#8217;re going to cover voting rights, voting technology, disinformation and vote-by-mail.</p></dd></dl><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/31/us/elections/Stressed-Elex-Vote-machines-Onsite4/Stressed-Elex-Vote-machines-Onsite4-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg" alt="Video player loading"><p></p><p></p><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">With early voting underway, states are working to reassure voters that their ballots will be counted as cast.

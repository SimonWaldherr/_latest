<p>The test is "not as sensitive" as the lab-processed PCR test commonly used by the UK's health service, Collinson, the company behind the scheme, said in its press release.</p><p>Passengers have their nose and throat swabbed, and the samples are processed on-site by biotech company Prenetics.</p><p>Lamp tests might be able to detect patients immediately after infection, before symptoms are displayed, Collinson added, but this is "unsure at present."</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-what-to-watch-leading-research-2020-3">Pfizer and Moderna are neck-and-neck in the race to deliver the first effective coronavirus vaccine.

<p>Some countries require proof of a negative result upon arrival. Both Hong Kong and Italy require all travelers from the UK, where cases are relatively high, to provide a negative test before being allowed in, either before departure or on arrival.</p><p>However, the Lamp test will not suffice for Britons traveling to Greece, Cyprus, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. These countries require travelers to take a PCR test.</p><p>Collinson plans to add other pre-departure tests in the future, such as antigen tests, it said.</p><p>In August, Heathrow unveiled a large test-on-arrival facility for passengers built by Collinson and logistics firm Swissport &#8212; but it is still awaiting government approval. If the testing is authorized, it could reduce the length of the current 14-day quarantine period for passengers arriving in the UK from certain countries.</p>

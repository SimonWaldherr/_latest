Adding in a separate tweet: "I didn't think it was possible for someone to be less likeable than Hillary Clinton, but here we are..."

Oh where to start Harlan? Firstly, there's only one reason I can think of that you'd "like" Harris less than Hillary. And while we're at it... can we please drop the obsession with women needing to be "likeable" in the first place? Male politicians we want to be strong, tough, ambitious, leadership material. Women we want to be relatable and compassionate and likeable.

Hill faced a huge backlash on Twitter, with calls for him to be fired from Fox. But he stuck to his guns, later tweeting: “Kamala Harris still sucks and comes off as a b----.”

In a post debate interview, President Trump also called Harris "a monster".

We can't wait for her comeback on this one.

October 7, 2020

The vice presidential debate was a masterclass by Mike Pence in the art of interruption. In the time-honoured tradition of male politicians steamrollering over female candidates, he consistently spoke over her and infringed on her alloted speaking time. According to data by NBC, he cut Harris off 16 times mid-sentence... and we thought the plexi-glass screen between them would be the biggest barrier.

But Harris wasn't having it. "I'm speaking," she said repeatedly, "If you don't mind letting me finish then we can have a conversation". On another occasion, she said to the moderator "He interrupted me and I'd like to finish"... "I would like equal time". Each comeback was accompanied by a wide smile – that thing women running for office are always told to do, to make them look "warm" and "relatable".

It was a clever move by Harris, drawing attention to something previous male candidates have been criticised for (see Trump vs Hillary 2016). It ensured that she swiftly became a meme on social media, as women the world over identified with her: "Kamala Harris speaks for all of us who get interrupted by men".

"I'm Speaking" t-shirts were available to buy no sooner had the debate ended.

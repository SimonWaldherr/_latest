<p>More and more merchants are introducing subscription services to take advantage of consumers&#8217; growing appetite for the services and to reap the benefits of recurring revenue.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.businessinsider.com/products/the-subscription-payments-ecosystem-report?&amp;r=NL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider Intelligence</a> estimates that B2C e-commerce, video streaming, and music streaming alone will bring in over $54 billion in payments volume in the US in 2020, highlighting the market&#8217;s value. With additional opportunities in industries like health and fitness, video games, and transportation, there&#8217;s ample opportunity for merchants to attract revenue and for subscription solutions providers to add more volume.</p>

Subscription payments are defined as payments that recur on a scheduled or usage-based basis for products, memberships, services, and more, offering new and consistent revenue opportunities for merchants.</p>

<p>And because subscription payments see consumers enter their payment information once and have the same account charged in the future, consumers aren&#8217;t present to address any problems after that point, potentially causing merchants and payments providers to lose volume that will be difficult to recover.&#160;</p><p id="in-content-mobile-streamad-slot"></p>



<p>Several types of solution providers are jumping at the opportunity to help merchants handle subscription payments in order to take advantage of the model&#8217;s rise themselves. </p><p id="in-content-dekstop-streamad-slot"></p><p id="ad7-container">
     
</p>




<p>These firms fall into three groups: payments providers like Stripe and PayPal that already handle merchants&#8217; payments and are offering additional solutions specific to subscriptions.</p>



<p>Subscription-dedicated solutions providers, such as Ordergroove and Recurly, that don&#8217;t process payments but do offer tools that help merchants with many stages of the subscription process, including payments.</p><h3 class="section-title">Lees ook op Business Insider</h3>

President Trump on Tuesday claimed that Joe Biden’s “dementia” is “getting worse,” continuing to hammer the former vice president for seeming to forget Sen. Mitt Romney’s name and for saying he was running for the Senate on Monday.

“Mitt can’t be thrilled about this! Joe also said yesterday he’s running for the U.S. Senate (again) and totally forgot where he was (wrong State!),” the president wrote on Twitter. “Joe has never been a nice or kind guy, so it’s easier to find this obvious & rapidly getting worse ‘dementia’ unacceptable for USA!”

The Democratic presidential nominee seemed to lose his train of thought when asked a question by a reporter about whether Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s Catholic faith was fair game for questions at her Senate confirmation hearing.

Biden said he “got in trouble” before for questioning somebody’s faith.

“You may remember, I got in trouble when we were running against that senator who was a Mormon, the governor,” Biden said, referring to Romney, the Republican senator from Utah and former Massachusetts governor who ran against President Barack Obama in 2012.

At a campaign event in Toledo, Ohio, Biden accidentally said he was running for the Senate.

“You know, we have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate, when I ran as a proud Democrat for vice president, and I’m running as a proud Democrat for president. But I promise you this, I will govern as an American president,” Biden, 77, a former senator from Delaware, said.

Trump quickly responded.

“‘I’m running as a proud Democrat, for the Senate’. Sleepy Joe Biden today,” Trump tweeted on Monday. “It’s only going to get worse. It is not sustainable for our County [sic] – China will own us!!!!”

Later, at a campaign rally in Sanford, Fla., Trump, 74, once again called out Biden’s error.

“Sleepy Joe Biden, not a nice guy, by the way … He had a very bad day today,” the president told his supporters.

“If I ever had a day like he had today, they’d say ‘It’s over. It’s over.’ … He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. He didn’t know what state he was in. And he said today he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate,” Trump continued.

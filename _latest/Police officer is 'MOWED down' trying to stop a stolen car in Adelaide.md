A police officer has been mowed down after trying to stop a stolen car in Adelaide.

He was hit while trying to deploy road spikes to stop a Volkswagen Amarok in Everard Park, south Adelaide, on Friday afternoon.

The officer was not seriously injured and was treated at the scene by paramedics.

The stolen white ute was first spotted on Flaxmill Road, in Christie Downs, at about 12.30pm and officers ran its registration.

A police officer was mowed down in the south of Adelaide on Friday afternoon (pictured with paramedics) after trying to deploy road spikes to stop a stolen white Volkswagen Amarok ute

The officer was hit by a member of the public's car in Everard Park and was not seriously injured. He was treated at the scene by paramedics (pictured above)

The registration checks found the car had been stolen from a Noarlunga Centre car wash on Thursday morning.

The Volkswagen was not pursued on land and instead PolAir was used to monitor the ute's location.

Police tracked the car through Adelaide's inner southern and western suburbs for over 30 minutes.

A police officer then tried to deploy road spikes to stop the ute and was hit by another car on Anzac Highway at Everard Park.

Police spotted the stolen white ute at 12.30pm on Friday. They monitored the ute's location before attempting to stop the driver (police officer being treated by paramedics pictured)

The Volkswagen was dumped near Colley Terrace, in Glenelg, and the male driver ran off.

He was arrested by SA Police in a nearby car park.

The man is expected to be charged on Friday afternoon.

Anzac Highway is currently closed to all city bound traffic from South Road at Everard Park.

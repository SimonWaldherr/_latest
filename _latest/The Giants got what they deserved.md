For a while there, you were asking yourself: Who were those guys?

Who were those guys in blue?

Who were those guys punching the Cowboys in the nose?

Who were those guys representing their blue-collar fans with such blue-collar relentlessness?

Who was that offensive coordinator calling for sweeps and screens, who apparently had been playing possum with play-calling so unimaginative that it made you wonder whether he was saving his best stuff for Jerry Jones and his old Cowboys friends?

Was that really Jason Garrett?

Who were those guys finding the end zone for the first time in 20 drives without the need for a GPS on an end-around to Evan Engram?

They were imposters.

Because then they remembered who the New York Football Giants truly are.

And when Winning Time arrived, they had no idea what to do.

Here was Daniel Jones’ chance.

One minute, 50 seconds and one timeout left, his 24-yard line.

Giants 34, Cowboys 34.

Under too much duress, he couldn’t play the hero.

Couldn’t march his team down the field to win it.

And after Andy Dalton found Michael Gallup deep down the right sideline against Ryan Lewis, Greg Zuerlein booted the Giants, 37-34 losers, out of their misery.

Dalton was the quarterback because a tearful Dak Prescott had been knocked out in the third quarter and was undergoing surgery for a broken ankle.

Think about that: Big Blue could not stop Andy Dalton with a little over a minute left and the game on the line.

The Giants deserve to be 0-5.

They deserve to be 0-5 because they gave us a comedy of errors that won’t have Joe Judge laughing, because the last thing he wants and needs this team to do is beat itself.

And so the Giants got what they deserved, a dispiriting 37-34 defeat.

The Giants deserve to be 0-5.

The comedy of errors, please:

Daniel Jones is sacked by Demarcus Lawrence (thank you Andrew Thomas) and Anthony Brown returns the fumble for a 29-yard TD.

Giants 17, Cowboys 17.

Turnover No. 31 for Jones in 17 games. Lost fumble No. 14.

A fake field goal Riley Dixon-to-Evan Engram TD is negated by an illegal shift called on Cameron Fleming.

Judge slams his headset down in disgust, disbelief or both.

Field goal instead of touchdown.

Jones finds Darius Slayton wide open with a 31-yard TD pass.

Flag.

Offensive interference on Damion Ratley.

Field goal instead of touchdown.

Jones had clawed back from Cowboys 31, Giants 23 with a 39-yard strike to Slayton that positioned the automatic Graham Gano FG.

Jones fired a third-and-6 bullet over the middle to Slayton after Blake Martinez had recovered an aborted Dalton fumble at the Dallas 17 and hard-running Devonta Freeman made it Giants 34, Cowboys 31.

Joe Judge has done the job winning the respect of the locker room with his football knowledge and with his teaching and with his relationship building.

And that is a big part of the job description, especially for a franchise that has fallen and can’t get up and has forgotten how to win.

But it isn’t enough to fight like hell.

No medals for trying, or for fighting either.

The Giants still have yet to learn how to win.

And got what they deserved.

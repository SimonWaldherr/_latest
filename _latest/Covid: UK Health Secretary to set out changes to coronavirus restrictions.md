Every area of England now falls into three categories - medium (Tier One), high (Tier Two) or very high (Tier Three), depending on the local rate of infection.

Areas in Tier One are subject to the basic national rules previously in force.

You may not meet in a group of more than six people, indoors or outdoors, unless you're in a larger household or a support bubble.

Pubs, bars and restaurants in a Tier One area must close by 22:00.

The rules for Tier One also apply in Tier Two. In addition, you are not allowed to meet socially with people you do not live with indoors - this includes private homes, as well as pubs or restaurants.

People in support bubbles can go on meeting as before and informal childcare may also be provided.

You can still meet friends and family outdoors, but only in a group of up to six people.

Areas with the most rapidly rising transmission rates are placed in Tier Three.

You are not allowed to meet socially with anybody who is not part of your household or your support bubble indoors or in certain outdoor locations.

You cannot meet in private gardens or pub gardens, but can meet in parks, beaches, countryside or forests, as long as you are not in a group of more than six.

Pubs and bars must close unless they are serving substantial meals - alcohol can only be served as part of a meal.

People are being advised not to travel into or out of Tier Three areas, other than for work, education, youth services or because of caring responsibilities.

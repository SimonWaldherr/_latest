<p>&#8220;We are overjoyed that she was found safely today. We would like to thank the rangers and search teams who relentlessly looked for her day and night and never gave up hope,&#8221; her family said in a statement provided by the park service.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>The statement said a &#8220;credible tip&#8221; from a park visitor, who said they had seen Courtier within the park, led to her rescue. But officials did not provide information about Courtier&#8217;s condition or the location where she was found. A park service spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.</p><p>Courtier&#8217;s daughter, Kailey Chambers, chronicled the search for her mother in the 148,000-acre park and sought tips through the website <a class="link" href="https://helpfindholly.com/" target="_blank">HelpFindHolly.com.</a></p><p>Last week, Chambers posted on Instagram: &#8220;The rangers have informed me that unless they gather additional intel they will only be continuing their search for 1-2 more days. It&#8217;s getting down to the final few days of survival without food.&#8221;</p><p>Chambers has said her mother is an experienced hiker who is familiar with Zion National Park and has done solo hikes in the past. She told KCBS-TV Channel 2 last week that Courtier had been visiting national parks across the country in a converted van after losing her job as a nanny during the pandemic.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>Officials from numerous agencies, including the park service, Washington County Sheriff&#8217;s Office and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, as well as volunteers, aided in the search for Courtier.</p><p>&#8220;We are also so grateful to the countless volunteers who were generous with their time, resources and support. This wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the network of people who came together,&#8221; Courtier&#8217;s family&#8217;s statement said.</p></div>

And with the No. 8 pick in the NBA draft, the Knicks select …

Nobody.

According to two league sources, the Knicks are seriously mulling trading back in the Nov. 18 draft unless big man James Wiseman or point guard LaMelo Ball fall back to the eighth spot.

It’s become increasingly clear the Knicks’ top priority, Ball, is unlikely to slide. Wiseman, the athletic 7-foot-1 center from Memphis, has seen some mock-draft fluctuations.

However, most NBA draft sources believe it’s improbable Wiseman will make it to No. 8, leaving the Knicks in a quandary.

One source senses the Knicks have Ball and Wiseman as two players they absolutely “love,” and haven’t been as smitten yet with any other prospect in a consensus weak draft.

At No. 8, the Knicks have staged internal talks about swapping back with a team in the Nos. 12-15 range to gain a young player in his rookie contract while still making a lottery pick.

One player that’s been on their radar as a late-lottery guy is combo guard Tyrese Maxey, a one-and-doner from Kentucky.

Maxey has an ardent fan in Knicks assistant coach Kenny Payne, who coached him at Kentucky last season.

Senior vice president William Wesley, as a former CAA consultant and close adviser to John Calipari, is also a big advocate of anything Kentucky.

“I think he’d be a good fit for any team,” Payne told The Post this summer before getting hired by the Knicks. “In the next couple of years, he’s going to be one of those guys you look back on and people say: ‘Wow, I knew he was good, I didn’t know he was that good.’ ”

One source said by trading into the teens, it will also put less pressure on their lottery pick than if he were taken at No. 8.

“You take someone at 8, you expect a home run,’’ the source said. “I don’t know if they think there’s a home-run guy there. I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t make that pick.’’

Teams right behind the Knicks are Washington (9), Phoenix (10), San Antonio (11), Sacramento (12), New Orleans (13), Boston (14) and Orlando (15).

According to an NBA source, Orlando has shown interest in Dennis Smith Jr., so a bigger deal could work with the Magic if they swap the No. 8 and No. 15 slots.

In his only remarks about the draft, Knicks rookie president Leon Rose said over the summer, “This draft, a couple of guys stand out, and after that, there’s a lot of equality.”

It is a little surprising the Knicks have such a yen for Wiseman considering they have center Mitchell Robinson, the shot-blocking demon who set the NBA record for highest field-goal percentage (74.2 percent) last season.

Robinson, however, missed the “Delete 8’’ group practices for “personal reasons.” The Knicks were quarantined in a hotel bubble and Robinson passed on it.

The 7-foot-1 center Wiseman, who runs the court like a deer, played just three games at Memphis averaging 19.7 points and 10.7 rebounds, shooting 76 percent. He was suspended by the NCAA for receiving “impermissible benefits.”

The pandemic has given NBA scouts a large challenge in analyzing the top college players because the conference tournaments, NCAA Tournament and live draft combines/interviews were scrapped because of COVID-19 protocols.

Teams have been permitted to interview players via Zoom and watch their workouts virtually. In that scouting environment, the draft could be as unpredictable as any in recent memory with the best players potentially falling into the teens.

The Knicks also select 27th as they have the Clippers’ pick and could look to move up into the mid first-round by packaging their second-round pick (No. 38).

Maisie wrote: 'It's hard to tell who's who, spot the difference'.

The blonde beauty recently admitted she is 'on a mission' to get as fit as possible, with her eyes firmly set on the glitterball trophy as she takes on Strictly Come Dancing 2020.

Maisie, who stars as Tiffany Butcher on the hit BBC soap, won Strictly's Children In Need special alongside Kevin Clifton last year – making her a favourite to win.

It's also been reported she's been the number one choice for the male pros, given her prior experience in the ballroom.

A source told The Sun: 'All the male pros really want to partner with her, not just because she’s young and fit, but she’s also proven herself to be a brilliant dancer.

Meanwhile, the auburn-haired beauty also reportedly turned down a record deal – which promised to make her 'the next Kylie Minogue' – so that she could take part on Strictly this year.

She is said to have been told by BBC bosses that the singing career would need to be put on hold if she wanted to remain on EastEnders and take part in Strictly.

An insider added to the publication: 'Maisie wants to crack the music industry and several labels think she is really marketable. One told her she could be the next Kylie, with her girl-next-door looks and down-to-earth personality.

'But she was told she could not take a record deal and continue on EastEnders and Strictly due to the BBC’s commercial rules.'

<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Sunday urged Americans to continue their fight against the coronavirus by social distancing and wearing masks, while cautioning that it wasn't easy for many to follow the health guidelines.</p><p>On NBC's "Meet the Press," Azar said that the people of the country have endured many challenges in the fight against the highly contagious virus and pleaded with them to continue their efforts.</p><p>"We're seeing mitigation fatigue right now and, you know, I just hope that &#8212; we have so much promise in the weeks and months ahead, next generation therapeutics, safe and effective vaccines," he said.</p><p>He continued: "My message to the American people, please practice those three W's: Wash your hands, watch your distance, wear your face coverings when you can't watch your distance ... Be mindful of those indoor household gatherings. Just because you're related to someone or friends with someone doesn't mean you can't transmit or get transmitted to."</p>

"We're seeing that in Europe. People are tired. The American people have given so much. People of Europe have given so much. They've been locked down. They've been isolated and they're tired."</p><p>Todd then pressed Azar on why the president campaigned in Janesville, Wisconsin, on Saturday. The perennial presidential battleground state has seen a surge in coronavirus infections over the past few weeks and is considered a hot spot for the virus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/wisconsin-coronavirus-election.html">according to The New York Times</a>.</p><p>"We're seeing an increase in cases in states, whether red or blue or open or closed," Azar said. "Some countries, on a population-adjusted basis, have two or three times what we have in the US. The ticket is in our own hands."</p>

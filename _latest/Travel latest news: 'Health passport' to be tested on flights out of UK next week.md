Digital “health passports” are to be tested on flights out of the UK for the first time next week under a plan to cut quarantine and enable Covid-safe air travel.

Britons flying from Heathrow to Newark Liberty International Airport, a major airport in the New York Metropolitan area, will be among the first in the world to travel using the digital health document.

UK travellers will be screened for Covid-19 at Heathrow’s testing facility up to 72 hours before travel and will complete health questionnaires required by US border authorities.

Results will be stored on the Commonpass smartphone app, which can be scanned by airlines and border officials to check that the passengers are Covid-free.

If trials are successful, the scheme could allow passengers to reduce their time in quarantine.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps this week unveiled two potential approaches to reducing quarantine times for UK travellers – a test a week after arriving in the country, with release from quarantine with a negative results, and a “trailblazer” system where tests and isolation take place prior to travel.

  Are pubs and restaurants really driving the rise in Covid cases? None of the data say so 
description: > 
  A decision to close pubs and restaurants in the north of England now looks inevitable.On Thursday, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, briefed nearly 150 MPs, warning them that the hospitality sector is driving soaring case rates.NHS Test and Trace has been recording the locations at which infected people met close contacts who were later found to have the virus.In the report, PHE even accepts that "this is the potential exposure setting".Only around five per cent reported close contact in a "leisure or community" setting â€“ and that category bundled together pubs, restaurants, places of worship, celebrations, entertainment, organised trips and community activities.

<div><p>A decision to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/07/prime-minister-may-shut-pubs-despite-mounting-labour-opposition/">close pubs and restaurants</a> in the north of England now looks inevitable.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, briefed nearly 150 MPs, warning them that the hospitality sector is driving <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-covid-news-trump-scotland-lockdown-uk-cases/">soaring case rates</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that none of the published data shows that to be the case.</p>
<p>NHS Test and Trace has been recording the locations at which infected people met close contacts who were later found to have the virus.&#160;Overwhelmingly, that was <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-uk-trace-cases-deaths-students-lockdown-vaccine/">in the home</a>.</p>
<p>Figures released last Friday in the weekly Public Health England (PHE) surveillance report show that more than three-quarters of people &#8211; 75.3 per cent &#8211; contacted by tracers came into contact with an infected person either in their own home or someone else's.&#160;</p>
<p>In the report, PHE even accepts that "this is the potential exposure setting".</p>
<p>Only around five per cent reported close contact in a "leisure or community" setting&#160;&#8211; and that category bundled together pubs, restaurants, places of worship, celebrations, entertainment, organised trips and community activities.</p>

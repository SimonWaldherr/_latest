<div><p>The year 2019 was absolutely golden for <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/christian-lee/">Christian &#8220;The Warrior&#8221; Lee</a>, who captured the ONE Lightweight World Title and the ONE Lightweight World Grand Prix Championship.</p>
<p>Now, the reigning king will make his first World Title defense against #1-ranked contender <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/iuri-lapicus/">Iuri Lapicus</a> at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/inside-the-matrix/">ONE: INSIDE THE MATRIX</a> in Singapore on Friday, 30 October.</p>
<p>As he looks to keep building his legacy, &#8220;The Warrior&#8221; does not anticipate a long night inside the Circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to meet in the center of the cage, and my experience is going to come into play,&#8221; Lee states. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get a first-round TKO finish.&#8221;</p>
<p class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"></p>
<p>The Hawaii-based Singaporean has reason to be confident in his striking after finishing eight of his professional bouts by knockout, including three of his previous four.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his two most recent fights showcased his development into the best lightweight in the world.</p>
<p>First, Lee upset then-titleholder, Japanese mixed martial arts legend <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/shinya-aoki/">Shinya &#8220;Tobikan Judan&#8221; Aoki</a>, to claim the ONE Lightweight World Title at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/enter-the-dragon/">ONE: ENTER THE DRAGON</a> in May 2019.</p>
<p>Next, on just 10 days&#8217; notice, he defeated <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/saygid-guseyn-arslanaliev/">Saygid &#8220;Dagi&#8221; Guseyn Arslanaliev</a> to win the ONE Lightweight World Grand Prix Championship at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/century/">ONE: CENTURY</a> later that October.</p>

 

<p>While this is technically his first ONE Lightweight World Title defense, &#8220;The Warrior&#8221; believes his win over Arslanaliev made a similar statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people say that you&#8217;re not a true World Champion until you defend the belt, and in many ways, that is true. But once you win the belt, you win the belt,&#8221; Lee explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although this is my first title defense, taking on &#8216;Dagi&#8217; in the Grand Prix Final was really my first title defense, as he was the top lightweight contender.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any case, the next step in Lee&#8217;s journey will see him attempt to stop a fast-moving train.</p>
 
<p>Lapcius&#8217; status as the #1 lightweight contender in <a href="https://www.onefc.com/rankings/">ONE&#8217;s Athlete Rankings</a> is well-deserved. At 14-0, the dominant Moldovan has finished every one of his opponents, including the athletes he faced in his ONE Championship run.</p>
<p>The Moldovan enjoyed a successful promotional debut, as he dominated Thai mixed martial arts pioneer <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/shannon-wiratchai/">Shannon &#8220;OneShin&#8221; Wiratchai</a> en route to a third-round TKO in May 2019.</p>
<p>Then, he stamped his ticket to a title shot with a jaw-dropping 67-second rear-naked choke victory over former ONE Featherweight World Champion <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/marat-gafurov/">Marat &#8220;Cobra&#8221; Gafurov</a> at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/warriors-code/">ONE: WARRIOR&#8217;S CODE</a> in February. It was not just a statement, but an announcement that he would be a major player in the division and one of Europe&#8217;s next big stars.</p>
<p>But even before that big win over Gafurov, Lee had zeroed in on the Team Petrosyan representative.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was already training with him as the opponent in mind,&#8221; the reigning World Champion says.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Iuri Lapicus, I was really excited to hear that he was going to be my first fight back. He&#8217;s done well in his career to earn that #1-contender spot. I give all the credit to him, and I think he&#8217;s definitely a worthy opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is his first title shot and a big opportunity. When he steps into the Circle with me, he&#8217;s going to come out guns blazing, trying to take my head off. I do feel like that if it does go into the later rounds, I will have the edge over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But just the way our styles match up, I feel like it&#8217;s going to be an early clash, and we&#8217;re going to see who&#8217;s got the better of each other.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-204993" src="https://cdn.onefc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Iuri-Lapicus-defeats-Marat-Gafurov-ONE-WARRIORS-CODE-DC-1327.jpg" alt="Team Petrosyan's Iuri Lapicus cracks Marat Gafurov in February 2020" width="1920" height="1280"></p>
<p>Despite the extended break due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Singaporean believes fans will see the best version of himself in the Circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the long layoff during this time, it&#8217;s actually been really great for me,&#8221; Lee says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve still been in the gym, training every single day, but I was able to let my body rest, let my mind rest, and spend a lot of quality time with my wife and family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond his own matchup, &#8220;The Warrior&#8221; is simply excited to be part of a mega event that features four World Championship bouts. And he doesn&#8217;t plan to shrink despite being under the microscope.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be huge. It&#8217;s definitely going to be the most-watched ONE Championship event of the year so far. I&#8217;m very excited and honored to be a part of such a big event. I&#8217;m so grateful to be back in action,&#8221; Lee says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I embrace the pressure. Pressure is part of what makes this sport so interesting, and it&#8217;s part of being a World Champion. It&#8217;s going to be nothing new for me. I&#8217;m just excited to make a statement in my first title defense. There&#8217;s going to be pressure, but it&#8217;s going to be good pressure.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if pressure makes diamonds, the 22-year-old expects his World Title defense to shine the brightest in Singapore.</p>
<p>&#8220;My fight is going to be the most exciting because I&#8217;m going to bring the fight from start to finish. I have no reservations when I step into that Circle,&#8221; he continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking about the belt or pleasing any fans or anybody else. I&#8217;m just worried about stepping in there and taking out the man in front of me as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>For now, that man is Lapicus. But there are other contenders waiting in the wings &#8211; contenders that Lee plans to knock off one by one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like winning the belt just marked the start of my journey,&#8221; the reigning king says. &#8220;From there, I plan on taking out every contender in the division until there&#8217;s no one left.&#8221;</p>

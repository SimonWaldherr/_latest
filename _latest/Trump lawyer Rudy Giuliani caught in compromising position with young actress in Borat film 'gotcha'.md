<div><p>Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump&#8217;s personal lawyer and former New York mayor, has been caught in a compromising situation with a young actress while unsuspectingly being filmed for the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-review-trump-rallies-ugly-songs-truly/">latest Borat film.</a></p>
<p>Mr Giuliani was invited to a hotel in Manhattan in July by a member of comedian and director Sacha Baron Cohen&#8217;s team posing as a Russian reporter who said she wanted to talk about the president&#8217;s coronavirus handling.</p>
<p>The journalist, played by Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova, 24, starts off by discussing the virus and where it might have started with Mr Giuliani, 76.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with a bat,&#8221; Mr Giuliani says. &#8220;Have you ever eaten a bat?&#8221; he asks the reporter, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-review-trump-rallies-ugly-songs-truly/">who gets him to agree to try one.</a></p>
<p>After they stop filming, she then invites the two-term mayor into the bedroom next door for a drink. She tells him she is nervous, to which he replies: &#8220;I&#8217;ll relax you, you want me to ask you a question?&#8221;</p>

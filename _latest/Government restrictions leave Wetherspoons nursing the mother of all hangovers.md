  Government restrictions leave Wetherspoons nursing the mother of all hangovers 
description: > 
  That’s already ancient history though.A bigger concern will be how its pubs have performed since reopening after lockdown.Answer: reasonably well, until a new wave of restrictions were brought in, leaving sales 15pc below last year in the 11 weeks since the end of July.That’s worse than Marston’s, which yesterday reported a 10pc shortfall over a similar timeframe and over 2,000 job cuts.This is probably because Wetherspoon pubs tend to be in city centres, whereas its rival is more heavily concentrated in the suburbs.

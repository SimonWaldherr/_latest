After teasing his upcoming collaboration with New Balance on Instagram earlier this year, Salehe Bembury’s take on the ML2002R1 sneaker is set to release soon.

The Versace Vice President of Sneakers and Men’s Footwear took to Instagram in April to unveil a glimpse of the sneaker’s orange laces, alongside a prominent branded lace-keeper featuring Bembury’s name in blue block lettering. In November, Bembury spoke to HYPEBEAST about the inspiration behind the shoe as well.

Inspired by the palette of Antelope Canyon — a slot canyon located in the American Southwest, Arizona — the full sneaker has been unveiled, showcasing vibrant colors that have been reflected by a depth in suede and a variety of textures throughout the shoe. “Peace be the journey” is the theme of the collaboration, with shades of orange and blue representing the earthy tones discovered in the great outdoors.

The New Balance x Salehe Bembury ML2002R1 will release October 23 and will be available from the New Balance webstore.

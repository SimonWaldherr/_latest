Kylie Jenner looked to be ready to party on Thursday evening.

The 23-year-old makeup mogul and mother to daughter Stormi shared images to Instagram where she was dressed up in a one-should gown while showing off her very long 'claws' as she was behind the wheel of a car.

These posts come just after her physical fight with older supermodel sister Kendall Jenner aired on Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

Glam slam: Kylie Jenner looked to be ready to party on Thursday evening. The 23-year-old makeup mogul and mother to daughter Stormi shared images to Instagram where she was dressed up in a one-should gown

The new photos were shared on the Kylie Skin star's Instagram Stories.

With a stunning gown on that included a one-strap and what looked like a sleeve with a swirly beige and green tiger print, Jenner glowed.

Her hair was pulled back and she modeled bronze hued makeup toned with winged eyeliner.

The siren was seated in a car as she took the selfies while her gold jewelry sparkled.

The TV veteran was also seen in close up as she had on a dark jacket. Her face looked blurry with the fuzzy image.

The there were the photos of her very long and pointy brown 'claws.'

'Love my claws,' she noted as she sat in the driver's seat of a car. She explained earlier this week that she got the nails for a photo shoot and was having difficulty adjusting to them.

But it seems as if the daughter of Kris Jenner now enjoys them.

The social media star also shared a throwback photo with her mother Kris dressed up for Halloween costume while outfit showing off her legs.

Kendall was a pirate in black and red with a headscarf on and a black necklace as well as a full face of makeup.

And Kylie was a pirate as well though she went for white and black with hoop earrings.

This comes just after her fight with her older sister aired on KUWTK.

Kendall, 24, accused Kylie of 'putting her heel in her neck' during the brawl, leading the sisters to vow to 'never speak to one another again.'

Kim, 39, could be heard shouting: 'It's an emergency! Go get Kendall!' as she listened to her sisters brawling in another vehicle, played over 41-year-old Kourtney's phone.

'F*** you! F*** you!' Kendall, 24, screamed at Kylie (pictured) as the altercation took place

The row happened because Kendall was upset that Kylie took her outfit during the family getaway in Palm Springs, California.

'F*** you! F*** you!' Kendall screamed at Kylie and her mother's boyfriend, Corey Gamble, 39, who was riding with them.

'Stop, stop, stop!' Corey yelled.

'We have to go get Kendall!' Kim told her driver, taking command. 'Turn around, sir!'

'Where are they? This is crazy!' Khloé, 36, exclaimed, as Kendall told Kylie, 'You put your f***ing heel into my f***ing neck!'

Ride argument: Kylie and Kendall argued about riding together as their mother Kris Jenner and half-sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloe listened in

'That's cause you f***ing slapped me!' Kylie yelled back.

In a confessional, Khloé recalled, 'We're just hearing high-pitched screaming. We can't even figure out what's happening, and it just sounds really crazy.'

When Kim's car stopped, a producer ran up and told her, 'They left in the other car.'

'We need to find them,' said a worried looking Kourtney.

Good times: Kris, Kim, Khloe and Kourtney were having a fun ride home when Kendall called in distress

Really crazy: 'In a confessional, Khloé recalled, 'We're just hearing high-pitched screaming. We can't even figure out what's happening, and it just sounds really crazy'

Kendall suddenly crawled into their car, swearing, 'I will never speak to Kylie again, ever.'

The fight was a horrifying moment for the whole family, not least Kris Jenner, 64, who had just been grappling with seeing Kim, Kourtney and Khloé fight in a recent KUWTK episode.

At a KKW Beauty shoot, she told Kim and Khloé that it had been hard to watch her girls argue so vehemently at their age, and she called Kourtney to offer her support.

'Thank you,' Kourtney replied, crying. 'I'm fine now. It's just… it was like everyone was ganging up on me for like two f***ing years.'

'It's just such a natural thing in our family,' she told her mother. 'If someone goes any way against what everyone else is doing, it just seems like they just attack.'

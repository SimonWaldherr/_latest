Earlier this year, the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned that the damage to children caused by missing out on school would last a lifetime.

Disadvantaged pupils have been the most adversely affected, and Michael Gove admitted in May that the progress in closing the gap between the richest and poorest had been put back by lockdown.

An extended half-term would also present problems for parents who would have to once again grapple with childcare on top of work.

While any "circuit-breaker" may be described as a temporary measure, reopening schools again if cases did not fall could prove difficult.

Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said teachers understood the adverse impact that closing schools for an extra week would have on children's education but added: "We also understand that, in exponential epidemics, early action is essential.

"Taking action now can avoid more disruption later. The Government must not just turn a blind eye and pretend all is going to be OK."

Earlier this year, Mr Courtney told the union's 450,000 members not to "engage" with the Government's plans to reopen primary schools following the May half-term.

The NEU's calls for children to stay at home for an extended half term break put it at odds with ministers, who are keen for schools to remain open even in parts of the country deemed to be "very high" risk.

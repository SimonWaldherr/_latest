The feds and Twitter are investigating an apparent hack of C-SPAN political editor Steve Scully’s account, the Commission on Presidential Debates said.

“Steve Scully notified us that his Twitter account was hacked. CPD reported the apparent hack to the FBI and Twitter, and we understand that the federal authorities and Twitter are looking into the issue,” the commission said on its official Twitter feed.

Scully raised eyebrows Friday after a message posted to his Twitter account seemed to ask Anthony Scaramucci on whether to respond to criticism Scully received from President Trump.

“@Scaramucci should I respond to trump,” Scully wrote.

“Ignore. He is having a hard enough time. Some more bad stuff about to go down,” said “The Mooch,” who has become a ferocious Trump critic after a brief and stormy stint as White House communications director in 2017.

The veteran DC journalist has long been plagued by hacks, according to a review of his records by Fox News.

“I apologize for Saturday’s tweets regarding weight loss, etc. I still have my day job at C-SPAN … darn those hackers. Have a great Sunday,” Scully wrote in May 2012.

There was another hack in March 2013.

Scully had been set to host the second presidential debate between Trump and Biden before it was canceled by the commission Friday night.

Twitter declined comment.

Even limited shutdowns have consequences. National lockdowns like the one seen in Ireland can take a brutal toll on the economy. The return of lockdowns highlights an uncomfortable reality: Despite significant medical advances in the treatment of covid-19 and an unprecedented race to find a vaccine to beat the virus, the only proven measures to stop its rampant spread as of yet are crude, perhaps draconian limits on human interaction.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The return to lockdowns is a sign of desperation.</p></div>

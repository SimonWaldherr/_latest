WASHINGTON — Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett demonstrated the depths of her judicial knowledge on Tuesday as she responded to hours of questioning with zero notes in front of her.

The conservative judge was pressed on her legal views during day two of her confirmation hearings and recalled judgment after judgment, of hers and of other courts, when GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas asked her after several hours how she had prepared.

“You know most of us have multiple notebooks and notes and books and things like that in front of us,” Cornyn said.

“Can you hold up what you’ve been referring to in answering our questions?” he asked.

Coney Barrett broke into a smile and held up a blank notepad as the hearing room broke into laughter.

“Is there anything on it?” Cornyn pressed.

“The letterhead that says ‘United States Senate,'” Coney Barrett responded.

“That’s impressive,” he said.

Barrett, 48, was nominated last month to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

The New Orleans-born lawmaker who serves as a circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has been lauded as a brilliant legal mind but her Catholic views have come under fire from liberals.

Coney Barrett, a mom-of-seven, has spoken critically of the Affordable Care Act in the past and is personally pro-life. She also has published opinions which concern Democratic lawmakers who believe Coney Barrett could repeal the ACA during SCOTUS hearings following the election.

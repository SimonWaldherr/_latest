description: > 
  British Airways has apologised for asking a holidaymaker to pay £438 for an extra night’s accommodation after cancelling their original flight home.But in common with other airlines, British Airways is cancelling a large number of lightly booked flights – among them, Mr McGill’s inbound departure from the Caribbean to London Gatwick.British Airways told him he would either need to pay an additional £438 for an extra night at his resort, or “accept the new flight and make your own arrangements for the last night”.After The Independent contacted British Airways, the airline said: “We are sorry for the confusion caused by the individual error of one of our colleagues in this instance when setting out the options available to this customer.“We have now contacted the customer and clarified their options regarding this holiday and are pleased we have found a resolution for them.”

The mayor of Liverpool has said he expects the city to be put in a tier three lockdown within days.

Joe Anderson said following conversations with Downing Street he expects the city will be in the 'new lockdown' which will be enacted in Parliament on Tuesday.

A three-tier lockdown system is set to be announced next week, with the worst-affected areas classed as Tier 3 and facing the harshest restrictions.

Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle are expected to be added to this group.

Mr Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday: "We had some conversations with Downing Street yesterday, we have got further conversations, discussions with them this afternoon.

"And I expect that Liverpool will be one of those announced.

"We will be in the local lockdown, new local lockdown, which is announced, which will probably be, well, will be tier three, and that that will be enacted in Parliament on Tuesday.

"We are continuing the discussions and conversations today."

Tier 3 measures are expected to include compulsory closure of hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants, while mixing with other households won't be allowed.

Tier 2 areas are also expected to be hit by a ban on meeting people you don't live with, although pubs and restaurants would be allowed to stay open.

Places with lowest infection rates will still have to stick to the "rule of six" and 10pm curfews currently in place across England.

The Liverpool Mayor added: "Now we are engaged in a conversation that's telling us that these decisions have been made, so that's... a conversation, not a consultation.

"But the main point of the imposition of the measures are clearly that: imposition. We have not be consulted."

Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England's national infection service told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The picture shows that all over the country the numbers of cases are rising.

"They are rising more quickly in the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and Humber than they are in the south of the country.

"Concerning aspects in terms of the North West is that in certain pockets of the North West it is rising quite fast now in the over-60s.

"And that's the group of people that we know would need admission to hospital more significantly than the younger population."

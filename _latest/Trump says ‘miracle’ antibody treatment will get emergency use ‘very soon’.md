President Trump on Sunday said emergency use authorization should be coming “very soon” so that everybody can get the “miracle” antibody treatment he believes is a “cure” for coronavirus.

“I know people call it a therapeutic, but to me it’s a cure,” Trump told Fox News of Regeneron’s experimental cocktail of monoclonal antibodies he took while hospitalized from COVID-19.

“We’re going to be delivering that to hospitals — we’re waiting for the emergency use authorization,” he said, promising it would be coming “very soon.”

“We’re going to be delivering that to hospitals all over the country — and ultimately all over the world — because it’s it’s incredible,” he said, calling the treatment made by a New York-based firm a “miracle.”

“We’ll clean out the hospitals — we’ll get everybody out of the hospitals,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

Trump again said he “felt really good almost after taking it” — while stressing that he “would have done well anyway” battling the contagion because he is so healthy.

“But, you know, who wants to take a chance, as the expression goes,” he said.

<div><p>It was the pen pot on the desk that tipped us over the edge. I wanted it there so I could grab a pen during an important work call. My husband thought it was cluttering up a workspace that should ideally be kept as clear as possible, given that it was also our bedroom.</p>
<p>Voices were raised, doors were slammed and pens were thrown, at which point we realised that something had to give. Quite simply, six months of trying to conduct two highly-pressurised jobs from the flat we share with our three children, an au pair and the cat, was not working for us any more.</p>
<p>So I did what any enraged spouse might do after a particularly explosive row &#8211; I checked into a hotel.</p>
<p>Luckily, for the sake of our marriage, it was just for the day. But I&#8217;m not ashamed to say that I jumped at the chance to spend a rainy Friday working, not from the desk in our bedroom, but from a suite at the Athenaeum Hotel on London&#8217;s Piccadilly. In a bid to try and halt the desperate slide towards Covid-induced unviability, the hotel has started to offer its rooms up as private office spaces during the working day, complete with all the amenities a five-star hotel has to offer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest example of how the hospitality industry has had to pivot to survive tough times. During lockdown, suddenly empty hotels offered accommodation to key workers such as police officers and hospital staff. Now, as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/please-dont-make-return-working-home/">cabin fever sets in</a> for those who have worked from home for half this year and face another six months of pen-based arguments, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/guest-cottages-luxury-boffices-saving-alpha-marriages-work-home/">hotels, cafes and pubs are offering up their tables as desks</a>, with some pubs charging between &#163;10 and &#163;20 a day, in exchange for Wi-Fi, some food and drink, and a change of scenery.</p>

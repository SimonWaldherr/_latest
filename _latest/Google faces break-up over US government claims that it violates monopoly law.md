  Google faces break-up over US government claims that it violates monopoly law 
description: > 
  The US Government has launched a landmark antitrust case against Google which could trigger the break-up of the $1 trillion tech behemoth.This allows Google to crush rivals and hammers choice for its customers, the DoJ claimed in its biggest trust-busting action for decades.Prosecutors claimed that Google had “foreclosed competition for internet search” and that competitors are “denied vital distribution, scale, and product recognition”.The Justice Department’s lawsuit focused on so-called exclusionary agreements that which Google has reached with other tech companies to ensure its search engine is the default choice across the majority of the world’s smartphones and web browsers.Google said it would aggressively fight the claims, describing the landmark complaint as “dubious” and insisting that its exclusivity deals with manufacturers, telecoms companies and rival web browsers are all a normal part of business.

<div><p>The US Government has launched <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/23/us-launches-investigation-breaking-big-tech/">a landmark antitrust case against Google</a> which could trigger the break-up of the $1 trillion tech behemoth.</p>
<p>Officials at the Department of Justice (DoJ) accused the firm of building an illegal monopoly and dominating the internet, saying it pays tens of billions of dollars to the likes of Apple and Samsung so it is used as their phones' default search engine.</p>
<p>This allows Google to crush rivals and hammers choice for its customers, the DoJ claimed in its biggest trust-busting action for decades. The case is likely to drag on for years and could ultimately lead to multi-billion dollar fines or even an order to split the business, recalling the break-up of Standard Oil by trustbusters more than a century ago.</p>
<p>Prosecutors claimed that Google had &#8220;foreclosed competition for internet search&#8221; and that competitors are &#8220;denied vital distribution, scale, and product recognition&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>The charges - the most significant against a tech company since the Justice Department&#8217;s crusade against Bill Gates&#8217; Microsoft in the late 1990s - called for &#8220;structural relief&#8221; as a potential remedy to the company&#8217;s behaviour, a reference to forcing Google to sell off parts of its business.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&#8217;s lawsuit focused on so-called exclusionary agreements that which Google has reached with other tech companies to ensure its search engine is the default choice across the majority of the world&#8217;s smartphones and web browsers.</p>
<p>Google said it would aggressively fight the claims, describing the landmark complaint as &#8220;dubious&#8221; and insisting that its exclusivity deals with manufacturers, telecoms companies and rival web browsers are all a normal part of business.&#160;</p>

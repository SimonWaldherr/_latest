Shocking video shows the moment a stranger rushed up and pushed a Bronx dad onto subway tracks in Manhattan last month.

The clip released by the NYPD shows Raphael Mejias, 25, waiting for a southbound A train at Columbus Circle just after 5.30 a.m. on Sept. 24 when his attacker runs up behind him.

After shoving Mejias onto the track, the attacker in light-colored pants appears to pause a brief second to look — then hustle away.

The NYPD said the shover was not known to his victim, and “no words were exchanged prior to this unprovoked attack.”

Mejias was pulled to safety with the help of a Good Samaritan. He was taken to Mount Sinai hospital and “suffered scratches to the right arm and pain to the right leg and right rib cage,” the NYPD said.

The attacker appeared to be carrying a backpack and wearing a heavy hooded top.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).

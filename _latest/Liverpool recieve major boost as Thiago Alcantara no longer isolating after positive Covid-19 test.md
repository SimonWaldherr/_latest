Thiago Alcantara is no longer being forced to self-isolate after testing positive for coronavirus late last month.

The Liverpool midfielder contracted the virus and a statement was released by the Reds on September 29, whereby the club also explained that he was "exhibiting minor symptoms of the virus but was in good health and getting better".

Self-isolation guidelines in the UK indicate that after testing positive for Covid-19, you must self-isolate for at least 10 days.

It has now been 11 days after the initial statement about Thiago catching the virus and he has posted an update on social media with pictures of himself taking a walk around Liverpool city centre.

He was captured walking along both Seel Street and Brick Street.

Thiago was due to join up with Spain during the international break this month for their matches against Switzerland and Ukraine due to testing positive for coronavirus.

However, news that he has left isolation and is clearly no longer suffering with Covid-19 will be a huge boost for Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp.

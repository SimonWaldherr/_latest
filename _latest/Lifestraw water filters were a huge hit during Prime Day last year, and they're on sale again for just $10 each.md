The LifeStraw Personal Water Filter is nearly 50% off — matching its lowest price ever — for Amazon Prime Day 2020 until October 14. Last year, the company reportedly sold a whopping 200,000 units at the same low $10 price.

Whether you're focused on emergency preparations or going hiking, potable water is one of the most fundamental needs. And, in terms of simplicity and reliability, there are few products as useful for securing access to potable water as the LifeStraw Personal Water Filter.

The LifeStraw is essentially a straw — nine inches long and just over one inch wide — and weighs only two ounces. Its membrane microfilter removes 99.9 percent of bacteria, parasites, microplastics, and dirt, although it's not a purifier (which would also filter out any waterborne viruses). You should expect to filter 4,000 liters (or 1,000 gallons) of water before needing to replace this filter, too. In other words, it'll last you several years with regular use.

We've used the LifeStraw for everything from daytime hikes where the bulk and weight of a pump filter isn't ideal to weeks-long trips into Minnesota's Boundary Water Wilderness. On every occasion, its convenience has been invaluable.

Overall, we appreciate the straw's unmatched versatility and the fact the design is intuitive enough that it eliminates the risk of using it incorrectly, even for first-timers and kids. Plus, its $10 sale price means you can stock up — one for your backpack and one for your car for emergency situations.

It's worth noting that it does have a few drawbacks. First, it's not repairable if something goes wrong and the small size of the filter makes it tough to use for larger groups — it's also quite hard to store water once filtered. But used in the right situations, it's a vital addition to anyone's emergency kit or pack of outdoor gear.

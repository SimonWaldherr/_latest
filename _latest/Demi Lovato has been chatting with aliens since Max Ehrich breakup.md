  Why use ice cream and sad music to get over a breakup when you can talk to aliens instead?Demi Lovato, 28, shared on Instagram that she recently spent a few days in Joshua Tree with Dr. Steven Greer — “one of the world’s foremost authorities on the subject of UFOs, ET intelligence, and initiating peaceful contact with ET civilizations,” according to his Instagram bio — and a group of close friends to connect with aliens.She then told fans not to worry if it doesn’t work immediately.“(Ps, if it doesn’t happen on the first try – keep trying – it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact!)She didn’t reveal what she and the aliens conversed about, but we can only assume she caught them up on her dramatic last few months from ending her engagement to releasing a politically charged tune.

<div><p>Why use ice cream and sad music to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/09/24/demi-lovato-and-fiance-max-ehrich-are-heading-for-a-breakup/">get over a breakup</a> when you can talk to aliens instead?</p>
<p>Demi Lovato, 28, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGb6T3HBtch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared on Instagram</a> that she recently spent a few days in Joshua Tree with Dr. Steven Greer &#8212; &#8220;one of the world&#8217;s foremost authorities on the subject of UFOs, ET intelligence, and initiating peaceful contact with ET civilizations,&#8221; according to his Instagram bio &#8212; and a group of close friends to connect with aliens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I&#8217;ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me,&#8221; she captioned a series of photos and videos of UFOs in the night sky.</p>
<p>Lovato, along with Greer and his CE5 (Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind) team, are encouraging just one percent of the world&#8217;s population to &#8220;meditate and make contact&#8221; with aliens so that governments would have to &#8220;acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>The former Disney star then promoted Greer&#8217;s CE5 app, which costs $9.99, and is required to make contact with the otherworldly beings. She then told fans not to worry if it doesn&#8217;t work immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Ps, if it doesn&#8217;t happen on the first try &#8211; keep trying &#8211; it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact!) Happy communicating &#128158;&#128591;&#127996;&#8221; she ended her post.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t reveal what she and the aliens conversed about, but we can only assume she caught them up on her dramatic last few months from <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/09/24/demi-lovato-and-max-ehrich-reportedly-break-off-engagement/">ending her engagement</a> to releasing a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/2020-billboard-music-awards-sound-a-political-note-ahead-of-election/">politically charged tune</a>.</p>

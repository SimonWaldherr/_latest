If you're in the market for a new carry-on but aren't quite ready to shell out on a premium suitcase, the AmazonBasics Hardside Carry-On Spinner Suitcase is an excellent option. Named our best budget carry-on, the already affordable 21-inch bag is an extra 40% off for Amazon Prime Day 2020. Coming in at $32.99 thanks to the sale, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more affordable option that's still this sturdy and sleek.

That said, bear in mind that this bag is best for weekend vacationers who only take a few trips a year and the suitcase may not last several years if you're a frequent flier. But with an elegant exterior, smooth spinner wheels, and an adjustable handle that doesn't wobble, it will more than do the trick for casual travelers.

For those who are also seeking a checked bag, you can buy this carry-on and its matching checked suitcase as part of a set that's currently also on sale for 25% off its typical retail price of about $114.

Elegies (Radio 4, Sunday) offered a much more highbrow take on faith, doubt and poetry. In this two-part drama, Michael Symmons Roberts, himself a gifted poet, wove together the lives of Milton and Tennyson, imagining the stories behind their great elegies Lycidas and In Memoriam, both written in their twenties when they were students at Cambridge. In a curious decision, Roberts made Milton’s friend Charles Diodati into a kind of immortal time-traveller, allowing him to hang out with Tennyson two centuries later. It worked, just about.

Cutting between scenes of drama and excerpts from the poems (read very well by Strike star Holliday Grainger), was a neat way of giving us the subtext behind the poetry. For instance, a line about bad shepherds might sound innocuous to 21st-century readers, but to Milton’s father it was such an obvious attack on the 17th-century clergy that he feared his son was putting both their lives in danger: “They are torturing dissenters in the streets for less than this.”

In Sunday’s concluding episode, Grainger was particularly as good Tennyson’s sister Emily, fiancee of his close friend (and, perhaps, lover) Arthur Hallam; she felt the poet was trying to claim a greater share of grief for Hallam’s death, and bridled at this. It became a ghostly love-triangle. “I feel it, when I sorrow most;/ ‘Tis better to have loved and lost,/ than never to have loved at all” is an odd thing to write about someone else’s husband-to-be.

I admired Elegies, but at times in its two hours it felt too ponderous; I felt no sorrow at its departure. I preferred the ghostly goings-on in the 15-minute bursts of Rebecca and Jeremy Front’s mockumentary Incredible Women (Radio 4, Monday-Friday), which in this eighth series has become a delicious pre-Halloween bonbon of comedy-horror. Jeremy’s roving reporter is sent to interview a ghost debunker (Rebecca) living in a creepy old house. Things go bump in the night.

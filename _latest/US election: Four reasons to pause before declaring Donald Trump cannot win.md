<div><p>The 2020 election&#160;is not the&#160;2016 election. That is worth establishing from the off. Donald Trump is the incumbent. Bashing the status quo and running as an outsider when you are president is much harder.</p>
<p>Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton. He is viewed more favourably than she was before the least election. There are also fewer undecided voters and third party candidates are polling less than 2016.&#160;</p>
<p>All of these are reasons to believe that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/22/us-election-polls-2020-live-tracker-who-win-biden-trump/">the poll lead enjoyed by Mr Biden</a>, the Democratic presidential nominee, is firmer than the one Ms Clinton had before her defeat four years ago.</p>
<p>But with that said, this too must be pointed out: Mr Biden&#8217;s lead in the polls does not guarantee victory. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/22/presidential-debate-trump-vs-biden-2020-time-watch-uk-election/">The race is not done and dusted</a>. His win is not written in stone.</p>
<p>Mr Biden may well secure the landslide predicted by many. He may win by whisker. Or - still a possibility - Mr Trump, against the odds, could get a second term.</p>
<p>If the president does that there will be a slew of &#8220;the signs were always there&#8221; articles. Given this, perhaps it is worth dwelling on what those signs could be. Here are four of them.</p>

  What scientists hope to learn from a beetle that can survive being run over by a car 
description: > 
  It’s a beetle that can withstand bird pecks, animal stomps and even being rolled over by a Toyota Camry.Now scientists are studying what the bug’s crush-resistant shell could teach them about designing stronger airplanes and buildings.“This beetle is super tough,” said Purdue University civil engineer Pablo Zavattieri, who was among a group of researchers that ran over the insect with a car in the name of science.Other beetle species shattered under one-third as much pressure.AdvertisementThe beetle study is part of an $8-million project funded by the U.S. Air Force to explore how the biology of creatures such as mantis shrimp and bighorn sheep could help develop impact-resistant materials.

<div><p>It&#8217;s a beetle that can withstand bird pecks, animal stomps and even being rolled over by a Toyota Camry. Now scientists are studying what the bug&#8217;s crush-resistant shell could teach them about designing stronger airplanes and buildings.</p><p>&#8220;This beetle is super tough,&#8221; said Purdue University civil engineer <a class="link" href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~zavattie/" target="_blank">Pablo Zavattieri</a>, who was among a group of researchers that ran over the insect with a car in the name of science.</p><p>So, how does the seemingly indestructible insect do it? </p><p>The species &#8212; the aptly named diabolical ironclad beetle &#8212; owes its might to <a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2813-8" target="_blank">an unusual armor</a> that is layered and pieced together like a jigsaw, according to the study by Zavattieri and his colleagues published in Nature on Wednesday. Its design, they say, could help inspire more durable structures and vehicles.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p></p><p>To understand what gives the inch-long beetle its strength, researchers first tested how much squishing it could take. The species, which can be found in Southern California&#8217;s woodlands, withstood compression of about 39,000 times its own weight.</p><p>For a 200-pound man, that would be like surviving a 7.8-million-pound crush.</p><p>Other beetle species shattered under one-third as much pressure.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

    </p>
<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>Researchers then used electron microscopes and CT scans to examine the beetle&#8217;s exoskeleton and figure out what made it so strong.</p><p>As is often the case for flightless beetles, the species&#8217; elytra &#8212; the protective case that normally sheaths wings &#8212; had strengthened and toughened over time. Up close , scientists realized this cover also benefited from special, jigsaw-like bindings and a layered architecture.</p>

<p>When compressed, they found the structure fractured slowly instead of snapping all at once.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>&#8220;When you pull them apart,&#8221; Zavattieri said, &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t break catastrophically. It just deforms a little bit. That&#8217;s crucial for the beetle.&#8221;</p><p>It could also be useful for engineers who design vehicles, including aircraft, and buildings with a variety of materials such as steel, plastic and plaster. Currently, engineers rely on pins, bolts, welding and adhesives to hold everything together. But those techniques can be prone to degrading.</p><p>In the structure of the beetle&#8217;s shell, nature offers an &#8220;interesting and elegant&#8221; alternative, Zavattieri said.</p><p>Because the beetle-inspired design fractures in a gradual and predictable way, cracks could be more reliably inspected for safety, said <a class="link" href="http://mse.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/412-1298-16875.php?Lang=en" target="_blank">Po-Yu Chen</a>, an engineer at Taiwan&#8217;s National Tsing Hua University who wrote <a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02840-1" target="_blank">a commentary</a> about the work.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Velcro, for example, was inspired by the hook-like structure of plant burrs.

(CNN) The cast of "30 Rock" got back together on Thursday night, but unlike some of the higher-minded reunions mounted during the coronavirus pandemic, the stunt had an overt commercial motivation to it -- serving as an infomercial for all things NBC and its new streaming service, Peacock.

Yes, the whole cast appeared -- under the guise of being recruited to do a reboot of the show within the show.

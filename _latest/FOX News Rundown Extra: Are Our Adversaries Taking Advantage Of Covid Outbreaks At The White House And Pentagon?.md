President Trump was not the only high-ranking government official sidelined by the coronavirus this week. Multiple people at both the White House and the Pentagon were either diagnosed or forced to quarantine because of outbursts at both institutions.

Earlier this week on the FOX News Rundown, host Lisa Brady spoke with National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien about the recent coronavirus outbreaks in our government and how our adversaries might react.

Besides assuring Americans that the our leaders are utilizing contingency plans and remained prepared for threats, he also weighed in on how they're continuing to keep their focus on combatting terrorism, drug trafficking and election interference.

The original interview was too long and we could not include it all of it in our segment. On The FOX NEWS Rundown you will hear our full conversation with National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien and learn even more about how our government is remaining vigilant despite the covid outbreaks. He also discusses how he took part in an event to honor Arizona aid worker Kayla Mueller who was kidnapped and killed by Islamic State militants.

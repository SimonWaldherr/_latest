description: > 
  Shaughna Phillips blocked the word ‘legs’ from showing up on her social feed before she went into the Love Island villa earlier this year.It’s because she had fat cells building up in her legs which made them bigger.It’s only since leaving the villa that Shaughna has been diagnosed with stage one lipoedema.It’s thought over one in 10 women in the UK have the condition, which is an abnormal build-up of fat cells that can’t be broken down by diet or exercise.Shaughna decided to pay for private liposuction to shrink her legs.

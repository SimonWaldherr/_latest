<div><p>About 500 acres of forest land in Monterey County near Big Sur had burned by Monday afternoon in what officials are calling the Coleman fire.</p><p>Andrew Madsen, a Los Padres National Forest spokesman, said no structures are at risk. The fire is at 0% containment.</p><p>When the fire began is a bit of a mystery, Madsen said, adding that  it may have started as early as Thursday. The Cal Fire <a class="link" href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/10/18/coleman-fire/" target="_blank">website lists the start date as Sunday</a>.</p><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t receive information on when the fire stated as is usually the case, but we know it&#8217;s in the forest and not far off from [U.S. Army garrison] Ft. Hunter Liggett,&#8221; Madsen said.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Fort personnel tweeted Sunday that there &#8220;is no danger&#8221; to the installation, but that voluntary evacuations orders were in effect for nearby canyons.</p><p>If there&#8217;s a positive in terms of containment efforts, it&#8217;s that local, state and federal firefighters were already in position to fight the Coleman fire. <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-09/firefighters-injured-in-dolan-fire" target="_blank">The nearby Dolan fire</a>, which started Aug. 19 and has burned about 125,000 acres, is 98% contained, <a class="link" href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/" target="_blank">according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection</a>.</p><p>There were, at one time, 249 firefighters and 16 engines assigned to battle the Dolan fire.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

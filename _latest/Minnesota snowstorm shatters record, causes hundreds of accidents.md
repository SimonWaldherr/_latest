<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office for the Twin Cities said that 7.9 inches of snow fell at Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport, which broke a previous daily record of three inches set back on Oct. 20, 1916.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had record-breaking snow, snow totals here across the Northern Rockies, the Northern Plains, the Upper Midwest, Minnesota receiving over 8 inches of snow and another batch of snow is on the way,&#8221; Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean said on &#8220;Fox &amp; Friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storm was also the second-largest October snowstorm on record.</p>
<p>Across the Twin Cities, there was a swath of 4 to 6 inches of snowfall, which made roadways slick.</p>
<p>The Minnesota State Patrol said that troopers responded to a number of crashes, spinouts, and vehicles off the road in central Minnesota, especially along Interstate 94.</p>
<p>State Patrol said that troopers responded to 493 crashes statewide from 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Some 48 of those crashes involved injuries, including one serious injury. No fatalities were reported.</p>
<p>In addition to the crashes, troopers also responded to 614 vehicle spinouts and 22 semi-trucks that jackknifed on area roadways.</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz took to Twitter to urge motorists to drive safe and &#8220;take care of yourselves and neighbors.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Minnesotans are ready for winter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When it snows we usually just build snowmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The early season snowstorm caused closures across the area. In Minneapolis, the city&#8217;s absentee ballot drop off locations closed early at 3 p.m. so election workers and voters could get home safe, <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/state-patrol-reports-493-crashes-614-spinouts-as-fall-snowstorm-hits-minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FOX9 reported.</a></p>
<p>The storm also caused power outages throughout the region.</p>
<p>Xcel Energy told FOX9 about 8,000 customers in the Twin Cities metro area were without power late Tuesday. At the peak, about 33,500 customers were impacted by the outage.</p>
<p>More snow to come</p>
<p>Record-breaking snowfall will continue over the Rockies into the Northern Plains and through the Upper Midwest from Wednesday into Thursday.</p>
<p>Some areas could receive over 8 inches of new snow where <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/winter-storm-warning-weather-advisory-difference-forecast-advisory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winter storm watches</a> have been posted.</p>
<p>Expect difficult travel with poor visibility in these regions as gusty winds over 35 mph and a widespread area of 6 to 12 inches of new snow will fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;This snow could actually go into the foot or more range,&#8221; Dean said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The cold air setting the stage for all this snow will plunge as far south as Texas on Friday.</p>
<p>Showers and thunderstorms will bring heavy rain at times over the Great Lakes and Mid-Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>Widespread showers and thunderstorms are also moving into South Florida with heavy rain and the risk of flash flooding.</p>

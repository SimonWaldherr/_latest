Skincare is surging in popularity across social-media platforms and brands are working with "skinfluencers" to promote their products.

Young Yuh, known as yayayayoung, is a TikTok influencer with over 1 million followers. His account took off earlier in 2020 after he first started posting in March.

Skincare has become a new quarantine obsession for many who turn to social-media platforms, especially TikTok, to learn about new products, routines, and ways to treat their skin.

But influencer Young Yuh's skincare journey started well before 2020.

"When I was in sixth or seventh grade, I had gnarly acne on my forehead," Yuh, the face behind the viral TikTok account "yayayayoung," told Business Insider.

And when all the tricks he had been trying on his own didn't work, he forced his mother to take him to a dermatologist.

"The dermatologist did this crazy procedure where she got this like, metal scraper and she scraped it along my forehead," he said. The doctor put a cream on his skin and prescribed him a four-day skincare set. Within days, his acne disappeared.

"I was like, what is this?" Yuh said. "What is this sorcery?" Ever since, Yuh had been intrigued by skincare.

"I will skip meals just to do my skincare," he joked.

In 2017, Yuh started his social-media career by doing product reviews and sharing his routines on Instagram and YouTube. But his popularity snowballed with the rise of TikTok, where he has over 1 million followers.

He posted his first TikTok in March and quickly started gaining traction. His first few videos were getting thousands of views, and within a month, they were getting nearly half a million, Yuh said.

Yuh is part of a surge in skincare content across social media, a category which saw a 197% increase in engagements between the first half of 2019 and the first half of 2020, according to data from Traackr, an influencer-marketing platform.

TikTok, in particular, has given rise to a new type of skincare influencer focused on affordability and the non-glamorous side of beauty. On TikTok, #skincare has nearly 20 billion views.

While many skincare influencers were focusing on Instagram and creating "aesthetically pleasing photoshoots," Yuh went a different direction, he said. His TikTok content is centered around comedy and accessibility â€” a notion that skincare can be fun, instead of intimidating.

"While it's fun, I want to educate you on something, and maybe take one little point about skincare that you'll remember," he said.

In May, skincare brands started reaching out to Yuh for potential partnerships on TikTok, he said.

"At that time, no one really knew what the requirements were," he said. "They didn't know how to approach the pay rate. You can't approach TikTok like Instagram. Instagram is consistent." On TikTok, view counts can vary wildly depending on whether a particular video is favored by the app's algorithm.

Because of this, negotiating TikTok brand deals takes more work than Instagram collaborations, Yuh said.

After researching on Craigslist and Indeed about how much money videographers and production assistants make hourly, he calculated his starting rates for his content: between $1,000 and $3,000. For a more educational TikTok video, it takes Yuh about five to six hours, including scripting, filming, and editing takes, he said.

But for his more comedic sketches, like his recent TikTok of him crying in the shower over St. Ives (a contentious but very popular skincare brand), those usually only take an hour, he said.

Yuh estimated that 70% of his brand partnerships are now on TikTok and 30% on Instagram. He also uses a few affiliate marketing programs, including Amazon and The Ordinary.

Yuh sat down with Business Insider over a video call to talk about his daily routines as a "skinfluencer," from waking up and washing his face, to spending several hours each day responding to emails from brands and filming content.

8:00 a.m.

Wake up. Coffee. Skincare.

I wake up in the morning and I have my coffee or tea. I always have my coffee and then I start doing my skincare.

If I have a very specific skincare routine in mind for the morning, then I'll do my skincare routine and in the middle, when I'm doing some type of mask, that's when I'll drink my coffee or my tea, because you've got to save time somehow.

Here's a breakdown of Yuh's morning skincare routine:

1. Cleanse with a cleansing foam (and "pat, pat" dry)

2. Quick exfoliation with a bubble mask and rinse

3. Apply toner

4. Apply essence for hydration

5. Serum (either Vitamin B5, Vitamin C, or hyaluronic acid)

6. Sheet mask to "push that hydration in"

7. Eye cream

8. Moisturizer (and if he's wearing makeup that day, he'll apply a gel moisturizer)

9. And lastly, sunscreen

9:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m.

Answering emails, scripting out upcoming videos for the day and week, and editing.

After that is going full-blown into emails. I open my email and there's like 50 emails and I have to go through all of them. Most creators don't do this, but even brands that I'm not interested in at that time or brands that I don't have time for right now because I have so many products, I actually respond back to every one of them.

During that time, I'm writing out scripts, I'm preparing like, 'Oh, tomorrow, maybe I can add this in.' Or I'll revise other videos, so I'll reshoot or re-edit. A lot of that core time is prepping. From the morning until dinner, I'm just going back and forth with brands and then prepping a lot of stuff.

3:00 p.m.

Late lunch or an early dinner.

Once I knock out all of my emails, that's when I'll eat something.

(Yuh also practices intermittent fasting)

4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.

Yuh calls his girlfriend for a midday phone call.

5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.

Filming, editing, and streaming on Twitch.

Then, finally, at nighttime is when I actually get to edit or film.

I always try to film during the nighttime, which is why I have all these lights and stuff like that. Because first of all, I can control the lighting a lot better, and second, it makes editing far easier not only for color grading, but the actual lighting. The exposure is very difficult to control with natural lighting, unless there are absolutely no clouds, but where I'm at, there's always clouds. So a majority of the time I film around six or seven.

Yuh also started streaming on Twitch recently, which he blocks out time for at night. And if he ever gets a quick break during his day, he'll sometimes play a video game to unwind.

11 p.m. to 12 a.m.

Yuh ends his day with a shower and his nighttime routine.

Here's a summary of Yuh's nighttime routine:

1. Cleansing balm

2. Cleansing foam and rinse

3. Exfoliate or apply a clay mask

4. Cleansing stick for blackhead removal

5. Towel dry, apply toner, and then essence

6. Serum (Vitamin C)

7. Hydration spray and then a sheet mask for extra hydration

8. LED light therapy on "problem areas"

9. Eye cream and moisturizer, or a sleeping mask

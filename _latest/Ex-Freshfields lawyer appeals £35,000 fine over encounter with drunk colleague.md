  Ex-Freshfields lawyer appeals £35,000 fine over encounter with drunk colleague 
description: > 
  A former partner at City law firm Freshfields, who was fined over a sexual encounter with a junior female colleague in 2016, was “caught on the shifting sands of attitudes towards sexual behaviour”, his lawyers told at a court hearing on Tuesday.Ryan Beckwith was fined £35,000 and ordered to pay £200,000 in costs by the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal last year for breaching his professional duties and is appealing the sanctions against him in the High Court.The case is one of a series of high profile incidents of alleged sexual misconduct in the City, which is undergoing a shift in working culture in the wake of the Me Too movement.Alisdair Williamson QC told the High Court that Mr Beckwith had a “temporary lapse” of judgment rather than committing persistent, unwanted behaviour, the Law Society Gazette reported.Mr Wiliamson argued that sanctioning Mr Beckwith for consensual sexual activity was an “unforeseeable intrusion into solicitors’ private lives”.

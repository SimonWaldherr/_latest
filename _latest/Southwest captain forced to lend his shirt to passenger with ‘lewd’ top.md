A Southwest Airlines passenger said she was prevented from boarding her flight because her breasts were deemed “lewd, obscene and offensive” — forcing the captain to lend her his T-shirt.

Irate Chicago resident Kayla Eubanks took to Twitter to document her dispute on Tuesday with ground staffers who said her low-cut black halter top was too revealing.

“Y’all I was KICKED OFF my @SouthwestAir flight because my boobs are ‘lewd, obscene and offensive.’ I was told that passengers may look at me in my attire and be offended,” Eubanks tweeted along with a bathroom selfie showing her ensemble, which included a long red skirt.

“I really wanna know why @SouthwestAir is policing my clothes like this,” she said in another tweet. “How will my shirt impact my flight, for myself, the other passengers or even the pilot?

“Y’all have a dress code for CUSTOMERS who pay to get on a plane? It’s the constant policing of women’s bodies for me,” she added.

In another post, Eubanks shared video she took of an employee searching for Southwest’s dress code policy just minutes before departure time, saying the staffer “practically did cartwheels to ensure that I wouldn’t get on this plane y’all. I was held at the gate for 30 minutes because of my shirt.”

“If it’s there, why can’t y’all find it?” Eubanks asks the employee about the policy. “If it’s there, why don’t y’all know it?”

She then recorded the captain, who had just come out of the bathroom at the gate, walk over to her after being summoned by the employee.

“They’re hating on you because you’re looking good, is that right?” the captain says to Eubanks.

“If they’re like, ‘Hey, the rule says you have to cover up,’ do you have something?” he asks, clearly uneasy about the conversation. “Do you have a shirt or do you want me to give you one of mine?”

Eubanks replies that she wants to see the policy first — and as the captain walks off to try to resolve the matter, she says: “I have to leave my t—–s at home? Obviously not,” as he chuckles.

“The CAPTAIN of the flight loaned me his shirt so that I could board (having been removed from the flight and the flight being delayed). I eventually took it off.. Only to be told that I would have to speak with a supervisor upon landing,” she wrote in a tweet showing her seated with a “Boys of Summer” baseball T-shirt.

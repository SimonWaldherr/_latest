<p>NASA is about to attempt to collect its first sample of an asteroid.</p><p>The mission involves commanding a spacecraft 200 million miles away, instructing it to descend to the surface of a space rock called Bennu. Within just five to 10 seconds, the probe should collect samples from the asteroid's surface, then turn around and eventually fly them back to Earth.</p><p>OSIRIS-REx, as the spacecraft is known (short for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer), is set to attempt this "touch-and-go" operation on Tuesday at 6:12 p.m. ET.&#160;</p><p>The spacecraft has been orbiting Bennu since December 2018, scanning the asteroid and collecting as much data as possible. It's set to leave in March 2021, samples in tow, then reach Earth on September 24, 2023.</p>

<p>OSIRIS-REx's research could be crucial over the next 100 years, since Bennu's path puts it at risk of crashing into Earth.</p><p>"Bennu is one of the most potentially hazardous asteroids, with a non-negligible chance of impacting the Earth at some point in the 22nd century," Dante Lauretta, the mission's principal investigator, said in September. "Part of our science investigation is about understanding its orbital trajectory, refining the impact probability, and documenting its physical and chemical properties so that future generations can develop an impact-mitigation mission, if that's necessary."</p><p>There are other important reasons to study Bennu, too: As new missions go deeper into space, they will need to make pit stops to mine asteroids for resources like water, which can be split into oxygen and hydrogen for rocket fuel. The data NASA is gathering from Bennu could help inform such asteroid mining attempts in the future.</p><p>

</p><p>OSIRIS-REx is also, in a sense, a soul-searching mission. Asteroids are bits of ancient rock from the beginnings of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. The leftover material that made the rocky planets &#8212; Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars &#8212; coalesced over time into asteroids, where it's largely preserved in its original form.</p>

<p>Some theories posit that asteroids delivered key ingredients for life to ancient Earth. On Bennu, scientists may find signs of those ingredients, cluing them in to how life arose on Earth (and possibly on Mars or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/venus-clouds-phosphine-gas-microbes-alien-life-2020-9">Venus</a> as well).&#160;</p><p>If successful, this mission will be one of the first to return samples of primordial rock. Japan's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/japan-lands-spacecraft-on-ryugu-asteroid-2019-7">Hayabusa-2 spacecraft</a> is also set to bring back asteroid samples in December.</p><p>"This is all about understanding our origins, addressing some of the most fundamental questions that we ask ourselves as human beings: Where did we come from? And are we alone in the universe?" Lauretta said.</p><h2>NASA's spacecraft should drop 3,000 feet and blast asteroid dust</h2><p>OSIRIS-REx's data since 2018 revealed a problem for the mission: Bennu is much rockier that NASA thought. Landing in a field of boulders puts a spacecraft at risk of tipping over and getting stranded.&#160;</p><p>

</p><p>To target the smoothest possible terrain on the asteroid, the landing spot the OSIRIS-REx mission team chose is much smaller than originally planned. Its leeway is just 26 feet (8 meters), whereas the initial plan expected it to have 164 feet (50 meters). That means the spacecraft, which is about the size of a 15-passenger van, must target an area roughly equal to six parking spaces on the rotating asteroid.</p>

<p id="gpt-post-science-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-4" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p>The landing spot is a relatively smooth area named Nightingale, which is covered in a fine rocky dust called regolith. This is the material that OSIRIS-REx will attempt to scoop up and bring back to Earth.</p><p>On Tuesday, the spacecraft is expected to plunge about 3,280 feet (1 kilometer), maneuvering past a two-story-tall boulder that mission controllers call "Mount Doom." OSIRIS-REx has already rehearsed this descent twice, practicing "basically everything except for the final two minutes," according to project manager Mike Moreau.</p><p>

</p><p>The sequence should go like this: The spacecraft's thrusters will fire, pushing it out of its kilometer-high orbit above Bennu, and then the probe will deploy its sample-collection arm and point its navigation camera to the asteroid's surface. About 3.5 hours later &#8212; and about 410 feet (125 meters) above the surface &#8212; the spacecraft will fire its thrusters again to push itself towards the landing site. After another 10 minutes and another 260 feet of descent, the spacecraft will burn its thrusters to maneuver into a precise landing spot.</p><p>If the spacecraft's instruments detect a rocky field that's unsafe for landing, the probe will initiate a back-away burn just 16 feet (5 meters) above the surface.</p>

<p>But if the spacecraft successfully reaches Bennu's surface with its sample-collection arm stretched down, it will then shoot nitrogen gas out of a bottle to stir up the regolith. In the disturbance, some material should get caught in the collection tool at the end of the arm.</p><p>

</p><p>Then OSIRIS-REx will fire its thrusters to push itself away from Bennu.</p><h2>NASA will decide whether to stow the sample or try again</h2><p>Once the spacecraft is back in Bennu's orbit, it will take a few days for NASA mission controllers to analyze the regolith sample it collected. If there's enough rock and dust, mission leaders will command the spacecraft to store the sample in a pod for its return to Earth.</p><p>

</p><p>However, if anything goes wrong during the operation &#8212; the spacecraft has to back away, its collection arm can't reach the surface, or it collects less than 60 grams of regolith &#8212; OSIRIS-REx will try again in January, targeting a back-up site on a different part of the asteroid.</p>

<p>"By far the most likely outcome that we will have on October 20 is we will contact the surface and come away with a large sample that exceeds our minimum requirements," Moreau said in the briefing. "But Bennu has thrown us a number of curveballs."</p><p>OSIRIS-REx is carrying three bottles of nitrogen for stirring up dust, allowing it three attempts to descend to Bennu's surface and collect a proper sample.</p><h2>The Bennu sample should reach Earth in 2023</h2><p>When OSIRIS-REx eventually returns to Earth in 2023, it should eject the capsule containing the samples, which would then reenter Earth's atmosphere and parachute to the ground.</p><p>"It's going to probably be Christmas in September," Lauretta said. "The best Christmas present I've ever had, these pristine samples from asteroid Bennu that I've been dreaming &#8212; literally dreaming about for, at that point, almost 20 years of my life."</p><p>

<p>"These samples returned from Bennu will also allow future planetary scientists to ask questions we can't even think of today," Lori Glaze, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, said, "and to be able to use analysis techniques that aren't even invented yet."</p>

With images of popular plants such as Monstera deliciosa (Swiss cheese plant), varieties of Alocasia (elephant’s ear) and Calathea (prayer plant) constantly available on social media, it is no surprise that the RHS found that these varieties were also the bestselling houseplants in 2019.

Sales of Alocasia, particularly the dramatic Alocasia zebrina, grew tenfold over the previous year’s figure, while their Wisley Plant Centre sold over 1,300 prayer plants. Many traditional garden centres have been slow to ­promote indoor plant sales. Instead, the main growth has been through online sites such as Hortology and Patch, as well as specialist shops such as Conservatory Archives in Hackney, east London.

In 2018, Patch sent out 120,000 houseplants to British homes. During the lockdown, they’ve already sent out 31,000 of one plant alone, ‘Rapunzel’, Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum). Sales of ‘Susie’, a Sansevieria, and ‘Big Ken’, the kentia palm, have also dramatically increased. (All Patch’s plants come with reassuring non-botanical names, so as not to scare beginners.)

Most of these newly-popular plants have actually been around for over 150 years. They are being rediscovered by a new generation because they fit so well into contemporary lifestyles. There are other benefits as well. “The theme of wellbeing and indoor plants has been long-established,” Mark McCance, owner of online houseplant retailer, Hortology, told me. He thinks the Covid-19 pandemic has brought this into sharp focus, with people looking to create their personal sanctuary of calm.

Morris believes the love of plants has skipped a generation to the millennials and Generation Z. They may no longer have windowsills lined with African violets (Saintpaulia) as their grandparents did, but many spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum ‘Variegatum’) and Christmas cacti (Schlumbergera) have survived as cuttings passed on by family and friends.

I, too, am a borderline indoor plant addict (according to my husband). I think the total number – 35 – is quite modest, but I have to admit that many of them are rather large. I was seduced by an Alocasia zebrina, with its alluring striped stems when it was just 40cm high. Buyers beware! It has grown so big I could now hide behind its enormous statement leaves. But it’s staying because it’s still stylish.

A new introduction perhaps? Far from it. The illustration of Alocasia zebrina on the cover of the revised edition of Potted History is a hand-coloured print from the mid-19th century. There’s not much new under the sun these days – especially on the windowsill.

Popular plants that help clear the air at home

Thirty years ago, research from Nasa showed that certain houseplants could soak up air pollutants such as formaldehyde and benzene. Step forward Spathiphyllum wallisii, the peace lily. For best effect, you need lots of plants – ideally a green wall. But even just a few of these easy houseplants can improve indoor air quality.

Hedera helix, the common ivy, ties with Spathiphyllum in being best at reducing CO2 and stabilising humidity.

These are also proven to be beneficial to indoor air quality:

Dracaena fragrans ‘Lemon Lime’ Ficus elastica, the rubber plant

Guzmania ‘Indian Night’, colourful

Nephrolepis exaltata ‘Bostoniensis’, the Boston fern

Phoenix roebelenii, the dwarf date palm

Zamioculcas zamiifolia, the ZZ plant

Some houseplants are toxic to cats and dogs, so check labels carefully before purchasing.

How old is your houseplant?

Many popular houseplants have been around for over a 100 years.

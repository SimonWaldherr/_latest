<div><p>Odell Beckham Jr. apparently doesn&#8217;t believe COVID-19 can cover him or bring him down.</p>
<p>The former Giants star <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/odell-beckhams-covid-19-test-is-negative-after-illness-worry/">was sent home with an illness on Thursday of last week</a>, but he played in the Cleveland Browns&#8217; 38-7 loss Sunday to Pittsburgh after his coronavirus test came back negative.</p>
<p>OBJ said Wednesday that he never was concerned that he&#8217;d test positive or contract the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not in an arrogant way, I just don&#8217;t think COVID can get to me. I don&#8217;t it&#8217;s gonna enter this body,&#8221; Beckham said Wednesday. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want no parts of it; it don&#8217;t want no parts of me. I think it&#8217;s a mutual respect.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I wasn&#8217;t really worried about the test, it was just more in my mind for me and my maturity level I felt like it was the right thing to do to mention I may not have been feeling well. I just wouldn&#8217;t want it to spread throughout the whole building, if there was a case that I would have possibly had it. I was just trying to be an adult and be precautious about the situation and try and handle it the right way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beckham, 27, added that he and the Browns will continue to take the recommended steps to combat the virus that already has caused several postponements around the league.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;The s&#8211;t sucks, but that&#8217;s just what we have set up for this year,&#8221; Beckham said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what they seemed to have voted on and did all these phone calls and everything to come up with whatever the game plan is going to be. So like Coach (Kevin Stefanski) said, just embrace this stuff. It is what it is. It&#8217;s just part of the 2020 season.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three-time Pro Bowler <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/odell-beckham-had-sideline-meltdown-during-browns-blowout-loss/">lost his cool on the sidelines</a> after being removed from Sunday&#8217;s blowout loss along with banged-up quarterback Baker Mayfield and other starters in the fourth quarter. Beckham had to be calmed down by one of Cleveland&#8217;s assistant coaches after slamming down his helmet, hitting a Gatorade cooler and removing his cleats and gloves.</p>

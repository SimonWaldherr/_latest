</p><p><strong>Florida&#8217;s top election official is facing accusations of voter suppression after two last-minute moves critics say will lead to intimidation and confusion.</strong></p>
<p>Alarm bells went off last week after the office of Florida&#8217;s secretary of state, Laurel Lee, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/10/15/florida-acts-to-remove-felons-from-voter-rolls-as-election-looms-1325582" class="u-underline">abruptly notified</a> election officials the state was beginning to flag voters for potential removal from the voter rolls if they owed money related to a felony conviction. In a <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/elections/2020/10/16/late-guidance-from-floridas-elections-chief-could-limit-use-of-mail-ballot-drop-boxes/" class="u-underline">second letter</a>, the state offered an extremely restrictive view on how localities needed to operate ballot drop boxes, which voters are increasingly turning to this year amid United States Postal Service delays.</p>
<p>Both notices threaten confusion and chaos in one of the most important swing states in the 2020 election. Mail-in voting started weeks ago and in-person early voting started on Monday. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/19/us-election-polls-tracker-who-is-leading-in-the-swing-states" class="u-underline">Polls show</a> an extremely tight race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in Florida, a state where elections are routinely decided by just thousands of votes.</p>

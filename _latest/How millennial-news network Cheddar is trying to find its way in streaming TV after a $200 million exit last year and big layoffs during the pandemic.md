<p>In April, Dexter Goei, the CEO of Altice USA, and Jon Steinberg, the founder of Cheddar, virtually addressed a crowd of curious and apprehensive Cheddar employees.</p><p>This was a rare joint appearance by the millennial-news network's two leaders since Altice acquired Cheddar for $200 million in 2019. Altice execs, who worked out of the company's headquarters in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, had rarely visited Cheddar's State Street campus in lower Manhattan.</p><p>Now, with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-media-upstarts-rush-to-cut-costs-as-coronavirus-wipes-out-advertising-11586362288">layoffs sweeping across</a> the media sphere and everyone working remotely because of the pandemic, staffers scrambled to log in to Microsoft Teams for the Altice-hosted videoconference. (The Cheddar team still used Slack, a holdover from its independent days.)</p><p>Five former Cheddar staffers told Business Insider that they left the call feeling somewhat reassured about the state of the business during the pandemic, despite hearing the executives use words like "consolidation." They requested anonymity to protect future career prospects.</p><p>Steinberg, whom insiders have described as charismatic, relatable, and always looking to the next big thing, focused on the positives.</p><p>"They went through slides showing how great viewership was doing across the platform because of COVID," one of the people said. "There was no language in that to indicate that there would be mass layoffs."</p><p>The calls came an hour or two later. Staffers across the newsroom were laid off and furloughed, including Cheddar's entire Los Angeles bureau and producers and anchors who worked on long-running shows like "Opening Bell" and "Closing Bell." The cuts were across Altice.</p><p>Three sources estimated that Cheddar's staff was slashed by 30% or more, which would be a substantial share of the once growing operation. Altice said Cheddar now had 160 newsroom employees but declined to confirm the scope of the layoffs.</p>

<p>Multiple Cheddar insiders said they were stunned by the layoffs, with one describing them as a "horrible shock" and another saying they "came out of nowhere." Layoffs are common after mergers as companies eliminate staffers doing the same jobs &#8212; but these, more influenced by the pandemic, caught staffers off guard.</p><p>The meeting drew a sharp line from the old Cheddar, the startup where Steinberg, who calls Cheddar his "baby," shared key financials and ad-sales figures in weekly town halls, the former staffers said.</p><p>Cheddar isn't a startup anymore. It's part of Altice, which has become the US's fourth-largest cable operator since being spun out of a European telecom giant.</p><p>"It makes me feel terrible that people were caught blindsided," Steinberg told Business Insider of the layoffs. "I had hoped I never would do a layoff, but I think we handled it with decency."</p><p>The abrupt layoffs also dashed the hopes of some Cheddar employees that the backing of a cable giant would give financial breathing room to a company that had been forced to nearly constantly reinvent its business model since its founding.</p><p>Cheddar made a splashy entry into the media scene in the spring of 2016, when Steinberg, a former president of BuzzFeed and venture capitalist, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jon-steinberg-launches-cheddar-tv-2016-2">raised nearly $3 million in financing</a> to launch a CNBC for millennials. Steinberg was courting a crowd of young professionals interested in business news via connected TVs or their smartphones, rather than the traditional TV that increasingly reached an older demographic.</p><p>Cheddar was to be <a href="https://medium.com/@jonsteinberg/post-cable-networks-529ceba6913a">the "post-cable network,"</a> a phrase coined by Steinberg. He knew the key for a niche network like Cheddar would be landing distribution on every platform possible, from Twitter to gas-station TVs. But what he couldn't foresee was the series of fits and starts in the industry.</p><p>The Altice acquisition was a successful exit at a time when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-raised-money-at-a-sky-high-valuation-now-the-bill-is-coming-due-11581450643">other new-media outfits like Vice were struggling</a> and a lifeline for Cheddar after spending much of its four-year history chasing monetization &#8212; first on platforms like Facebook, then on streaming pay-TV providers like Sling TV, and recently on free ad-supported streaming-TV services like Pluto TV and Samsung TV Plus.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of the stages Cheddar has gone through as it chased distribution:</p><ul><li>Before Cheddar launched, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jon-steinberg-launches-cheddar-tv-2016-2">Steinberg said</a> he hoped to bypass traditional pre-roll and post-roll ads and generate revenue mainly from distribution deals with streaming services like Netflix.</li><li>Cheddar got its start in 2016 streaming on Facebook Live and posting clips on ad-supported websites like YouTube.</li><li>In May 2016, Cheddar introduced a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cheddar-the-cnbc-for-millennials-goes-behind-a-paywall-1462728602">$7-a-month subscription service</a> powered by Vimeo. It was later shuttered.</li><li>That year, Cheddar embraced advertising as it sought distribution on streaming pay-TV services like Sling TV, without the carriage fees that sustain legacy networks.</li><li>When the streaming pay-TV services struggled, Cheddar jumped into traditional TV, landing a carriage deal with the cable operator Spectrum before agreeing to sell to Altice. The deal closed in June 2019.</li><li>Recently, it has also focused on free ad-supported streaming-TV platforms like Pluto TV and Samsung TV Plus.</li></ul><p>Despite the acquisition, Cheddar has yet to find a stable model. And after the mass layoffs and Cheddar's shuttering of its second network, some insiders questioned how much Altice was willing to invest to make the millennial-news network a household name as it leans on Steinberg and other Cheddar leaders to build out its other news and ad businesses.</p><p>Steinberg, the president of Altice's 500-person news-and-advertising division, painted a rosy picture of the future. He said that in five years there would be no difference between a cable-news network like CNN or CNBC and a digital network like Cheddar.</p><p>"Cheddar has as good a shot at being a mainstay quote-unquote 'cable-news network' as any of the incumbents five years out," Steinberg said. "There will literally be very few advantages that a traditional cable-news network has relative to a new entrant in five years when the landscape and distribution is basically all mushed together."</p><p>But while Altice's news-and-advertising segment that includes Cheddar remained steady during the first half of 2020 &#8212; a feat during the pandemic &#8212; it also hasn't grown meaningfully since the Cheddar deal.</p><p>Roughly 16 months into the merger, Business Insider spoke with Steinberg, seven former Cheddar employees, and analysts about the future of Cheddar's "post-cable-network" strategy within Altice. The people described a scrappy operation that has molded itself to every potential avenue of distribution but whose path forward still faces hurdles beyond the company's control.</p><h2><strong>Cheddar has been in a nearly constant state of reinvention in its 4 years</strong></h2><p>After Cheddar was acquired, insiders said, little changed day-to-day, apart from the more layered expense-reimbursement and other administrative processes that come with being part of a large company.</p>

<p>Steinberg still led the weekly all-hands meetings, usually in jeans and a casual blazer. There were occasionally longer gaps between meetings as Steinberg's broader role pulled him away from Cheddar's offices. A few Altice employees from other news ventures were integrated into the Cheddar staff.</p><p>"Jon was really focused on making it feel like there weren't going to be changes," said Carlo DiMarco, an executive vice president and general manager of Cheddar's network on college campuses, CheddarU, who left two months after the acquisition closed.</p><p>"He was hypervigilant to make sure he didn't lose that magic in a bottle that Cheddar had ... the spirit of the company where everybody had a voice and could make a difference," DiMarco said.</p><p>

</p><p>All this added to the impression that it was business as usual at Cheddar, despite what other insiders said was a huge unknown in the influence Altice wielded over the company.</p><p>But there were signs that the Altice deal had been a reality check for Cheddar on how much its business model could sustain. A healthy skepticism has surrounded post-cable models that rely solely on ad dollars, as fragmented distribution makes it hard to measure their audiences. Altice <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190430005885/en/Altice-USA-to-Acquire-Cheddar">said</a> at the time of the acquisition that Cheddar reached roughly 40 million pay-TV homes and garnered 400 million video views a month &#8212; not quite an apples-to-apples comparison to the industry standard, TV ratings from Nielsen.</p><p>In June, after the layoffs at Cheddar, the company collapsed its two channels &#8212; one for business news and the other for general news &#8212; and <a href="https://news.cheddar.com/cheddar-2-0-513b90c41cc">rebranded as a single network</a>. Cheddar had been broadcasting the same feed to both networks since mid-March, a stopgap as the company shifted to remote production during the coronavirus pandemic. With market forces straining the ad market, the consolidation became permanent.</p><p>The transition, while prompted by the pandemic, signaled how the streaming-TV sands had shifted beneath Cheddar's feet yet again.</p><p>Cheddar had launched its second network, Cheddar News, when it was focusing on distribution on emerging streaming pay-TV services like Sling TV and YouTube TV. The pay-TV services that positioned themselves as cheaper alternatives to the classic cable bundle were happy to take more channels, especially ones like Cheddar that didn't require carriage fees, or what cable companies and other distributors pay networks to carry their channels.</p>

<p>But recently Cheddar has been looking to free ad-supported streaming-TV platforms like Pluto TV and Samsung TV Plus as the future. And the so-called FAST platforms pushed for a single channel.</p><p>"The FAST systems always wanted basically one channel that was sort of our best-of and had breaking news along with business news," Steinberg said.</p><p>"I don't think we ever really broke through with a clear delineation between Cheddar News and Cheddar Business," he added.</p><p>Currently, Cheddar makes most of its money from six- and seven-figure deals with brands like JPMorgan Chase to sponsor weekly segments or other integrated ads. But Steinberg said he thought the FAST services could help grow the revenue Cheddar makes from the programmatic and direct-sold local ads.</p><p>"The more that we grow the networks and the more that these FAST systems grow, the more opportunity we have in what I call 'indirect revenue,' or programmatic revenue to supplement the big sponsorship deals that we do," Steinberg said.</p><p>But it still would not diversify Cheddar beyond advertising, which has been a flashpoint for some critics.</p><p>Cheddar, unlike legacy networks, doesn't generate revenue from carriage fees. Not charging them allowed Cheddar to get wider distribution, but it also made it much more dependent on the advertising market, which has been hit hard by the pandemic.</p><p>Before it was acquired, Cheddar said it <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/cheddar-acquired-altice-usa-200-million-1203201331/">generated $27 million in revenue in 2018</a> and was on pace to nearly double it in 2019. Altice doesn't break out Cheddar's revenue, but revenue from the overall news-and-advertising division that includes Cheddar fell by 3%, to $202 million, during the first half of 2020, compared with the year earlier. The company blamed lower ad spending.</p>

<h2><strong>Cheddar has a vision of its future, but some insiders say the path is still murky</strong></h2><p>As TV advertising looks to rebound from the pandemic, what is the future of Cheddar's post-cable model?</p><p>Cheddar has two things going for it right now. First, people are paying more attention to news during the coronavirus pandemic and the US presidential election, pushing some streaming platforms to make news programming more prominent.</p><blockquote class="instagram-media">

		</p></blockquote><p>Fox's free on-demand service, Tubi, recently added a slew of live-news channels, including Cheddar and News 12. Hulu added live ABC News coverage to its on-demand service this year. (The companies have the same parent, Disney.) Bloomberg Media also said it would <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bloomberg-aims-to-disrupt-cable-tv-and-itself-with-streaming-relaunch">relaunch its QuickTake video-news brand</a> as a linear-streaming service.</p><p>Second, streaming viewership as a whole is up. Cheddar's traffic in June was up 72% from February, and its user base rose by 86% during that time, according to Altice's latest quarterly report.</p><p>"Whether or not [Cheddar] retains the viewership that was gained during the pandemic is really going to determine the future," one former staffer said.</p><p>That's the reality for not only Cheddar. Much of the media industry &#8212; including news organizations like The New York Times, subscription streamers like Netflix and Disney Plus, and FAST services like Pluto TV &#8212; is trying to figure out to hold on to audiences gained during the pandemic.</p><p>Cheddar has doubled down on distribution on FAST services and said Samsung TV Plus was its biggest viewership source among them. But the danger is that growth could stall at these services, like at the virtual pay-TV services before them.</p><p>"I never would have predicted that, certainly not four years ago," Steinberg said of the rise of FAST services. "There's seemingly a new one launched every day, and around which ones are going to be the biggest and which ones are going to be most successful, it's very hard to forecast."</p>

<p>While Cheddar has continued to release new programming around topics like climate change, the presidential election, and diversity and inclusion, as well as expand distribution to smart TVs like Vizio, Altice hasn't made major new investments in the company since the acquisition.</p><p>"It seems to me now &#8230; strategically, they wanted to check a box &#8212; local news, domestic, international," one former Cheddar staffer said of Altice. "Now they're reevaluating what they can get away with in terms of integrating the product and being able to monetize it. And how much product they really need."</p><p>Altice, meanwhile, has been investing in broadening its cable footprint, teaming up with Rogers Communications recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200902005626/en/Altice-USA-Inc.-Presents-Offer-to-Acquire-Cogeco-in-Order-to-Own-Atlantic-Broadband">on a bid for Cogeco</a>.</p><p>"It's not something that's a focus for investors," Jeff Wlodarczak, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said of Cheddar. "This is a nice little thing that seems to be doing quite well. The fact that it's growing is nice."</p><p>But the existential question hanging over Cheddar's head is how hungry younger audiences are for a cable-TV news experience, its core value proposition. Cheddar has not been able to get distribution on major streaming video-on-demand services &#8212; Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max, and so on &#8212; and it isn't clear that those have an appetite for news programming besides documentaries and weekly programs. These services are the titans in the streaming industry and have become the key distributors to reach younger audiences.</p><p>"At the end of the day," DiMarco said, "when you're in the media business, it's about distribution."</p>

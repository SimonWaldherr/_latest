With over 7,000 reviews, many customers note it’s so durable it does a particularly fantastic job of not flipping inside out during windy days.

Like looking up at the bright blue sky through a sunroof, this translucent umbrella allows you to continue you to be one with your surroundings. It provides extra protection against the elements thanks to a sturdy plastic coating. Reviewers say this best-selling umbrella checks every box: “When I used it for the first time, it was raining really hard and extremely windy due to a storm passing by and it kept me dry and didn't break/get damaged. I love the structure so much because it covers you and you can also see through the umbrella to see where you're going. Plus it's super cute and stylish. I love this umbrella so much, best purchase ever!”

While the goal is to social distance wherever we are, sometimes packed city streets make that impossible. What will have your back (and keep it dry, too), is this 32-inch umbrella designed specifically not to knock into pedestrians, and that folds neatly into a 14-inch cylinder for easy storage. As the “last umbrella you’ll ever need,” according to the brand with over 400 positive ratings, customers say it's worth the higher price tag: "I've had my Metro umbrella for four rainy, windy, crowded public transport winters and it's still like new. I love that it's small enough to slip into my bag. Worth every cent. Couldn't recommend more highly."

With four 40-inch canopy color option and seven LED color options, you’ll enjoy ultimate visibility and protection from the elements. With over 1,000 reviews, customers say how much they appreciate how easy it is to carry around, whether it’s slung around your back on handheld: “This is the most fantastic umbrella ever! I'm very glad I bought it. It's very durable, even in high winds. It slides open very smoothly and doesn't catch when taking it down either. The carrying case is very helpful and allows you to have your hands free when not in use or on public transportation, with chance of leaving it behind, because you can just wear it over your shoulder or back.”

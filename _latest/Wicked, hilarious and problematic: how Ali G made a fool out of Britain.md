<div><p>Dominic English, series editor and producer on The 11 O&#8217;Clock Show, recalls that during the peak of Ali G&#8217;s popularity, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/sacha-baron-cohen-bringing-back-borat-will-easily-offended/">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> &#8211; the real-world alter-ego of the Staines Massive's main man &#8211; was in the boozer with Madonna. &#8220;Someone said, &#8216;Did you hear that Sacha&#8217;s been in the Dun Cow with Madonna and Guy Ritchie?&#8217;&#8221; laughs English. &#8220;Everyone was like, &#8216;What the f&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;?!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Just a few years earlier, Baron Cohen had trialled a proto-Ali G character &#8211; a posh rapper named MC Jocelyn Cheadle-Hume&#160;&#8211; by taking him out-and-about: he talked street with a group of wannabe gangsta skaters; stormed a tourist bus and announced: &#8220;Yo, check it out. I is here, and this is me bus. Booyakasha&#8221;; and got thrown out of a pub for breakdancing.&#160;</p>
<p>Baron Cohen later described the adrenaline rush from discovering this new form of comedy. &#8220;Probably it existed, and other people had done it,&#8221; he told Rolling Stone. &#8220;But we&#8217;d never discovered it before &#8211; this idea of taking a comic character into a real situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Debuting on The 11 O&#8217;Clock Show in September 1998, Ali G went from word-of-mouth hit (the word-of-mouth mostly being people doing &#8220;Aight!&#8221; and &#8220;Booyakasha&#8221; impressions, or snapping their fingers at each other) to cultural phenomenon. According to Princes William and Harry, even the Queen Mother snapped her fingers and said &#8220;Respec&#8217;&#8221; after Christmas lunch at Sandringham.</p>
<p>In 2000, Ali G launched his own TV series, Da Ali G Show, and cameoed in a video for Madonna&#8217;s dancefloor thumper Music (hence Barton Cohen&#8217;s pub session with Madge, presumably). By 2002, he starred in his own film, Ali G Indahouse, and released a single, Me Julie, with Shaggy.&#160;</p>

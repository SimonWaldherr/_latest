Roberta McCain, the mother of late Arizona Senator and presidential candidate John McCain, has died, her daughter-in-law said Monday.

She was 108.

“It is with great sadness that I announce the death of my wonderful Mother In-law, Roberta McCain,” wrote Cindy McCain in a tweet. “I couldn’t have asked for a better role model or a better friend. She joins her husband Jack, her son John and daughter Sandy.”

Born Roberta Wright in Muskogee, Oklahoma, she married US Navy ensign John McCain Jr. in 1933.

In 1936, the couple welcomed son John McCain III, who would grow up to be a military hero in his own right and pursued a career in politics after his release as a POW in the Vietnam War.

McCain III, who earned the Republican nomination for president in 2008 but lost to Barack Obama, died in 2018 following a lengthy battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer.

Roberta, then 106, was among the throngs to pay their respects to the lion of American politics at Washington, DC services in his honor.

She was also preceded in death by her daughter, Jean “Sandy” McCain, of mesothelioma, but survived by her third child, son Joe McCain.

McCain’s passing came just weeks after the birth of great-granddaughter Liberty to Meghan McCain, John III’s daughter.

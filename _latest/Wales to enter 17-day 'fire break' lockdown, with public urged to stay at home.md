<div><p>Wales will enter <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/wales-lockdown-fire-break-latest-local-rules-welsh-restrictions/">a 17-day &#8220;fire break&#8221; lockdown on Friday</a>, after the&#160;First Minister Mark Drakeford set out&#160;"sharp and deep" new measures.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference, Mr Drakeford&#160;announced the closure of retail, hospitality, tourism venues and places of worship. He confirmed that&#160;everyone in Wales will be &#8220;required to stay at home&#8221; apart from critical workers.</p>
<p>Mr Drakeford said the country is facing a very "serious situation" due to coronavirus and warned&#160;that "critical care units are already full".</p>
<p>"There are no easy choices in front of us as the virus spreads in every part of Wales," he said.</p>
<p>The First Minister met with the Welsh Cabinet this morning to come to a &#8220;final decision&#8221; on the country&#8217;s coronavirus measures, after considering advice from experts.</p>
<p>It comes after a leaked letter from a regional director of the Confederation of Passenger Transport to its members in Wales suggested&#160;that restrictions will come into effect at 6pm on Friday October 23, and will last until 12.01 am on Monday November 9.</p>
<p>Last week, details of the lockdown were outlined in a letter to transport operators from John Pockett, director of the Confederation of Passenger Transport Cymru.</p>

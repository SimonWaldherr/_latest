Pop queen Ariana Grande left fans salivating on Wednesday after revealing that she will be dropping her new album before the end of the month.

The platinum selling sensation, 27, whose latest hit Rain On Me with Lady Gaga debuted at number one, teased her fans with the surprising news on social media.

'I can't wait to give u my album this month,' she wrote on Twitter and Instagram.

The album was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the January 2020 Grammy Awards, but she sadly went home empty-handed despite five nominations.

The record was written in the midst of personal struggles with ex-fiancee Pete Davidson, and after grappling with the death of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller, who died a month after her 2018 album Sweetener was released.

After the two very public relationships, Grande has since moved onto a more private one with luxury real estate agent, Dalton Gomez, 27.

In recent news, Rain On Me has been nominated for Best Video, Best Song, and Best Collaboration at the upcoming MTV Europe Music Awards.

The NFL is doing what it can to fit Tennessee Titans games into the schedule following a COVID-19 outbreak within the organization.

According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the scheduled game between the Titans and Buffalo Bills is being moved from Sunday to Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET if nobody else on Tennessee tests positive. What's more, the game between the Bills and Kansas City Chiefs that was scheduled for next Thursday will be moved to Sunday.

However, it will go back to Thursday if there are more positive tests on the Titans.

The NFL announced the full schedule change:

Bryan DeArdo of CBS Sports noted 23 Titans players and personnel members have not tested positive for COVID-19 since Sept. 24, which forced the league to adjust its schedule accordingly.

Tennessee's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers was pushed back from Week 3 to Week 7, which meant both teams ended up with earlier byes than anticipated. Elsewhere, the league pushed back a game between the Chiefs and New England Patriots to this past Monday because Cam Newton tested positive.

Judy Battista of NFL.com recently spoke with the NFL's chief medical officer, Dr. Allen Sills, and he said the league has not taken the option of pausing the season off the table with so many positive tests and the schedule being constantly adjusted.

As for Tennessee, Titans insider Paul Kuharsky (h/t Patrik Walker of CBS Sports) reported some members of the team, including quarterback Ryan Tannehill, were seen potentially violating the NFL's COVID-19 protocols by gathering at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tenn.

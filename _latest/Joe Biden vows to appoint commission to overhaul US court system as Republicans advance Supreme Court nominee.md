  Joe Biden vows to appoint commission to overhaul US court system as Republicans advance Supreme Court nominee 
description: > 
  Joe Biden announced he will form a "bipartisan" commission to study the possibility of overhauling the US court system if he is elected to the White House, as Republicans advanced Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination on Thursday.The Democratic presidential candidate has been under pressure to give his position on the controversial idea of "court packing", a proposal favoured by progressives to add more justices to the nine-member Supreme Court.Mr Biden has been reluctant to give a definitive answer on the matter but said last week that he would make his position known to voters before election day.In an interview with CBS News, Mr Biden said he would appoint a commission comprised of constitutional scholars and politicians from across the spectrum to consider "how to reform the court system because it's getting out of whack."It comes as Republicans moved at unprecedented speed to confirm Ms Barrett, Donald Trump's nomination for a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, despite Democrats' opposition to the appointment.

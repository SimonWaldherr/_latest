This is a tale of two elder British statesmen and their approach to mask-wearing. One is the Prince of Wales, leading by example in a handsome blue-checked suit, mint-toned tie and matching peacock-blue face mask with a jaunty print, while meeting key workers in Northern Ireland this week.

The other is Stanley Johnson, the outspoken father of the PM, who has twice been photographed – boarding a train and in a packed lift – wearing his face covering incorrectly. Like the term Covid-19 itself, we’re speaking a whole new language we couldn’t have imaged this time last year. And now that face coverings are the norm, the idea of your mask as not just a medical must but part of your gentlemanly attire has evolved.

I say ‘gentlemanly’ because men tend to be more uniform in their accessories, and where he would have selected his silk tie and pocket square to align with his suit, now that old-school customer is matching his mask, too. Prince Charles said as much when quizzed about his choice of face covering, commenting that he opts for face masks in complementary colours to the rest of his accessories, and in sustainable fabrics.

His version was handmade by seamstresses at his own charity, Turquoise Mountain, which helps protect heritage crafts in Myanmar.

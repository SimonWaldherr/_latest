A federal judge on Friday struck down a motion to extend voter registration in Florida by three days after a technical problem on the state's website that might have prevented as many as thousands of people from casting their votes in the election next month.

U.S. District Court Judge Mark Walker in his ruling called the decision "an incredibly close call" but said the state's interest in preventing chaos in its already precarious – and perennially chaotic – election outweighs the substantial burden imposed on the right to vote."

Walker said the court "is not persuaded that an injunction … would not be adverse to the public interest," adding that the "court is mindful of the potential for voter confusion that could result" from extending the registration deadline.

Despite his ruling, Walker's decision was filled with criticism of the state.

"This court notes that every man who has stepped foot on the moon launched from the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida. Yet, Florida has failed to figure out how to run an election properly – a task simpler than rocket science," Walker said.

The decision comes after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis extended the state's voter registration deadline through 7 p.m. on Tuesday after the state's website crashed on Monday, the initial deadline. While the deadline was extended, the "cure had at least one major flaw," Walker said: People weren't given enough notice of the extension.

Florida's chief information officer, James Grant, told The Associated Press that the servers for Florida's voting system "were configured in a way that reduced its capacity to a fraction of a fraction of what it was capable of."

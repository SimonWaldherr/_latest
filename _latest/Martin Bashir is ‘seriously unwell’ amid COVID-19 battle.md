<p>&#8220;We are sorry to say that Martin is seriously unwell with COVID-19 related complications,&#8221; a BBC rep <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54639674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement.</a> &#8220;Everyone at the BBC is wishing him a full recovery. We&#8217;d ask that his privacy, and that of his family, is respected at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 57-year-old is famed for his <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/04/martin-bashir-got-princess-diana-tell-all-by-misleading-her-brother/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explosive 1995 interview</a> with Princess Diana, in which she exposed royal acts of adultery. Nearly 23 million viewers watched the night the people&#8217;s princess bared her soul about her failed marriage to Prince Charles &#8212; and his affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. &#8220;There were three of us in this marriage,&#8221; she told Bashir.</p>
<p>However, 25 years later, Bashir was accused of scoring the scoop by stoking Diana&#8217;s paranoia that the secret service was bugging her private conversations and by using fake bank statements to get her brother, Earl Spencer, to help secure the interview, the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bbc-journalist-martin-bashir-misled-dianas-brother-to-secure-bombshell-interview-2x6nj28jm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunday Times of London reported</a>.</p>
<p>Bashir also courted controversy with his lurid 2003 ITV/ABC documentary &#8220;Living with Michael Jackson.&#8221; He has worked as the religion editor for BBC news since 2016.</p>
<p>He returned to the UK outlet after a run as the host of ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Nightline,&#8221; followed by an anchor position at MSNBC. He infamously left that gig in 2016 after receiving criticism for declaring vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin a &#8220;world-class idiot&#8221; and suggesting on-air that someone should defecate in her mouth.</p>

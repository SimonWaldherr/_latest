'So Kelly and I are actually doing to go away for a week and I don't really know what we are getting ourselves into I just know that I can't be around my family anymore.

'I've had it, I've had enough. And they all come down on me. Every time they ask me, "Mom can I download this app? Mom can I get on the Facetime? Mom I'm hungry. Is this outfit okay? Can you help me."

The Honest Company founder added that she'll try and get Cash to help with the kids' demands but he'll often disappear to his man cave.

'Then I just start nagging and I'm just nagging and I'm that person and then they are like, "Mom, your tone you’re so mean." And then Cash is like, "I guess I’m just going to go back into my man room," And I’m like, "What else is new?" Just disappearing for me to deal with everything.'

The Sin City star then described the bedtime struggle she has with her kids.

'Now imagine, you have my 9-year-old she doesn’t want to go to bed, it’s a fight every night. I'm like, "What? Like you know you need to go to bed kid. This isn’t a thing, we shouldn’t talk about this."

'Then she goes, "Well you make dinner so late every time you make dinner." Here's the thing, "I'm going to make dinner late. You're going to eat late. Then you're going to get your butt to bed right after that and that's just the way it’s going to be. I don’t know what to say, I’m not perfect. You’re going to eat dinner late."'

The Good Luck Chuck star married Cash, a film producer, in 2008 and the couple live in Los Angeles with their three children.

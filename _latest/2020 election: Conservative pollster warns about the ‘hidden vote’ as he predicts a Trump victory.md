  2020 election: Conservative pollster warns about the ‘hidden vote’ as he predicts a Trump victory 
description: > 
  “What we’ve noticed is that these polls are predominantly missing the hidden Trump vote.Mr Trump then surpassed that prediction by winning Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin – a feat not done by a Republican presidential candidate in decades.Most polls currently show Mr Biden with a substantial lead of about nine to 10 points ahead of the sitting president nationally.Additionally, Mr Biden has held a lead in the battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.However, Mr Cahaly predicted that the president will hold Florida, Georgia, Ohio, and North Carolina given the slim lead Mr Biden currently holds did not factor in the “hidden vote”.

There is a clear feeling among conservatives and people that are for the president that they&#8217;re not interested in sharing their opinions readily," he said. "These people are more hesitant to participate in polls. So if you&#8217;re not compensating for this, you&#8217;re not going to get honest answers.&#8221;</p><p></p><p>In 2016, Mr Cahaly was one of the few pollsters to predict the president winning key battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.

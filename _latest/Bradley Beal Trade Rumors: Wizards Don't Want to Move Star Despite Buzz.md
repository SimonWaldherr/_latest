He has two more seasons before deciding on a 2022-&#8217;23 player option, which buys the Wizards time. Not that the Wizards have been in anything other than purgatory the last few seasons, but moving Beal means a full-scale rebuild."</p><p class="">The report came amid a larger conversation regarding whether Beal could potentially find himself as a Denver Nugget via trade.</p><p id="br-ad-17006701" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Such a move would require Denver to deal Michael Porter Jr., per Singer, who said that is a "non-starter" for the Nuggets "unless they get a superstar in return."<br></p><p class="">Beal averaged a career-high 30.5 points and 6.1 assists for the Wizards last season. He absorbed more usage without <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/john-wall">John Wall</a>, who missed the entire 2019-20 campaign with a ruptured left Achilles tendon.</p><p class="">Beal&#160;has made it clear multiple times that he wants to stay in Washington, D.C. He said as much in a March 6 article written with&#160;<a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/wizards-star-bradley-beal-if-i-can-control-it-i-will-finish-in-dc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc J.

If it happens, it happens. But if I can control it, I will finish in D.C.</p><p class="">"For me, I am kind of loyal to a fault. I'm kind of like Dame [Damian&#160;Lillard] in this realm that it would probably mean so much more to you winning it in Portland or winning it in D.C., because you know you grinding all those years. Then once you eventually come out of that light, I feel like the feeling would be so much grander than necessarily jumping ship. Jumping ship is kind of the easy way out. But at the same time, there's no guarantee that you'll win."</p><p class="">When&#160;<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/ny-bradley-beal-nets-wizards-20200521-6y2x66whwbaknn3kxwwwi62hni-story.html?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trade rumors</a>&#160;regarding the Brooklyn Nets' potential interest in&#160;Beal&#160;swirled in May, the ex-Florida star took time to address them while reiterating his stance that he wants to stay in comments made to ESPN's&#160;<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29240441/wizards-bradley-beal-says-trade-rumors-sign-respect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackie&#160;MacMullan</a>.</p><p class="">"It's not the first time I've heard this kind of talk.

When you hear that&#160;Kyrie&#160;[Irving]&#160;and&#160;KD&#160;[Kevin Durant] want you, s--t, that's amazing. At the same time, you don't know how much there is to it, or how easy it would be to do. And I've put down roots in D.C. I've dedicated myself to this town, this community. I love it here, and it would feel great to know I could grind out winning here instead of jumping to another team."</p><p class="">Beal&#160;is under contract with Washington through the 2022-23 season after inking a two-year, $72 million max extension last October, per ESPN's&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1184799756834562048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adrian&#160;Wojnarowski</a>.&#160;</p><p class="">At the time,&#160;Wojnarowski&#160;said that&#160;Beal&#160;would be able to sign the most lucrative contract in NBA history in 2022 (five years, $266 million) if he declines his 2022-23 option and re-signs with the Wizards.</p><p class="">Injuries hit the Wizards hard last season, with the team putting 23 players on the court during its 25-47 campaign.&#160;They also featured 16 different starters, and&#160;Beal&#160;and rookie&#160;Rui&#160;Hachimura&#160;were&#160;the only two players who started every game they played.</p><p class="">The Wizards will look to get Wall back from injury in 2020-21, and they also own the Nos. 9 and 37 picks in the 2020 NBA draft.</p></div>

 <p>     </p> <p>The male student then blocked her on Tinder.</p> <p> Ms Yeneka told <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/edinburgh/2020/10/19/black-edinburgh-student-called-fit-george-floyd-on-tinder-by-white-student-67730" rel="nofollow">The Tab</a> : &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty horrific. He super-liked me just to match me and tell me my profile was &#8216;George Floyd fit&#8217;, as if being racist wasn&#8217;t already grossly offensive, it&#8217;s really twisted referring to a dead black man who deserves respect. </p> <p>"He probably thought it was hilarious. As for the apology, I don&#8217;t know why he bothered. It reads as it looks &#8211; meaningless &#8211; with the concern of being caught out.&#8221;</p> <p>Speaking about the message she received, Ms Yeneka said: &#8220;Considering the dating world is predominately online right now, we don&#8217;t get the same experience as white people.</p>

   <p>&#8220;As a black woman, I constantly worry about what my matches are thinking. Did they match me because they&#8217;ve &#8216;never been with a black&#160;girl&#8217;? Could I open Tinder and be stunned with an overtly racist message? Could they be racially abusive in real life and I just don&#8217;t know it yet?</p> <p>&#8220;Although dating through a screen has an element of desensitisation, people forget that BAME people are humans, with their own feelings and sadly for some of us, our own racial trauma. The world has taught us to date with our guard up.&#8221;</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

Hong Kong (CNN Business) The Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom has called on Twitter to investigate after its ambassador's official account appeared to "like" a pornographic post.

The apparent sexually explicit "like" was first identified by a London-based human rights campaigner on Wednesday. It quickly set off a storm online as Twitter users speculated about whether ambassador Liu Xiaoming's account had been hacked.

The account also appeared to "like" at least one other post which was critical of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. It is not clear how long the apparent "likes" remained active, or when they first appeared.

A "like" on Twitter does not necessarily mean that the user is endorsing the content; "likes" are often used as bookmarks.

All of the "liked" tweets on the account have now been removed, apart from just two of his own posts from October 2019. The ambassador has more than 85,000 followers on his official account.

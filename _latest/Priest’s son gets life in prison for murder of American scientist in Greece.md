A 28-year-old Greek farmer was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday for the rape and murder of American scientist Suzanne Eaton in Crete last year.

Ioannis Paraskakis, the son of a priest, was found guilty of the July 2019 crime by a court in the town of Rethymno, according to Agence France-Presse.

Authorities said he ran Eaton over on a rural road before putting her in the trunk of a car and driving to an abandoned World War II bunker where he sexually assaulted her and dumped her body.

The 59-year-old molecular biologist at the renowned Max Planck Institute in Dresden, Germany, had been on the island of Crete for a conference when she vanished July 2 after going on a run.

Her body was found six days later, dumped facedown deep inside the bunker in the port city of Chania. Police said the married mother of two sons was asphyxiated and small stab wounds were also found on her body.

“This was a world-class biologist,” prosecution lawyer Vasso Pantazi said of the Oakland-born scientist.

“In terms of virus contagiousness and vaccines, you can understand how useful she would have been today.”

Paraskakis, a married dad of two, initially confessed to the sick crime, claiming he was “possessed by demons” at the time, a police officer testified at his trial.

“He said he was possessed by demons giving him orders,” the cop said.

He later recanted, saying his confession was made under duress. He claimed he ran Eaton over accidentally and denied raping her.

The court sentenced Paraskakis to life imprisonment for murder and 13 years for rape. His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.

The victim’s sister, Julie Eaton Broaddus, was present at the start of the trial, but later left court because she said she couldn’t stand being in the same room at the suspect.

“It was really, really difficult to come here. But I felt that I needed to be here, to speak up for what an amazing and accomplished woman she was,” Broaddus said.

She described her sister as a “loving, doting mother” and said her death was “a horrible, tragic thing.”

Eaton was married to British scientist Anthony Hyman, who is devastated and has developed post-traumatic stress disorder, Broaddus said.

Americans with higher educational attainment tend to earn higher incomes and live healthier lives than those with lower educational attainment. High school attainment has consistently increased over time, providing a larger share of the population with access to higher education and higher-paying job opportunities. In many American cities, the high school graduation rate is much higher than it is nationwide, and in a few it is higher than 95% of the 25 and over population.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">To determine the cities where the most people graduate high school, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s 2019 American Community Survey.

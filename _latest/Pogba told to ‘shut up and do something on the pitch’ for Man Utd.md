Paul Pogba has been told to “shut up and do something on the pitch” after reiterating his dream to play for Real Madrid.

Pundits Jan-Aage Fjortoft and Steve Nicol revealed their distaste at Pogba’s latest comments over his desire to play for the Spanish giants.

Pogba was asked about his United future and links to Madrid after France’s 7-1 win over Ukraine.

“Many things have been said,” Pogba said. “Of course, every footballer would love to play for Real Madridand would dream about that. It’s a dream of mine, so why not one day?

“But I’m at Manchester United and I love my club. I play for Manchester United, I want to perform well for them and do everything to get them back to where they deserve to be.”

He added: “Every player goes through difficult periods but you have to be strong mentally and we all need to try and get the team back to where it belongs,” Pogba said. “It belongs at the top, fighting for trophies, that’s the club’s ambition. We know it’s not easy, but that remains our objective. We are fighting for that.”

Fjortcroft was not happy with the World Cup winner’s comments.

“It’s time that he shuts up and tries to do something on the pitch,” he said on ESPN.

Former Liverpool right-back Steve Nicol was also weighed in.

“I don’t understand why players are so stupid,” he said.

“Just because someone asked you a question, you don’t have to answer it.

“If you do answer it, all you have to say is ‘I’m happy at Manchester United, that’s the only thing I’m thinking about’, and that’s the end of the story.

“I think it tells you more about Paul Pogba. I’ve actually been sticking up for him for a long time – probably the first two years of his time at Manchester United.

“But it’s really clear, this guy has absolutely zero leadership in him, and you can tell.”

The government-sponsored clinical trial of Eli Lilly's antibody treatment for the coronavirus has paused enrollment, the drugmaker confirmed Tuesday.

"Safety is of the utmost importance to Lilly. We are aware that, out of an abundance of caution, the ACTIV-3 independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has recommended a pause in enrollment," Eli Lilly spokeswoman Molly McCully in a statement.

The company did not provide any details on the safety concern.

"Lilly is supportive of the decision by the independent DSMB to cautiously ensure the safety of the patients participating in this study," McCully said.

In addition to receiving either Eli Lilly's antibody drug or a placebo, the patients in the trial were also administered remdesivir. The trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Pauses in large clinical trials are not unusual, health experts have said. The development follows news that Johnson & Johnson paused its vaccine trial "due to an unexplained illness in a study participant," according to the company. AstraZeneca's vaccine trial in the U.S. is still on pause after a patient fell ill.

He said: "I've been asked to speak to you today about the dire situation that faces our hospitals in Liverpool. We have got over 300 patients in beds and our intensive care capacity is currently running at 90 per cent. At this rate, we are looking at exceeding healthcare capacity in the next week or so."

On Monday, Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Steve Warburton told staff the trust had reached a "critical point".

Steve Rotheram, the Metro Mayor of the region, said: "The hospitals are concerned that they could be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people who are presenting with Covid symptoms, and of course the strain that puts on ICU and on other functions within the hospital."

He stressed that the Nightingale hospital for the North-West, in Manchester, is on standby.

The trust said 90 per cent of intensive care beds were full on Monday, but that figure had dropped to 80 per cent by Wednesday evening.

University Hospitals Birmingham, which runs four hospitals in the city, said it was cancelling routine operations to make space for Covid patients in intensive care units. A trust spokesman said its units were running at 100 per cent capacity, with around one in four patients suffering from Covid.

Nottingham University Hospitals Trust is now treating as many Covid patients as it was during the first wave of the pandemic. The trust has begun cancelling operations and been forced to close beds amid outbreaks on wards, a leaked memo seen by the Health Service Journal warns.

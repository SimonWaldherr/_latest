The effort is led by a retired colonel, played by Bernard Miles (who also co-wrote, co-directed and co-produced the film); but the enemy arrives in two guises. First there is the agricultural committee, which orders the field to be ploughed up. Luckily, the colonel was at school with the minister, and a trip to Whitehall and the use of the Old Boy Network soon puts paid to that scheme. Second, a rogue dealer in birds’ eggs who hears of the nesting pair sets out to steal the eggs to sell to a collector. Happily he is intercepted by soldiers, one of whom turns out to be an ornithologist. The eggs hatch, and in the final scene the recovered Bancroft salutes the fledglings as he flies overhead in his Spitfire.

Tawny Pipit is a deeply atavistic film. It not only makes an allegory of the greater fight between good and evil, but does so by deploying the English countryside as a reminder of the civilisation, history and values for which we were fighting. To cinema audiences in 1944 it presented a sense of decency and shamed those who sought to subvert it, while showing how life, not death, prevailed. The use of an ancient landscape is familiar from other films of the time, with a similar message and effect. Went the Day Well? would not have been nearly so shocking had it been set in some charmless industrial town; but because it takes place in a village of almost surreal pastorality it captures the contrast between violence and serenity with terrible vividness.

A Canterbury Tale, which had its premiere a fortnight after Tawny Pipit’s, also romanticised the landscape to evoke the continuity of a way of life that would carry on once barbarism was defeated. Though the plot of Tawny Pipit may sound comically minor, this underappreciated film is of towering significance to our idea of ourselves. It is also one of the most charming landmarks in the history of British cinema.

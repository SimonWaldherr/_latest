Theatre has proved itself a British success story domestically and internationally, generating £6 for every £1 of funding. The West End as an ecosystem brings £5 billion to London's economy alone. We’re not just viable, we’re one of the most valuable, innovative and essential industries on the planet, but without sector specific support to cover our temporary crisis, we are being abandoned by a government content to throw in the towel.

It’s entirely illogical: its own £1.57 billion package will end up paying for the very redundancies it is seeking to avoid and, as far as I’m aware, won't touch the sides in terms of helping industry freelancers. At the very least, the government needs to provide proper support to our workforce now, publish clear guidance on the public health conditions and safety measures required for us to resume performances, and underwrite the cost of insurance.

In return, they can ensure the return of our sector - worth £7 billion to the UK economy - is at the heart of the nation’s recovery from this crisis.

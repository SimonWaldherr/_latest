  The Witches review: this sappy, CGI-soaked remake is an embarrassment to Roald Dahl

<div><p><strong>Dir: Robert Zemeckis; Cast: Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, Jahzir Bruno, Chris Rock, Stanley Tucci, Morgana Robinson, Charles Edwards, Kristin Chenoweth, Codie-Lei Eastick, 106 mins.</strong></p>
<p>Roald Dahl&#8217;s The Witches has the pungent power we associate with his best books, a formula which bubbled over wickedly into cinema once before. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2018/11/24/nicolas-roeg-film-director-unique-style-best-known-dont-look/">Nicolas Roeg</a>, of Don't Look Now fame,&#160;was mired in a creative rut when <strong>producer</strong> Jim Henson picked him&#160;to direct the 1990 film. The result was a seriously warped, wonderful adaptation which only failed in two respects. Dahl was appalled by the change to his ending, and the release got tangled up by a corporate merger, hobbling its box office.</p>
<p>2020&#8217;s uncertainties have consigned the new remake to an uncinematic fate of its own &#8211; straight to VoD &#8211; which is no longer an automatic indication of something sub-par. (The same is happening with Pixar&#8217;s <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/soul-review-pixar-stares-death-face-warmth-wit-wonder/">Soul</a> at Christmas.) With the best will in the world, though, it&#8217;s hard not to watch Robert Zemeckis and his cast dig back into this story without rooting for a redo that&#8217;s significantly more special.</p>
<p>The first iffy innovation is a Chris Rock voiceover, giving us the basic facts about witches up front &#8211; they&#8217;re real, they&#8217;re out to get children, and he should know, since he was a young orphan in 1968 Alabama (played for the remaining duration by Jahzir Bruno), and ran into a whole coven.</p>
<p>Before the hotel stay where this showdown will occur, the film&#8217;s best twenty minutes idle by, thanks chiefly to Octavia Spencer&#8217;s reliable warmth as grandma, helping depressed, eight-year-old Charlie through the trauma of a snowy car wreck which killed his mom and dad.</p>

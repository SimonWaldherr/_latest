The FTSE is expected to rise modestly on Monday as the government is set to unveil a new coronavirus three-tier alert system. Markets in Asia jumped with China leading the way as investors bet on a steady recovery for the world's no. 2 economy.

British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz has stepped down from his role as the airline navigates one of the most challenging times in its history. He will be replaced by Aer Lingus chairman and chief executive Sean Doyle.

The UK hospitality industry is mounting a legal challenge to the government's lockdown restrictions, aiming to stop its plans to close pubs and other venues to tackle the rise in coronavirus cases.

Eddie Stobart Group saw its underlying earnings climb to Â£16.6million in the six months to May 31, thanks to a 'strong performance' in its grocery and consumer goods division, which has helped to make up coronavirus-related losses in other sectors.

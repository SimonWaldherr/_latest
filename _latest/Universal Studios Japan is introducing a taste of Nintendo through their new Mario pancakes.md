In case you haven't heard, there's a Super Nintendo World theme park that's currently in the works in Japan.

While the theme park hasn't officially opened its doors yet, there have been several sneak peeks of its layout and it's been looking really cool so far.

But while we're waiting for Super Nintendo World to open, Universal Studios Japan (USJ) is opening a Mario World of its own this month.

Located in USJ's Hollywood Boulevard, "Mario Cafe & Store" will be opening its doors on October 16, 2020.

Dubbed as the world's first Mario café and store, the shop will be selling yummy snacks and drinks as well cute merchandise of the franchise.

While there are no official pictures yet, Nintendo has plenty of concept art.

Some of the snacks that'll be on sale in the Mario café include the following.

Fruit pancake sandwiches in the shapes of Mario and Luigi's hats.

Fruit cream sodas with the signature mustaches of our favorite plumber brothers.

And even a drink in a cute Super Mushroom bottle.

Meanwhile, a merchandise store will also be opening next to the cafe!

What are they selling you ask? Lots of Mario-themed goodies such as Mario and Luigi's hats and even Princess Peach's crown!

Cute!

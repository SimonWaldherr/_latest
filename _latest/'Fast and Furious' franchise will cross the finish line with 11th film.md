<div><p>Family is forever, but all good things must still come to an end.</p>
<p>The beloved Fast and Furious franchise will sadly reach its finish line after an eleventh film, according to a new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/fast-and-furious-franchise-ending-justin-lin-1234811481/" target="_blank">Variety</a>. Fast and Furious veteran Justin Lin will return to direct the final two instalments, having previously steered Fast &amp; Furious, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6, and next year's F9. (He also directed The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, but we don't talk about that.)&#160;</p>
<p>Then it's Coronas and family barbecues ever after for the First Family of increasingly improbable car stunts.</p>
<p>Variety's report states that this will only be the end of the central Fast and Furious franchise, so it's possible there will still be new side stories in the Fast and Furious universe. Previous such additions have included the delightfully fun <a href="https://me.mashable.com/entertainment/6444/hobbs-shaw-injects-fresh-blood-into-the-fast-furious-franchise">Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw</a>, as well as Netflix animated series <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/04/23/fast-and-furious-animated/">Fast and Furious Spy Racers</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, it looks like family members Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Mia (Jordana Brewster), and Han (Sung Kang) will no longer be living their lives a quarter mile at a time, barring spinoffs.&#160;</p>
<p>It's the end of an era, but what an era it's been.</p>

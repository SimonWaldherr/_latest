<div><p>The Department of Justice agrees with spy chief John Ratcliffe&#8217;s assessment that emails <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">published by The Post</a> from a laptop owned by Hunter Biden are not part of a Russian disinformation campaign, a report said.</p>
<p>Sources told Fox News that the FBI is also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sources-tell-fox-news-fbi-has-possession-of-purported-hunter-biden-laptop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indeed in possession</a> of the Hunter Biden laptop that the emails were copied from.</p>
<p>The first story The Post published about Hunter&#8217;s emails <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">included a photo</a> of a Delaware federal subpoena that show both the computer and its hard drive were seized by the FBI in December, after a computer repairman said he alerted federal authorities to their existence.</p>
<p>On Monday, Ratcliffe, the Director of National Intelligence, said the emails were &#8220;not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop is not part of some Russian disinformation campaign,&#8221; Ratcliffe said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me be clear: The intelligence community doesn&#8217;t believe that because there is no intelligence that supports that. And we have shared no intelligence with Adam Schiff, or any member of Congress,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, had claimed the emails were part of a smear orchestrated by Moscow.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe blasted Schiff for the allegations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny that some of the people who complain the most about intelligence being politicized are the ones politicizing the intelligence,&#8221; Ratcliffe said. &#8220;Unfortunately, it is Adam Schiff who said the intelligence community believes the Hunter Biden laptop and emails on it are part of a Russian disinformation campaign.&#8221;</p>

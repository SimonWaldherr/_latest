<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he sees no reason to offer an apology to Brooklyn and Queens&#8217; ultra-Orthodox Jewish community over the recent COVID-19 hot-spot lockdowns <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/de-blasio-apologizes-to-ultra-orthodox-leaders-over-covid-19/">as did Mayor Bill de Blasio</a> a day earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Cuomo simply said during an Albany press briefing when asked by a Post reporter whether he believes an apology is owed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry that they feel the disruption, I am sorry that they are disrupted, their religious ceremonies are disrupted, how many people they can have in a synagogue is disrupted, how many people they can have at a wedding is disrupted, the operation of their schools is disrupted. I am sorry for that,&#8221; said Cuomo.</p>
<p>The governor continued, &#8220;In the same way I&#8217;m sorry to the Catholic community and Muslim community and to all New Yorkers. I&#8217;m sorry that we are going through this. I&#8217;m sorry that people are dying. I&#8217;m sorry the state has to impose disruptions on your life. I&#8217;m sorry that we had to close your businesses which may mean you lose your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a way to combat the emergence of coronavirus cluster zones in Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods &#8212; some of which have large Orthodox Jewish populations &#8212; Cuomo earlier this month <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/06/cuomo-orders-shutdowns-in-covid-19-hit-areas-of-nyc/">ordered a color-coded system of restrictions</a>, including the closures of schools and non-essential businesses, in the effect areas.</p>
<p>Those restrictions had prompted anti-lockdown protests in the Orthodox Jewish enclave of Borough Park.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, de Blasio <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/de-blasio-apologizes-to-ultra-orthodox-leaders-over-covid-19/">offered a rare mea culpa to ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders</a> in Brooklyn and Queens, saying he didn&#8217;t clearly explain coronavirus regulations to the community.</p>

 
	<p>&#8220;I certainly got very frustrated at times when I saw large groups of people still out without masks, but I think more dialogue would have been better so I certainly want to express my regret that I didn&#8217;t figure out how to do that better,&#8221; de Blasio had said during a City Hall press briefing.</p>
<p>Cuomo, however, suggested that the state did all it can regarding communication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I believe we couldn&#8217;t communicate the rules of social distancing and mask wearing more than we communicated them? I suppose it&#8217;s always possible, but I think I have communicated more with the people of the state of New York than any governor in the history of the state of New York,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cuomo added, &#8220;If someone in New York says &#8216;I never heard this restriction that I have to wear a mask&#8230;I never heard that there were limits on the number of people who could be in a gathering place,&#8217; &#8212; I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s possible but I don&#8217;t know what else we could&#8217;ve done to communicate the social distancing requirements, I mean, I did it every day in every manner shape or form.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brooklyn Assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein, a Democrat who represents parts of Borough Park and Midwood, ripped Cuomo for his lack of apology.</p>
<p>&#8220;What he should apologize for is turning this into an Orthodox Jewish problem. For saying we never wanted to comply. That&#8217;s divisive language,&#8221; Eichenstein told The Post.</p>
 
<p>Eichenstein then cited language Cuomo had used during a press briefing last month in reference to the Orthodox Jewish community.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had to do this all over again, one of the lessons learned, I would have had the state takeover or hire statewide enforcement. Because the enforcement from the local governments is very uneven especially when it&#8217;s politically sensitive. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re running to with lot of these ultra-Orthodox communities, who are also very politically powerful, don&#8217;t kid yourself,&#8221; Cuomo <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/audio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-announces-state-will-withhold-funds-localities-and-schools" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had said during the Oct. 14 briefing</a>.</p>
<p>Eichenstein added, &#8220;Can you imagine him singling out any other ethnic or religious community as &#8216;politically powerful?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What hurts at a community level are these comments more than anything. This language is not okay &#8211; not okay. I&#8217;m sorry but no governor, no elected official can use this divisive language,&#8221; said Eichenstein.</p>
<p>The assemblyman said he does &#8220;not believe&#8221; Cuomo is &#8220;an anti-Semite,&#8221; but &#8220;he has to understand the words he uses can have lasting, damaging implications.&#8221;</p>

<p>The GOP's "natural instinct, depending on how big it is, and what's in it, is probably going to be to be against it," Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota told reporters on Monday.

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said a stimulus package costing $1.8 trillion or more is "way too high."</p><p>Others said they'd have to view the contents of the relief legislation before deciding how to vote. "I'd have to see what it is, but that's pretty high," Sen.

<p>"I would be willing to go more," he said in a Fox News phone interview.

<p>Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has rejected spending the hefty amounts under consideration and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-stimulus-package-coronavirus-relief-compromise-white-house-democrats-2020-10">suggested last week</a> he wouldn't put a deal on the floor for a vote. He said Saturday the Senate would "consider" a bipartisan relief bill without specifying.</p><p>On Tuesday, Senate Republicans are voting to renew the Paycheck Protection Program to aid small businesses. Then Wednesday, they will vote on a $500 billion economic aid bill. Democrats are likely to reject both as insufficient piecemeal measures.</p><p>There is substantial public support across both parties for a sizable government rescue package. A New York Times and Siena College poll <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/us101520-crosstabs1/016bc5d8ae03038c/full.pdf">released Tuesday</a> showed 72% of the American public back a $2 trillion federal relief plan that would extend enhanced unemployment insurance, send additional stimulus checks to Americans, and provide aid to state and local governments. Only 21% oppose it.</p>

“If you’re not allowed to investigate these things, you’re not doing your listeners or viewers any favours,” she said.

She also took aim at the BBC "[seeming] to want to bolster up the whole line that it was necessary to impose stricter restrictions".

Ms Cook added that she thought that BBC presenters were paid “too much” and said that she wonders if the days of the licence fee “are numbered”.

"I’ve given up listening to the Today programme as it was getting so stressful," she said.

"They don’t let anyone develop a thought, there is so much interrupting. It seems wrong … and I don’t feel I’m learning anything."

Ms Cook, a veteran presenter whose work with the national broadcaster won her acclaim throughout the decades, said that "it pains me to criticise the BBC".

"My instinct is to be loyal. But there would have been lots more investigation in my day of what happens in the test laboratories, what the tests involve," she said.

"The gap between cases and deaths keeps going up and up, but nobody has really investigated the veracity of these tests. Why isn’t the BBC asking questions about why this gap is getting wider and wider?"

An Ofcom spokesperson said that Ofcom “is not censoring debate about Covid-19” and “there is no prohibition on broadcasting views which differ from or challenge official authorities”.

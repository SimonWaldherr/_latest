<p>Back in the New York groove. The New York Giants have won their first football game since 2019. It was nowhere near pretty and very well could have been a loss in the final minute, but close only counts in horseshoes. A win is a win and the Giants will have a few days before they get right back at it Thursday in Philadelphia against the Eagles. To break down the 20-19 win over the Washington Football Team, we bring you a brand new episode of your favorite Giants podcast, &#8220;Blue Rush,&#8221; with two-time Super Bowl champion Lawrence Tynes and The Post&#8217;s Paul Schwartz.</p>
<p>The guys open the podcast talking about &#8220;Mr. Irrelevant&#8221; Tae Crowder&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/giants-come-up-with-huge-plays-to-finally-get-first-win/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">game-winning fumble recovery for a touchdown</a>. Talk about the unlikeliest of heroes, right? They get into Joe Judge getting his first win as head coach. &#8220;You always remember your first,&#8221; Paul says, hopefully referring to football. They talk about Daniel Jones&#8217; struggles, the interception that he should not have thrown, using his legs and running more and Kyle Allen outplaying him. The Giants have struggled to score when they get into the red zone. They finally did with the nice Darius Slayton score in the first half, but otherwise the offense went scoreless in the second half. Schwartz and Tynes dive into the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/giants-punish-andrew-thomas-over-violation-of-team-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andrew Thomas-Matt Peart</a> situation and what Judge and Thomas said after the game about it. They then look at the NFC East standings now and look ahead to Thursday&#8217;s game against the Eagles and make predictions. In this edition of &#8220;Tynes&#8217; Take,&#8221; he talks about how Giants fans should be happy despite the win being ugly.</p>

<p>Tynes and I are then joined by a fan favorite, a Super Bowl champion wide receiver, fashion guru and salsa legend Victor Cruz. This man has his hands in so many baskets &#8212; analyzing games for the Giants site, the Victor Cruz Foundation, E! Entertainment network and so much more. Cruz talks with us about the Giants&#8217; first win of the season, whether Slayton is a No. 1 receiver, if Daniel Jones is the franchise QB, Judge being the right guy as coach and the struggles in the red zone. No. 80 also talks about his overnight success and fame, that incredible 2011 year leading to the Super Bowl, his <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/15/victor-cruzs-99-yard-touchdown-became-giants-super-bowl-jumpstart/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NFL record 99-yard touchdown</a> and he tells us the best advice Tom Coughlin gave him. Cruuuuuuuuuz also gets into the lows in his career with the injuries that took a toll. He also talks about the salsa touchdown celebration and how it came about, Tynes as a teammate, all his jobs and setting himself up for success after his playing career. I also told him I&#8217;ve never felt uglier standing next to him in a suit.</p>

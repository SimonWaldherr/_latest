<div><p class="endmarkEnabled">Raw carrots make for quick and easy snacking, but this <a href="https://www.today.com/food/bittmans-three-ways-cook-root-vegetables-1D80361618" target="_blank">versatile root vegetable</a> can also be roasted, braised, steamed or sauteed &#8212; as well as baked into <a href="https://www.today.com/recipes/carrot-zucchini-mini-muffins-wbrp42896235" target="_blank">muffins</a>, quick breads and cakes. While they&#8217;re a year-round supermarket staple, carrots actually have a season, or two seasons to be precise.

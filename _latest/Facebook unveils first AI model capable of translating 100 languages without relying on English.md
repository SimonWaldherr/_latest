  Facebook unveils first AI model capable of translating 100 languages without relying on English 
description: > 
  Facebook unveiled software based on machine learning that is capable of translating 100 languages without relying on English as an intermediary step, as many systems currently do.Facebook's system, called M2M-100, was trained with a data set of 7.5 billion sentence pairs from 100 different languages and the team built the universal model with 15 billion parameters.It's new system is now capable of directly translating 100 languages in 100 different directions and achieved 10 BLEU, which is an algorithm for evaluating how well machine-translation performs.For instance, one group would include languages spoken in India, like Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Tamil, and Urdu,' Fan wrote.For example, Hindi, Bengali, and Tamil would be bridge languages for Indo-Aryan languages.

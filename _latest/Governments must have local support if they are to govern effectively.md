T here are many lessons to be learnt from the governmentâ€™s mishandling of the Covid-19 emergency: its use of scientific advice; its communications; the internal workings of the government machine; its strategy on public health; the entire decision-making process and so on. All this will need months of honest, sometimes uncomfortable, self-examination. This is the task for the joint parliamentary inquiry, led by two former Tory ministers, Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt, that was launched last week.

There is, however, some action that is needed right now, for one of the many things that has become clear is that the government is failing to bring large swathes of the country with it as it seeks to combat the second wave of the virus. It is not simply a question of poor explanation, or poor communication more generally. Nor is it a matter of London finding that the north is in revolt. Any part of the country that sees its economy savaged by the government response to the virus is likely to push back.

  Republicans vote through Amy Coney Barrett to full Senate floor vote despite Democrats boycotting 
description: > 
  Republicans voted Thursday to advance Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination for a full Senate floor vote with not a single Democrat showing up for the Judiciary Committee hearing.As Democrat senators' names were called out there was silence, opposed to the Republican members answering 'aye' when prompted with the motion to confirm Barrett's nomination.Graham moved forward with holding the vote to move Barrett's nomination to the Senate after Democrats announced the day before that they would boycott the proceedings.Nevertheless, the public protest will allow Senate Democrats to show fire as voters continue to cast their early votes and prepare for Election Day less than two weeks away.No Senate Democrats are expected to support Barrett's confirmation.

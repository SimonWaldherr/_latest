It takes an entire team to win a World Series title, but it never hurts to have some star power on the roster. Who's ready for some subjectivity?

1. Dodgers: Mookie Betts and Clayton Kershaw are two of the biggest names in the sport, and reigning NL MVP Cody Bellinger is a bona fide star as well despite an up and down 2020 season. Shortstop Corey Seager and right-hander Walker Buehler also belong among the game's elite, while guys like Max Muncy, Justin Turner and a resurgent A.J. Pollock reside on the fringe of this conversation.

2. Braves: The Braves have a trio of stars anchoring their high-powered offense in Ronald Acuna Jr., Freddie Freeman and Marcell Ozuna, and there's a case to be made for Dansby Swanson to fall into that category as well after he ranked sixth among all position players with 2.6 WAR this season. On the pitching side, Max Fried belongs in the star conversation as one of the game's most promising young arms.

3. Astros: Love them or hate them, George Springer, Alex Bregman and Carlos Correa are all star-caliber players. Veterans Jose Altuve and Zack Greinke have earned the moniker as well, though they have not exactly performed up to that level of late. Kyle Tucker is a rising star, and Michael Brantley is perennially one of the most underrated players in baseball.

4. Rays: The brightest star on the Tampa Bay roster right now is a 25-year-old outfielder with 42 games worth of MLB action to his credit in Randy Arozarena. Second baseman Brandon Lowe was on the path to stardom before going ice cold in October. On the pitching side, Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow have elite stuff and fit the bill when things are clicking, while Nick Anderson is the best reliever among the four teams left standing.

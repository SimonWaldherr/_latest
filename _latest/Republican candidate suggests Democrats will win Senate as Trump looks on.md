  Republican candidate suggests Democrats will win Senate as Trump looks on 
description: > 
  A Republican candidate appeared to suggest her party will lose the US Senate â€“ as Donald Trump looked on.Appointed Arizona Senator Martha McSally told a campaign rally for the president in Prescott that if her opponent Mark Kelly was elected he would give Democrats control of the upper chamber.Mr Trump looked on and made no comment as Ms McSally spoke.Despite polls suggesting he may lose the White House to Mr Biden and that the Senate is hanging in the balance, he has regularly insisted that the Republicans will easily hold both.Mr Kelly, the husband of former congresswoman Gabby Giffords who resigned after surviving an assassination attempt in 2011, has vastly out-raised Ms McSally in their race.

More than half the population of England is now living under increased Covid-19 restrictions, including rules on domestic travel, while curfews are coming into effect across Europe.

Pub-goers enjoyed a last night out in London on Friday before tier-two regulations came into force in the city – and several other areas of England – which prohibit different households from meeting indoors.

In Paris, people headed to bars and restaurants ahead of month-long restrictions for the capital and eight other French cities that will affect around 20 million people from Saturday.

Belgium, too, is set to impose a month-long curfew; Italy is also considering a nationwide curfew.

In the UK, restrictions now include a ban on people from high-risk areas of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland (which includes tiers two and three) visiting Wales and the start of a four-week "circuit breaker" lockdown in Northern Ireland.

UK holidays are at further risk as both teachers and the Government's testing tsar Sir John Bell have backed plans for a two-week half term, possibly to coincide with a “circuit breaker” lockdown.

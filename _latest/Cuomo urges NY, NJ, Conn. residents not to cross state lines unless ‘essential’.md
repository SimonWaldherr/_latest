<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday urged residents of New York and neighboring New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania to avoid all but essential travel between the states because of a spike in coronavirus cases in the Garden and Nutmeg states.</p>
<p>Cuomo said &#8220;non-essential&#8221; cross-border travel in the region &#8220;should be avoided&#8221; during a conference call with reporters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sticky situation because the three states had agreed to a regional travel advisory that requires residents of other states with high COVID-19 infections to quarantine upon arrival. New York also requires foreigners at airports to fill out contract tracing forms.</p>
<p>Any state that averages a 10 percent or higher positive infection rate on a seven-day rolling average, or if the number of positive cases recorded exceeds 10 for every 10,000 residents over seven days, are required to quarantine.</p>
<p>Cuomo said that New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennslyvannia are now among the 43 states that exceed the threshold &#8212; though he said their residents will not be required to quarantine upon entry to New York because there is too much commuting and commerce between the states.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now in a situation where 43 states are on our travel advisory. This is a really a bizarre outcome. New York had the highest infection rate. We now have 43 states on our quarantine list. It just shows you how different the situation is now,&#8221; Cuomo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Connecticut and New Jersey have seen spikes in infection. I&#8217;m gonna be speaking with the governors today about how we can help them with their spikes,&#8221; the governor said, adding he will be talking with the state&#8217;s governors later Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no practical way to quarantine New York from New Jersey and Connecticut. There&#8217;s just too many interchanges, too many interconnections, there are too many people that live in one place and work in the other,&#8221; Cuomo admitted.</p>
<p>He said imposing the quarantine on the neighboring states would have a &#8220;disastrous effect on the economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, there were 283,000 daily riders on the PATH train between New Jersey and New York &#8212; mostly residents commuting to their jobs in the other state. Thousands of others travel among the states via bridges and tunnels.</p>
 
<p>Violators of the travel advisory face up to $2,000 in fines if they refuse to comply with the 14-day isolation order following touchdown in New York. However, a Post analysis showed only <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/florida-man-only-traveler-busted-in-nyc-for-breaking-quarantine/">one Florida man</a> has ever been busted for violating the order.</p>
<p>Mark Anthony Perez, 51 of Miramar, Fla., faces $1,500 in fines, according to an arrest report from the New York City Sheriff&#8217;s Department after deputies showed up at his Midtown hotel on Sept. 18 and he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>The travel list now includes: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Guam, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.</p>

  Boris Johnson is picking fights with local leaders â€“ and losing them 
description: > 
  Boris Johnson has Jeremy Corbyn to thank for being played by the Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham, this week.If it hadn't been for the former Labour leader's hard-left takeover of the party, skilled politicians such as Mr Burnham would still be in Parliament rather than running Britain's major cities.The same can arguably also be said of Sadiq Khan, who stood down claiming to be "no patsy" to Mr Corbyn despite being among the 36 Labour MPs who nominated him as leader.So perhaps it is hardly surprising that Mr Johnson has been having problems reining in local Mayors who, without Corbynism, would most likely be sitting in the shadow Cabinet right now.Yet in losing control of the narrative around the three-tier system, as evidenced by the impassioned Mr Burnham's much-publicised press conference on Tuesday, the Government appears to be scoring a series of spectacular own goals.

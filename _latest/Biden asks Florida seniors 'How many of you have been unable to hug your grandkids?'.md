Joe Biden tailored a speech to Florida's seniors on Tuesday, pointing a finger at President Donald Trump for suggesting they're 'expendable' and blaming the president for why they can't see their grandkids.

'While he throws superspreader parties at the White House and Republicans hug each other without concern of the consequences, how many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months?' Biden asked a socially distanced group at a senior center in Pembroke Pines.

Biden recalled how Trump had once said the the coronavirus affects 'virtually nobody.'

'Who was he talking about when he said it affects "virtually nobody?" He was talking about America's seniors. He was talking about you. He was talking about my family,' Biden said. 'You're expendable, you're forgettable, you're "virtually nobody," that's how he sees seniors, that's how he sees you.'

The risk for serious illness from the coronavirus goes up with age.

Democratic nominee Joe Biden went after President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis by asking seniors, 'How many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months?'

'The only senior that Donald Trump cares about, the only senior is senior Donald Trump,' the 77-year-old Biden said about the 74-year-old Trump.

'It's become painfully clear that his careless, arrogant, reckless COVID response has caused one of the worst tragedies in American history,' the former vice president said.

When Biden talked about his own grandkids he got tangled up over his words, editing himself to explain that of the six of them the late Beau Biden's two children, a boy and a girl, lived nearby - Natalie and Robert.

'They can walk through the woods. That's the only way I can see them. I stand on the back porch. They stand down and I bribe them with HÃ¤agen-Dazs bars,' Biden said. 'Every single day I contact them.'

'I can't hug them, I can't embrace them,' he continued.

'I'm luckier than most because they're nearby, those two of the six,' the Democratic nominee added.

Biden was able to be near his grandkids during the Democratic National Convention, which was held 'virtually' in Wilmington, Delaware, as they appeared alongside him the night Jill Biden spoke. They celebrated after their grandfather officially became the Democratic nominee.

'My grandkids, your grandkids, I hope will grow up to treat each other with kindness, respect and empathy, qualities the president has never, ever shown,' Biden also said.

The ex-veep also remarked that the president's own coronavirus diagnosis hasn't made him a changed man.

'His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable,' Biden said. 'The longer Donald Trump is president the more reckless he seems to get.'

'Thank God we only have three weeks left to go,' he added.

Joe Biden also spoke at a drive-in event in nearby Miramar, Florida, where supporters stayed in their cars and honked their horns in approval at the Democratic nominee

Biden toured Florida the day after the president returned to the campaign trail post-COVID and held a mega-rally in the state. There he told a packed-in crowd that he wanted to kiss them and announced he was 'immune' from the coronavirus.

Biden also made a stop Tuesday in nearby Miramar, Florida, where he held another drive-in movie-style event, where the crowd honked their horns in agreement.

The Trump campaign laughed off Biden's play for Florida, pointing out that his two Tuesday stops were in the Democratic-friendly Broward County.

Broward went for Hillary Clinton over Trump 66.1 to 31.2 per cent in 2016.

Trump, by contrast, went to the more competitive Seminole County Monday night, for a rally at the Orlando Sanford International Airport.

That county went to Trump 48.1 per cent to Clinton's 46.6. per cent.

Clinton performed better in Broward than in nearby Miami-Dade.

And overall, it was her second best showing in Florida, the first being Gadsden County outside of Tallahassee.

But the Democratic play in Florida is to drive up turnout in reliable counties.

Former Democratic presidential candidate and billionaire Micheal Bloomberg is donating $500,000 to the Miami-Dade County Democratic Party to boost Biden's chances of winning the state.

Florida, with its 29 Electoral College votes, is essentially a must-win for the president.

He's returning to the state Friday for another rally, before he travels to Macon, Georgia to shore up support there.

Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Tuesday declined to answer questions about where she stands on landmark Supreme Court precedents related to abortion and LGBTQ rights as well as refusing to say whether she'd recuse herself from the upcoming case involving the Affordable Care Act.

When nominated to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett said she embodies the "judicial philosophy" of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. But she sidestepped questions at Tuesday's confirmation hearing about whether she agrees with her former boss and mentor's opinions in high-profile cases on abortion and same-sex marriage. Scalia believed the 1973 case Roe v. Wade that legalized abortions was "wrongly decided." And in 2015, he dissented in the case Obergefell v. Hodges, which ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry under the Constitution.

Barrett, who currently serves on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, faces four days of confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Tuesday's marathon hearing features the first round of senators' questions and had a noticeably low-key tone compared to the contentious confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh two years earlier. While Democrats asked pointed questions about hot-button issues, the interactions were cordial.

"If I express a view on a precedent one way or another ... it signals to litigants I might tilt one way or another in a pending case," Barrett said in response to questions posed by Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein of California. "I can't pre-commit or say yes, I'm going in with some agenda because I'm not. I don't have any agenda."

"I have no agenda to try to overrule Casey. I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come," Barrett added, referring to the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld Roe v. Wade and established the "undue burden" standard.

Feinstein expressed disappointment that Barrett wouldn't directly answer questions particularly on the issue of LGBTQ rights, adding that she was "hoping you'd say that this would be a point of difference" from Scalia.

"You identify yourself with a justice that you, like him, would be a consistent vote to roll back hard-fought freedoms and protections for the LGBT community," Feinstein said.

Pressed repeatedly about her views on court precedents, Barrett invoked past statements from Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan for Supreme Court nominees to not give indications of where they stand on certain issues and precedents. Citing it as the Ginsburg rule, Barrett said, "No hints, no previews, no forecasts." But Feinstein noted that during Ginsburg's 1993 confirmation hearing, the late justice was unequivocal about her views on the Constitution protecting a woman's right to an abortion.

Barrett, a devout Catholic, signed onto a 2006 anti-abortion ad in her hometown newspaper in Indiana that called for overturning Roe v. Wade's "barbaric legacy." Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont noted that the group that ran the ad has characterized in-vitro fertilization as "manslaughter," and he pressed Barrett on whether she believes it should be criminalized. Barrett said she signed the ad on the way out from church and that she took "no position" on IVF.

Throughout the confirmation process, Democrats have sought to put a spotlight on the Affordable Care Act case that'll come before the Supreme Court on Nov. 10, one week after Election Day. They have cited fears that a justice appointed by President Donald Trump will threaten the fate of the law as well as protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The lawsuit, which is supported by the Trump administration, argues that because the individual mandate was invalidated by Congress, the entire law should be dismantled.

Democrats on the committee questioned whether Barrett would recuse herself from the ACA case, but she demurred. Barrett said recusal is a "legal issue" and one that she can't answer "in the abstract."

Some Democrats pointed to her past criticism of Chief Justice John Roberts' rulings on two big ACA cases. But she countered that the cases dealt with different issues related to the health care law and not on the current challenge before the court â€“ whether the individual mandate can be "severed" from the ACA and have the law still stand. She challenged Democratic notions that she's "hostile" to the ACA because of her critiques of Roberts' past ACA interpretations.

Faced with a barrage of questions about identifying with an ultra-conservative justice, Barrett sought to cast herself as an independent thinker and jurist even as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina asked about being called a "female Scalia." Barrett repeated that if she's confirmed, "You'd be getting a Justice Barrett, not a Justice Scalia." Barrett characterizes herself as an "originalist" who interprets the Constitution based on how it was initially intended and written.

Democrats repeatedly cited Trump's intention to nominate justices that will overturn the Affordable Care Act. And Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, has said he'll confirm justices who believe Roe v. Wade was "wrongly decided." But Barrett pushed back that she's "made no commitment" to the White House or any senators about how she'd rule in any cases.

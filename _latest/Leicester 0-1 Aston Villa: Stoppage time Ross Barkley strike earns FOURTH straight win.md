<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Less&#160;&#160;than three months after avoiding relegation by a single point, Aston Villa can go top of the Premier League if they avoid defeat by Leeds on Friday after a remarkable turnaround in fortunes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ross Barkley&#8217;s glorious stoppage-time strike sealed their fourth consecutive victory and should make people sit up and take notice just as much as the 7-2 triumph over champions Liverpool a fortnight ago. They now have the only 100 per cent record in the top five leagues in England.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barkley ran to celebrate with club doctor Ricky Shamji after boss Dean Smith revealed the player had not trained until Saturday due to a knee problem.

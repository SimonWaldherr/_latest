It is "very likely" that local areas in the North West will face further restrictions, MPs representing the region have been told in a letter from Downing Street, ahead of further discussions between the Government and northern leaders this afternoon.

While the measures are expected to be tier three - meaning that pubs, restaurants and hairdressers could be closed - the mayor of Liverpool said that he expects restaurants will be allowed to stay open until 10pm.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, he said: "We will be in the local lockdown, new local lockdown, which is announced, which will probably be, well, will be tier three, and that that will be enacted in Parliament on Tuesday.

"We are continuing the discussions and conversations today."

He added: "Now we are engaged in a conversation that's telling us that these decisions have been made, so that's... a conversation, not a consultation.

"But the main point of the imposition of the measures are clearly that: imposition. We have not be consulted."

Mr Anderson said that he believes the measures that will be introduced will be a lockdown of public houses from Wednesday within the city of Liverpool and beyond in "terms of the whole [North West] region".

However, he believes there "will be a concession" where restaurants will be allowed to stay open until 10pm.

Liverpool is currently seeing 600 cases per 100,000 people - far higher than England's average - and hospital admissions of Covid-19 cases in the North West are the highest in England.

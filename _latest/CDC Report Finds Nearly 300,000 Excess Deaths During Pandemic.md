  CDC Report Finds Nearly 300,000 Excess Deaths During Pandemic 
description: > 
  Nearly 300,000 more Americans died from late January to early October than expected during an average year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in a report published Tuesday.The majority of the excess deaths – 66% – are due to the coronavirus, the report found.Examining the estimates "can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19," the report said.While younger people are less likely to die from COVID-19 than older populations, the percentage increase in excess deaths reinforces that it can still happen."These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality," the report said.

Although more deaths from all causes occured in older populations, the highest average percent increase (26.5%) in the number of fatalities relative to previous years was among adults aged 25-44 years.</p><p>The report noted that COVID-19 deaths did become more prevalent among a younger population from May through August, but it said that the excess death increase for this age group "might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death." </p><p>"Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death," the report said.</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Photos: Daily Life, Disrupted</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/a0eb38c/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F29%2Fad%2F7c51afd846059305620685f70460%2Fcoronavirus-03.JPG" alt="TOPSHOT - A passenger in an outfit (R) poses for a picture as a security guard wearing a facemask as a preventive measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus stands nearby on a last century-style boat, featuring a theatrical drama set between the 1920s and 1930s in Wuhan, in Chinas central Hubei province on September 27, 2020.

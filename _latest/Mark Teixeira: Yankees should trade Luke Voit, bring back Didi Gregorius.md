One former Yankees first baseman thinks Brian Cashman should move on from the team’s current one.

Mark Teixeira, who was 29 when he played the first year of his eight-year, $180 million deal with the Yankees in 2009, is in favor of the team trading 29-year-old Luke Voit, believing the Yankees are better off spending their money on re-signing DJ LeMahieu and/or bringing back shortstop Didi Gregorius.

“As good as Luke Voit is, and as popular as he is, his value has never been higher,” said Teixeira, appearing on “The Michael Kay Show.”

Voit, who would have made just $634,000 if a full 2020 season was played, proved to be one of baseball’s best bargains this year, leading the majors with 22 home runs in 56 games, while hitting .277 with 52 RBIs and a .948 OPS. However, this offseason, the former 22nd-round pick will be eligible for salary arbitration for the first time.

Teixeira placed a greater emphasis on the Yankees re-signing the 32-year-old LeMahieu — who will be a free agent after finishing his two-year, $24 million deal with the Yankees — calling it a “no-brainer” to bring back the holder of baseball’s best batting average (.364) this season. Part of Teixeira’s reasoning is allowing Gleyber Torres to return to second base “because he’s not a great defensive shortstop.”

Teixeira knows someone who is, though.

“Go back out and re-sign Didi Gregorius,” Teixeira said. “Because we know Didi can play in New York. He’s a good defensive shortstop and he’s left-handed. I think that’s the move you make this offseason.”

After five years with the Yankees, Gregorius, 30, spent this season with the Phillies, batting .284 with 10 home runs and an .827 OPS.

Of course, Teixeira’s plan hinges on the Yankees being able to afford LeMahieu, who could land a nine-figure contract.

“I don’t know what the financial situation of the Yankees is going to be this offseason,” Teixeira said. “If Brian Cashman has a very small budget, then maybe DJ LeMahieu is out of their budget. But if the Steinbrenner family says, ‘Hey, I know we lost a ton of money this year, everybody in baseball lost money this year, but I’m still going to let you go out and sign a few guys, Cash, and we need to bring back the value’ — then of course it’s a no-brainer.”

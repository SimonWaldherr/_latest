  And while we are talking about the effect of our actions on others, perhaps you are familiar with the principle of hillul hashem — the public desecration of God’s name.Your actions have implications for all Jews — we are bound together in good times and in bad.It is part of the reason why I marched with my Manhattan synagogue last year when anti-Semitism reared its ugly head in your Brooklyn community.Before taking to the streets tonight, perhaps you will pause to consider how your decision will ripple across an already fraught social landscape.

<div><p>Country folk like to drive their Subaru Foresters very fast. I&#8217;m not sure why: the excitement of the open road, the uneventfulness of daily life, the opportunity to paralyse a walker obliged to use the tarmac in order to get to the next stile? &#160;</p>
<p>My home town, Totnes &#8211; which prides itself on (at least the media loves to bestow upon it), a rustic, organic, nature-loving brand-image &#8211; is strewn with rat-runs, lanes littered with blind bends and summits, and throbbing bypasses. While I have logged some pleasurable semi-suburban hikes during lockdown, for me to travel on foot to the beach at Paignton &#8211; only five miles away &#8211; I&#8217;d have to brave long stretches of murderous hedgerow-shadowed back roads or else embark on a meandering tramp through clay-clodding fields of sheep, bulls and men in wax jackets aiming things at birds.&#160;</p>
<p>Or so I&#8217;d thought.&#160;</p>
<p>The real obstacle is a lack of information, according to Dan Raven-Ellison, who is developing a walker-friendly map of the whole of Great Britain &#8211; and needs volunteers to help him join the dots.</p>
<p>Raven-Ellison, from Hanwell, West London, had the idea while walking across all of Britain&#8217;s cities and national parks for an earlier project.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;ve walked across as much as the UK as I have, you see all that&#8217;s good and all that could be better about our footpaths. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a kind of epiphanic moment on a walk from Salisbury to Winchester, on the Pilgrims&#8217; Way, when I realised a lot of people were perfectly happy doing 20- or even 30-kilometre walks for recreational purposes but that we had lost the culture of using footpaths to visit family or friends or to get to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slow Ways, launched earlier this year &#8211; and itself slowed by the summer lockdown &#8211; wants to reclaim walking as a mode of transport as well as a leisure activity. Focused on Britain for now, Raven-Ellison also has plans for Ireland and international walking maps; later on, routes for cyclists and horseback riders, and even kayakers, can be added. &#160;</p>

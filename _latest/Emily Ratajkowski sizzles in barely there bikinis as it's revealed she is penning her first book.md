Emily Ratajkowski is poised to pen her very first book, titled My Body, which will be a collection of essays about 'what it means to be a woman'.

The 29-year-old model has partnered with Metropolitan Books, an imprint at the Henry Hold Company, to author the upcoming book which was announced on Friday.

Meanwhile, that same day, the star's Inamorata line shared new photos of the actress entrepreneur modeling their satin swimsuit collection.

Author: Emily Ratajkowski is poised to pen her very first book, titled My Body, which will be a collection of essays about 'what it means to be a woman,' the publisher announced on Friday

The book deal comes after the activist wrote a powerful magazine essay last month where she claimed that she was sexually assaulted by a photographer during a nude shoot at his home in the Catskills in 2012.

'In her first book, Ratajkowski will expand her deeply personal examination of what it means to be a woman and a commodity, touching on themes of feminism, sexuality, men's treatment of women and women's rationalizations for accepting that treatment,' read a press release.

My Body will be an expansion of her devastatingly personal essay, Buying Myself Back, written for The Cut last month, where she accused photographer Jonathan Leder of assault.

The piece, which garnered numerous headlines, recounted her experience after an unpaid editorial shoot arranged by her agent at the time at Leder's home.

She revealed that he put his 'fingers inside of her' without her consent while they were sitting together on his couch.

When contacted by The Cut, Leder denied Ratajkowski's allegations, telling the publication that they were 'too tawdry and childish to respond to'.

Referring to nude and topless shoots that Ratajkowski has done in the years since he worked with her, Leder continued: 'You do know who we are talking about right? This is the girl that was naked in Treats! magazine, and bounced around naked in the Robin Thicke video at that time. You really want someone to believe she was a victim?'

In a statement made to DailyMail.com, Leder insisted that Ratajkowski's claims about the shoot are 'totally false'.

Despite Leder's denials, Emily has gotten support from friends and fans for her vulnerability in sharing her side of the story.

'Emily Ratajkowski reveals herself to be devastatingly honest, nuanced, and strong – I'm not surprised that she thinks of herself first as a writer,' said Sara Bershtel, the publisher of Emily's upcoming book.

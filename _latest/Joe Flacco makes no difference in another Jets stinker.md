New quarterback, same result.

Joe Flacco got his first start as a Jet on Sunday against the Cardinals but could not lead the team to its first victory of the season. Arizona won a sleepy affair at MetLife Stadium, 30-10.

The loss drops the dismal Jets to 0-5. It is the third time in franchise history the team has lost its first five games. The team also started 0-5 in 1980 and in 1996. They went 1-15 in 1996, the worst season in franchise history — a mark these Jets look like they will threaten.

Flacco got the start in place of Sam Darnold, who has a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder. Flacco did some good things, but not enough to carry the Jets. He finished 18 of 33 for 195 yards and one touchdown.

Jets coach Adam Gase’s seat is not cooling off. His offense managed to score just one touchdown for the fourth time in five games. His team got stuffed on third-and-1 three times and once on fourth-and-1. They punted twice on fourth-and-1 and once on fourth-and-2.

The touchdown came in the third quarter and gave a little hope. Flacco hit Jamison Crowder for an 11-yard score that made it 17-10 and gave some brief belief they could come back. The Cardinals ended that with a 10-play, 70-yard drive, running the ball right down the Jets’ throats. Unlike the Jets, the Cardinals converted a fourth-and-1 on the drive, a pretty pass from Kyler Murray to tight end Darrell Daniels. Kenyan Drake scored from the 1 to make it 24-10.

If there were fans in the seats, they would have been heading for the exits.

The Cardinals added one more touchdown to put a punctuation mark on the win. Murray found DeAndre Hopkins for a 37-yard touchdown with 8:42 left in the game to put Arizona up 30-10. This was the fourth straight game the Jets allowed at least 30 points.

Murray set a career high with 380 passing yards. He also ran for 31 yards. The Cardinals had 500 total yards before losing a few when they took a knee at the end of the game.

The Jets offense was without Darnold but did get back running back Le’Veon Bell, who had 13 rushes for 60 yards and one catch for 7 yards.

The Flacco-led offense looked an awful lot like the Darnold-led offense early. The Jets went three-and-out on their first two series and punted on their first three. The first two punts came on fourth-and-1 and fourth-and-2 inside their own territory.

Those punts may have been on Gase’s mind in the second quarter when the Jets mounted a 14-play drive but stalled at the Cardinals’ 13. Gase went for it on fourth-and-1, but Bell was stuffed by Cardinals linebacker De’Vondre Campbell to end the long drive with no points. That stop came after a third-and-1 handoff to fullback Trevon Wesco that was stuffed.

The Jets finally got on the board after linebacker Avery Williamson intercepted Murray to give the offense the ball at the Arizona 10. That unit could not reach the end zone, of course, but a 26-yard field goal from Sam Ficken cut the Cardinals’ lead to 7-3.

While the offense sputtered, the defense struggled to get pressure on Murray, fearing he would run past them. Chase Edmonds gave the Cardinals a 7-0 lead with a 29-yard touchdown run through the middle of the Jets defense. The scoring drive included a 16-yard run by Murray.

Murray put the Cards up 14-3 on a 2-yard touchdown run with 2:46 left in the first half. The score capped a 10-play, 75-yard drive. The Jets defense did not commit killer penalties this week, but gave up some big runs.

The Jets gave the Cardinals the ball back with a minute left in the half after Flacco was sacked. Arizona moved down the field efficiently and Zane Gonzalez kicked a 47-yard field goal to give the Cardinals a 17-3 halftime lead.

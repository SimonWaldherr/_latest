<div><p>Ah, we love designer collaborations. Great quality and chic catwalk-worthy designs, but with a much more accessible price point? You don&#8217;t need to tell us twice. This autumn, there are plenty to choose from. The only thing to note? You need to move fast, they won&#8217;t hang around long...</p>
<h3>The set-your-clock&#160;one: The Vampire&#8217;s Wife x H&amp;M</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/susie-cave-life-nick-rise-rise-fashion-brand-vampires-wife/">Susie Cave&#8217;s label The Vampire&#8217;s Wife</a> was born in 2014, and her line of modest&#160;yet modern , vintage-esque dresses has been a hit ever since. The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/royals/duchess-cambridge-no-longer-reluctant-embrace-fashion-proven/">Duchess of Cambridge,</a> Cate Blanchett and Sienna Miller are all fans, but its steep price tags (up to &#163;2,500) have meant it&#8217;s been out of reach for many of us.</p>
<p>Enter H&amp;M, famed for its fabulous collabs that have queues snaking up the high street on launch day, which has tapped The Vampire&#8217;s Wife for its next big one.

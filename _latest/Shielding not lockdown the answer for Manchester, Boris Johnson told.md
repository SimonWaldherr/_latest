<div><p>The plan was backed by senior Conservatives in the area including Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, who said there was no scientific basis for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/14/three-tier-lockdown-what-new-system-covid-rules-explained/">the tier system</a>.</p>
<p>Sir Graham, the MP for Altrincham and Sale West, said the proposal should not be "dismissed out of hand", adding: "The fundamental point about Tier 3 is the proposals don't appear to have any evidential basis. There is no reason to think that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/news/pubs-close-again-tier-2-lockdown-covid-rules-areas-uk/">closing some pubs and bars</a> would have a significant impact on the spread on the virus."</p>
<p>He was joined by James Daly, the Tory MP for Bury North, who said he was "extremely sympathetic" to Sir Richard's proposal, and Chris Green, the Tory MP for Bolton West, who said: "I think this is a good direction of travel. Let's keep our hospitality running up to Christmas and support people at home if they are deemed vulnerable."</p>
<p>William Wragg, the Tory MP for Hazel Grove, said: "I think Richard Leese's proposal has merit and should be properly considered." &#160;</p>
<p>Sir Richard said: "Most people who test positive for the virus are not getting particularly ill. They are not the problem", pointing out&#160;that those most at risk of hospitalisation were older people and those with existing underlying conditions, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure or respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>"If this is the evidence, wouldn't it be much better to have an effective shielding programme for those most at risk, rather than have a blanket business closure policy of dubious efficacy?" he said.</p>
<p>But a Government spokesman said: "It would be completely wrong and unfair to try and lock up the elderly and vulnerable while allowing coronavirus to spread freely. It is also not practical, when so many people live with elderly relatives and when older people need carers to look after them."</p>
<p>Downing Street claimed on Monday that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/manchester-hospital-capacity-will-overwhelmed-three-weeks-says/">Manchester's hospitals would be overwhelmed within three weeks</a> if the area did not have tighter restrictions imposed.&#160;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's spokesman said cases among over-60s had tripled between September 28 and October 12, and that every intensive care bed in the area would be filled with Covid patients by November 8.</p>

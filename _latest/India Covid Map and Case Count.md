India is one of many developing nations where leaders feel they have no choice but to prioritize reopenings and accept the risks of surging coronavirus infections. Yet its public health system is severely strained, and experts believe it is likely to reach a breaking point as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government continues to ease a nationwide lockdown.

Initially, the country took some of the strictest measures anywhere to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including placing all 1.3 billion citizens under a nationwide lockdown. But the measures were brutally hard on the poorest Indians. Some of the restrictions were lifted in early May to help revive the economy, including allowing construction and plantation work to resume and many shops to reopen.

When Mr. Modi announced the lockdown, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers were initially stranded in cities without a way to reach their home villages. Some started long journeys on foot. Most headed back to the countryside because they couldn't afford the rent or food without work in the cities, and that just spread the virus across the larger swaths of the country.

How Cases Are Growing

Here’s how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:

New reported cases by day in India 0 50,000 cases Feb. March April May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. New cases 7-day average Note: The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data.

New reported deaths by day in India 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 deaths Feb. March April May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. New deaths 7-day average Note: Scale for deaths chart is adjusted from cases chart to display trend.

The New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

India’s lockdown was largely considered effective, and it was widely obeyed. But with the measures largely lifted, anxiety is rising as the caseload surges, and more people have complained that they have been unable to find hospital beds.

India’s total caseload has become the world’s second-largest. So far, a large chunk of India’s Covid-19 cases have come from five states: Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, followed by Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.

Public health experts have warned that the country’s testing figures were still far too restricted. But capacity has been rising: On September 3, more than 1,172,000 samples were tested in 24 hours, taking the total number of samples tested so far to 45,509,380.

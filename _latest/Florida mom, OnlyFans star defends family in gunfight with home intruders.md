<div><p>An Instagram model may have saved her family when she grabbed a firearm and engaged in a gunfight&#160;with masked intruders who stormed into her Florida home, reports said.</p>
<p>Ansley Pacheco, 26, was at home in Miami-Dade County earlier this month when armed intruders ambushed her husband, 7-year-old son and their friends, <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/10/21/mother-gabs-gun-defends-family-after-armed-intruders-stormed-her-miami-dade-home/">according to Local 10 News</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I was in the bathroom, I started to hear the commotion, I started hearing, &#8216;Get down, get down, give me everything you got,&#8217;&#8221; she recalled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to the nightstand; I grabbed the gun and I opened the door. I saw one if they guys face to face with me. He told me to put my gun down. I just shook my head no, and then I said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t shoot me, my son is in here.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>After a tussle and gunshots, which were caught on surveillance video, the intruders took off with some watches and jewelry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;They finally just ran out,&#8221; Pacheco said. &#8220;My husband ran and got the gun and shot back at the vehicle that was leaving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily, Pacheco and her family were not injured in the melee. The woman, who streams videos on the website OnlyFans, remained defiant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just knew that I had to do something, and my first instinct was to grab the gun and defend my husband and my son,&#8221; she said.</p>

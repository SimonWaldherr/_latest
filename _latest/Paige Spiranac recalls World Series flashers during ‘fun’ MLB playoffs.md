Paige Spiranac is savoring every moment of the MLB postseason.

Fresh off a Twitter war with Padres fans, the golfer-turned-influencer appeared to catch Game 5 of the ALDS on Friday, when the Tampa Bay Rays ended the Yankees’ season in heartbreaking fashion. Spiranac told followers she’s enjoying the playoffs despite the absence of some topless fans.

“This has been the most fun I’ve had watching baseball since I saw some boobies last year,” Spiranac tweeted Friday night.

Last October, Julia Rose and Lauren Summer were banned indefinitely after flashing then-Astros pitcher and current Yankees ace Gerrit Cole during Game 5 of the World Series against the Nationals.

“It was one of the top moments of my life,” Rose previously told The Post. “I’m still banned from any baseball games, but it’s worth it. I’ve always chased adrenaline.”

As for Spiranac, while the Rays are her World Series pick this year, she favors another storyline.

“Rays but I want to see Astros vs Dodgers because drama,” she tweeted Friday.

The Rays face the Astros on Sunday in Game 1 of the ALCS.

President Donald Trump said Thursday he may hold campaign rallies this weekend in Florida and Pennsylvania, an announcement that comes a week after he tested positive for COVID-19 as part of a larger White House coronavirus outbreak.

Hours before he told Fox News his plans, White House physician Sean Conley cleared the president to resume public events, saying he had completed his therapy of COVID-19. Trump and the administration have repeatedly declined to say to when the president last received a negative test. That continued Thursday.

"There's no reason to test all the time, but they found very little infection or virus, if any," Trump told Fox. "I don't know that they found any, I didn't go into it greatly with the doctors."

Meanwhile, the next presidential debate appears up-in-the-air after Trump said he wouldn't participate because organizers changed the Miami event to a virtual platform over COVID-19 concerns. The Commission on Presidential Debates said it wouldn't hold the debate Thursday with just Biden. Trump's team now wants each of the remaining debates moved back a week, an idea the Biden campaign rejected.

COVID stimulus update: Mixed signals emerge on talks as 2 sides meet

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to talk Friday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as mixed signals emerged on the state of COVID-19 stimulus negotiations.

Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday that President Donald Trump had approved a ‚Äúrevised‚Äù stimulus package, though he declined to provide details. Kudlow has not been part of negotiations so far, which have largely involved Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Mnuchin.

Shortly after, Trump tweeted, ‚ÄúCovid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!‚Äù

Pelosi said on MSNBC Friday she would talk more with Mnuchin as they worked through differences on funding amounts and on policy in the bill. Negotiations have deadlocked over provisions like funding for state and local governments and the dollar amount for a federal unemployment benefit boost. ‚ÄúI do hope we will have an agreement soon,‚Äù she said.

The optimism comes three days after Trump abruptly rejected a recent Democratic proposal and saying he wanted to postpone any negotiations until after the November election. Since then, Trump has reversed course, saying he wanted standalone bills to send out stimulus checks and provide relief to airlines.

Any negotiated deal, however, will have to pass through the Republican-controlled Senate, where members have expressed hesitancy at spending trillions of dollars on COVID-19 relief.

At an event in Kentucky Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù a stimulus deal would occur before the election.

25th Amendment: Dems. pitch bill on POTUS succession, citing Trump's COVID diagnosis

House Democrats unveiled legislation Friday to establish rules for presidential succession, citing President Donald Trump's recent COVID-19 diagnosis and the outbreak among top administration officials.

The legislation would set up a 16-member bipartisan commission comprised of doctors and former administration officials to conduct a medical exam of the president and evaluate the fitness of the president for office.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters the process was not directed at Trump and was intended to clarify the procedure for future presidents.

The Democrats' legislation would address a provision of the 25th Amendment to determine that the president is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office." Congress has never acted on the provision.

The 25th Amendment, ratified in 1967, lays out a legal mechanism for designating a head of state if the president is disabled or dead and also formalized the line of succession for the vice president to take over if the president dies or resigns.

COVID stimulus update: McConnell says deal 'unlikely' before election

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Friday he thinks it's unlikely Congress will "rise above" and pass any kind of coronavirus stimulus legislation before the Nov. 3 election.

Congressional leaders in the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democrat-run House of Representatives both say another stimulus package is needed as Americans grapple with the health and economic fallout from the ongoing pandemic, but they've failed to reach a compromise.

But McConnell, while at an event in Kentucky, expressed doubt Congress could reach an agreement before the election.

"I just think the situation's kind of murky, and I think the murkiness is a result of the proximity to the election and everybody kind of trying to elbow for political advantage," he said. "I'd like to see us rise above that like we did back in March and April, but I think that's unlikely in the next three weeks."

Trump says he‚Äôs considering rallies this weekend

President Donald Trump said Thursday he may hold rallies this weekend in Florida and Pennsylvania, hours after his physicians said he would be cleared to return to the campaign trail on Saturday.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to try doing a rally on Saturday night, probably in Florida on Saturday,‚Äù the president told Fox News, breaking his answer at one point to clear his throat. ‚ÄúPennsylvania the following night.‚Äù

White House physician Sean Conley said Thursday the president had completed his course of therapy for COVID-19 "as prescribed by his team of physicians" and cleared the president to return to public life on Saturday, 10 days since his diagnosis.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines say patients are supposed to quarantine for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms ‚Äì in Trump's case, last Thursday.

Earlier on Thursday Trump said he would bow out of the second presidential debate, scheduled for Oct. 15, after the Commission on Presidential Debates said they would hold a virtual debate out of coronavirus safety concerns.

6 charged in plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Whitmer

A team of militia operatives is charged with conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in a plot in which they considered storming the state Capitol in a commando raid that would use Molotov cocktails to keep police cars at bay, according to newly unsealed court records.

Members of the group bought weapons, conducted surveillance, held training and planning meetings, but they were foiled in part because the FBI infiltrated the group with informants, according to a criminal complaint. Six were charged with federal kidnapping offenses and at least seven others face state charges.

The FBI became aware early in 2020, through social media, that a militia group was "discussing the violent overthrow of certain government and law enforcement components" and "agreed to take violent action," according to a sworn affidavit.

McConnell says he hasn't visited White House because of lax COVID rules

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday said he hasn't visited the White House in two months because of what he saw as lax coronavirus practices.

"My impression was their approach to how to handle this (pandemic) was different from mine and what I insisted we do in the Senate, which was to wear a mask and practice social distancing,'' McConnell said during an appearance in Northern Kentucky.

McConnell said he maintains regular phone contact with Trump and that the president "seems perfectly fine.''

But McConnell said he doesn't have first-hand knowledge of the president's health condition because he hasn't visited the White House since Aug. 6. McConnell was not at the Sept. 26 event in the Rose Garden announcing Trump's Supreme Court nominee - which may have become a "superspreader" event.

Trump says he won't do next debate after it goes virtual

President Donald Trump said Thursday he would not take part in the next presidential debate Oct. 15 with former Vice President Joe Biden after it was moved to a virtual format because of COVID-19 safety concerns.

"I'm not going to waste my time doing a virtual debate," he told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, calling it a "joke" and an effort "to protect Biden."

The Commission on Presidential Debates announced Thursday morning the next debate would be remote to "protect the health and safety of all involved" after Trump's positive COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent White House outbreak.

Co-chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the commission would not host a debate with Biden alone if Trump doesn‚Äôt budge. He said the future of the debate rests with Trump: "The ball's in his court."

The Trump campaign later said they want to push the remaining two debates back one week each, an idea Biden's team rejected.

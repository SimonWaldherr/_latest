TikTok is full of creative ways to make coffee, but a new video shows what might be the most satisfying method yet.

The short video, posted by vegan chef and fitness instructor Katie Lopynski, shows a neat and easy way to make a cinnamon coffee iced latte.

Lopynski starts the recipe with coffee, frozen into dozens of tiny ice cubes, which she calls "coffee ice." Next comes a generous serving of oat milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Stir the mixture up with a straw to blend the flavors, and you're all set.

"Coffee ice" is far from the first coffee-related hack to come out of TikTok during the pandemic. In March 2020, whipped coffee took over the platform as users mixed instant coffee, sugar and hot water into a cloud-like concoction. The frothy recipe quickly evolved to include strawberry and peanut butter-flavored versions.

Other food trends on the social media platform have included cloud bread, a keto-friendly, magical-looking treat that can be made with just three ingredients, and pancake cereal, an extremely time-intensive but beautiful breakfast. For bakers who are really looking to get outside their comfort zone, there's "froggy bread," a delightful, amphibian-shaped loaf.

Some more practical recipes have also seen a revival while people spend more time at home, like Depression cake, a rich chocolate cake that was initially popularized during the Great Depression and can be made without milk, butter or eggs. Another TikTok video explained how to make a quick and easy creme brûlée with just a handful of basic ingredients.

<p>Abdulhadi el Hadi said the guy behind the wheel of a green Honda Accord cut him off in Dearborn, Michigan, on Sunday afternoon&#160; &#8212; so he began recording video as he pulled alongside the driver to confront him, according to news agency Storyful.</p>
<p>Footage first obtained by Storyful shows the Honda&#8217;s driver brandishing a handgun as El Hadi can be heard twice pleading with him to &#8220;put your gun down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The triggerman then levels his weapon at el Hadi&#8217;s white pickup truck and opens fire, before driving off with the gun&#8217;s muzzle still smoking, the clip shows.</p>
<p>El Hadi was not injured, but he took images of apparent bullet holes in the driver&#8217;s side door and window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckless acts such as this endanger innocent lives and will not be tolerated,&#8221; Dearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad said on Twitter.</p>
<p>The suspect remains at large, cops said.</p>

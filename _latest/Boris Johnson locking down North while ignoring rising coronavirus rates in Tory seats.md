Boris Johnson has been blasted for hitting the North with lockdowns while doing nothing about soaring Covid cases in his London constituency.

And he wasn’t the only top Tory to feel the heat for dodging tighter restrictions in his own backyard that might upset constituents.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and housing chief Robert Jenrick were among others slammed for ignoring rising rates on their patches – and helping create a new North-South divide.

Now some of the Tories’ new MPs are threatening rebellion as furious constituents feel abandoned by the party they switched to.

A day of Covid anger exploded as:

Labour leader Keir Starmer accused the Prime Minister of “serial incompetence” over his handling of the second wave crisis.

A British Medical Association expert called for restrictions to be more “evenly spread”.

The UK infection rate keeps rising, with millions more set to join the

10 million locked down.

10 million locked down. Northern leaders claimed people wouldn’t obey new measures in lockdown areas as rates were already falling.

Covid cases continue to soar across Europe, now engulfed by the second wave. Meanwhile, here the PM’s cronies still feel using “common sense” is enough advice for their constituents.

Yet the figures show this approach doesn’t add up.

In July the 287,000 people who live in Bolton, Lancs – represented by one Labour MP and two Red Wall Tories – were hit with a local lockdown when the rate was just 26.79 per 100,000.

Bury, now with two Conservative MPs, went the same way with 30.37.

But Labour analysis shows Boris Johnson ’s Hillingdon constituency had a rate on Wednesday of 80.82, while Education Secretary Gavin Williamson in South Staffordshire hit 91.61, and Dominic Raab’s Elmbridge, Surrey seat rocketed to 127.20.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has a rate of 34.07 per 100,000 in West Suffolk, yet no new restrictions.

Rishi Sunak’s Richmond, North Yorks, stronghold has reached 74.45 and Robert Jenrick has seen his Newark and Sherwood patch hit 182.16 – after promising “greater freedom for local areas to design further measures in conjunction with us” on BBC Any Questions.

Yet Burnley – held by Red Wall Tory Antony Higginbotham – was locked down when the rate was almost a QUARTER of that, at 46.11.

Nottingham is now the worst Covid hotspot at 760.6 per 100,000 – yet no extra restrictions have been imposed.

Chris Oglesby of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said: “The Government can lock down the country if they want. What they can’t do is keep much of the North as a permanent open prison.”

And Dr Chaand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association added that wider “stronger measures brought in now” were needed.

His words were aimed at a PM branded a “hypocrite” by Labour’s Rupa Huq, who blasted him for having “one rule for them and another for the rest of the population”.

Nearly 30 of them have formed a Northern Research Group to ensure the PM keeps his promises.

Their leader, ex-Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry, told Radio 4’s Week in Westminster: “It’s a sort-of trade union for northern MPs.”

Sources close to London Mayor Sadiq Khan say he is poised to order a lockdown in the capital.

One told the Sunday Mirror: “The city is at a serious tipping point.”

The mayor is angry he is having to rely on GP statistics and intensive care admission figures to plot the course of the virus, as testing in the city is the lowest in the country.

Labour leader Keir Starmer hit out at the PM’s “serial incompetence” adding: “Test, trace and isolate is critical. The Prime Minister said we’d have a world-beating system – we just need an effective one.”

Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham demanded better new furlough terms and a rethink on pub curfews.

He warned he and other northern mayors would take legal action if talks this weekend on the north-south divide failed.

Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said: “There’s a serious disconnect between working people and the Prime Minister.

"If this was going on in the South East it wouldn’t be accepted.”

Meanwhile ex-shadow Chancellor John McDonnell demanded workers get at least minimum wage under Sunak’s job support scheme.

The Department of Health said: “The incidence rate is only one of a set of considerations regarding when it is appropriate to impose and release restrictions.”

No 10 did not comment.

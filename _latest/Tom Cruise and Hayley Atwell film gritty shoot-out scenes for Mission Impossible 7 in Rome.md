He has been busy filming scenes for the latest instalment in the iconic film franchise.

And Tom Cruise proved the drama had been ramped up even further as he joined Hayley Atwell to film gritty shoot-out scenes for Mission Impossible 7 in Rome on Monday.

The Oscar nominee, 58, and the Cinderella star, 38, held their hands up in a defensive gesture as they were ordered out of a police car and made to face up to their actions.

Tom looked sombre as he held onto Hayley's arm, with the beauty in turn holding up her hands during the gritty scenes.

The Rain Man star was every inch the action man in a silver waistcoat, matching trousers, a white shirt and tie as he chatted with director Christopher McQuarrie between takes.

Hayley opted for business chic in a crisp white blouse paired with black high-waisted trousers.

Her brunette locks were styled in soft waves while a radiant palette of make-up enhanced her pretty features.

Award-winning actor Tom has been spotted filming many exciting scenes in the last few months, including taking on motorbike jumps, parachuting and riding on top of moving trains while on set in Norway.

Filming for the upcoming action movie was halted in Italy earlier this year after cases of coronavirus rose sharply.

The crew and actors have been in Norway filming ever since, before returning to the Italian capital earlier this week to continue with scenes.

Earlier this summer it was reported that the media personality hired a Â£500,000 ship for the film's crew in Norway to avoid any coronavirus-related delays.

Filming was already delayed for five months after COVID-19 spread across Italy, where production had been based in March, leading the release date to be pushed back to November 2021.

'They are terrified of further delays. Tom is determined not to see any more hold-ups. The studio believes it will keep everyone safe and get this shoot wrapped up', a source told The Sun earlier this summer.

It was recently claimed that Tom was 'exempt from Norway's quarantine rules' as he restarted filming in the Scandinavian country.

The media personality revealed how 'excited' he was to start shooting the latest instalment of the franchise in a phone call with Norway's Minister of Culture Abid Raja.

Mission Impossible 7 will be released on November 19, 2021.

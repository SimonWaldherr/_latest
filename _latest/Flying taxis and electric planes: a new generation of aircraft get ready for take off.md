<div><p>Powered flight has been the stuff of dreams since Icarus, and the stuff of reality since the Wright Brothers took off in 1903 and travelled 120 feet. A mere 66 years later, man was on the Moon, 239,000 miles away. But advances in the half-century since have been modest by comparison.</p>
<p>We have not been back to the moon since 1972, our out-of-orbit ambitions residing in the International Space Station, a mere 250 miles up. Now, though, air travel might be entering another gravity-defying innovation explosion.</p>
<p>The seeds of change are being sown by destruction of business-as-usual. Covid has seen <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/air-travel-coronavirus-then-and-now/">global air passenger traffic collapse</a>, down 91pc in May compared to a year earlier; it is not expected to recover <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/04/24/gatwick-four-years-forpassenger-levels-recover/">until 2024</a>. Many airlines are not expected to survive to see that.</p>
<p>As the old model is shattered, however, a host of entrepreneurs are re-imagining air travel as we know it, while others rekindle dreams of flight which have long been relegated to science-fiction.</p>
<h4>Air taxis take off</h4>
<p>We have been waiting for flying cars since the Jetsons aired in 1962. Now a swarm of them have appeared, championing multiple methods of getting airborne, from fixed wing to drone-like quadcopter.</p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, two of the big names in the sector &#8211; Joby and Lilium &#8211; have just raised eye-catching sums (&#163;437m and &#163;178m respectively). Joby&#8217;s four-seater aircraft opts for six rotors; <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/12/tesla-sky-aims-transform-transport/">Lilium&#8217;s five-seater jet</a> uses 36 motors built into a hinged wing: both are fully electric, and both allow Vertical Take off and Landing (VTOL).</p>

<div><p>Michael Gove has compared Brexit to moving house in a "disastrous" call with business leaders.</p>
<p>On a 20-minute conference call with trade bodies and bosses from 250 leading companies, Cabinet Minister Mr Gove and Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned UK firms to prepare for a possible no-deal end to talks with the European Union.</p>
<p>Mr Gove described Brexit as being "like moving house, it&#8217;s a hassle at first but you are upgrading&#8221;.</p>
<p>One business leader said: "The idea is that [no-deal preparations] are in businesses&#8217; court now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another&#160;source described the call as "anodyne" and a third said it was&#160;&#8220;shocking, embarrassing and not constructive&#8221;, amid growing fears that the Government will seek to&#160;blame&#160;any disruption to trade on companies' failure to prepare.</p>
<p>Most of Britain's business chiefs and lobby groups either privately or publicly backed Remain, with some subsequently accused of refusing to accept the referendum result.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson spoke for 10 minutes before leaving in what one person described as a &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; move underlining his lack of interest in business.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is also reported to have described deadlocked talks as &#8220;rien ne vas plus&#8221;, which means "no more bets" in the casino game roulette.</p>
<p>One listener said: &#8220;It felt like it was to rally business and tell us about the &#8216;great opportunities to come&#8217; from Brexit the Government sees.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t use the phrase &#8216;sunny uplands of Brexit&#8217;, but that&#8217;s what they were saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>The call was &#8220;not bad tempered, there was no opportunity for it to be bad tempered&#8221;, said one person on it, adding the event &#8220;was carefully stage-managed. Just three obviously pre-selected questions were taken&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another source said: "It felt like an exercise so the Government can say it has formally talked to business. The Prime Minister does not have a grasp of detail and that&#8217;s what Brexit is about.</p>
<p>"It feels like only in the past few weeks they have realised this and it&#8217;s incredibly scary, especially as we don't have a lot of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>One listener argued they had learned nothing not easily accessible in the newspapers. They said: &#8220;It felt like an exercise so the Government can say it has formally talked to business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another person on the call said:&#160;&#160;&#8220;It was a big call with a massive audience. The Prime Minister stuck to what he said last week, no one learned anything.&#8221;</p>

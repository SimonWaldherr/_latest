The term “energy transition” has so far created about as much shareholder value as “profit warning” for the FTSE 100’s two energy giants, which are desperate to show they can clean up their act.

BP and Shell’s efforts to map out a path towards a net-zero carbon future have been greeted with scepticism in some quarters and fear in others, especially among those who have relied on them for years for generous dividends, now sharply reduced because of shrunken oil demand. Since Questor recommended selling BP in June, the shares have fallen by a third.

So it must be with some unease that long-suffering shareholders in Aggreko approach Nov 17, the date when the temporary power supply firm promises not only a strategic update but details of “how the business will evolve and deliver through the energy transition”.

Aggreko has certainly been forced to evolve but it has barely delivered under its chief executive of the past five years, Chris Weston.

Last year it said it would increase the dividend for the first time since 2014, which suggests some kind of corner-turning, although the final payment fell victim to coronavirus in the end. But a glance at the share price chart shows an eight-year downward spiral, exacerbated by the Covid-19 outbreak, which drove underlying operating profits down by 15pc at the half-year.

That’s one heck of a hangover since Aggreko’s chunky generators powered 39 venues used during London’s glorious 2012 Olympics. Questor has steered clear since 2017.

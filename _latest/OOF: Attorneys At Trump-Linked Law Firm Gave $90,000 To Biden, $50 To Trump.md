  OOF: Attorneys At Trump-Linked Law Firm Gave $90,000 To Biden, $50 To Trump 
description: > 
  Attorneys at law firms used by President Donald Trump or his reelection campaign are voting with their wallets.Reuters reported that attorneys at four firms that have worked for Trump or his campaign donated “overwhelmingly” to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.Attorneys at the Jones Day law firm, which has collected $4.5 million for its work for the Trump campaign, contributed just $50 to the president’s reelection efforts but gave $90,000 to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.The money represents contributions from individual attorneys at each firm, and not the firms themselves.The trend predates Trump: In 2012, President Barack Obama received $27.7 million from lawyers and law firms compared with $14.3 million given to Mitt Romney from those same groups, per Open Secrets.

  2020 election polls live: Latest Trump and Biden odds as president insists all forecasts are fake 
description: > 
  Former US president Barack Obama on WednesdayDonald Trump appears to be losing out on the white working class male support that was so integral to his election win in 2016 as the president himself lashes out at the latest dire projection from Fox News, insisting the survey is “totally FAKE” and that all forecasts ahead of the 3 November ballot are likely to be wrong.Barack Obama meanwhile gave a rousing speech in support of his former deputy Joe Biden in Philadelphia on Wednesday, tearing into Trump and urging young Americans to: “Vote like never before and leave no doubt".The latest Quinnipiac University survey finds Biden leading by eight percentage points in Pennsylvania, his home state and a crucial battleground.The Democrat also appears to be making significant gains in Texas, a Republican stronghold, with Quinnipiac placing the two candidates level on 47 percentage points each.

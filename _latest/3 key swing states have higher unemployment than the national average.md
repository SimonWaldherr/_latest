But in September, the decline was due partly to the unexpectedly high rate of people dropping out of the labor force. This was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/economy/women-workforce-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">especially true for women</a> in the prime working age between 35 and 44.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">People who are no longer in the labor force, no longer actively looking for work, are not accounted for in the nation's unemployment rate.</p><p></p><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-15 cn-zoneAdContainer"></ul><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The state-by-state numbers also hammer home that the recovery continues to be uneven. For example, states reliant on hospitality and tourism business, such as Hawaii and Nevada, which were hit harder by the crisis, are still lagging behind. The jobless rate in Hawaii stood at 15.1% in September, while Nevada's was at 12.6%, the two worst rates in the country.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Meanwhile, Nebraska has the country's lowest rate of joblessness at only 3.5%.</p></div>

There are so many rocks to climb,&#8221; Santella says. Many visitors come for August&#8217;s <a href="https://www.idahomountainfestival.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Idaho Mountain Festival</a>, a celebration of climbing with top athletes and gear manufacturers in attendance.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>More information:&#160;</strong>&#160;<a href="https://www.nps.gov/ciro/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">nps.gov/ciro</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Red River Gorge, Kentucky</h2><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Kentucky's Red River Gorge is well known in the climbing world for both beginner-friendly terrain and more challenging sections"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This designated geological area in Daniel Boone National Forest is prized for its climbing routes and rock scenery.

The area has been attracting climbers since the 1940s, and although known for its challenging terrain, it also has easier spots for newbies, Santella says.

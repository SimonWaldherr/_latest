<div><p>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</p><p>Broadway and TV actress Doreen Montalvo died after a sudden illness. She was 56.</p>
<p>Montalvo&#8217;s manager confirmed the news on Instagram, saying he was her &#8220;kindred spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been my honor and extreme pleasure to have worked with Doreen, as her manager. From the minute we met it was like we had been friends for years. Kindred spirits, for sure,&#8221; Steve Maihack captioned a tribute to Montalvo. &#8220;This last year had been such an exciting one for Doreen with the filming of both the IN THE HEIGHTS and WEST SIDE STORY feature films, as well as her return to Broadway in MRS DOUBTFIRE.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doreen could do anything. She was like a winning lotto ticket,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;She was all of ours winning lotto ticket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Montalvo appeared in the original Broadway cast of Lin-Manuel Miranda&#8217;s &#8220;In the Heights.&#8221; The playwright called it &#8220;unfair&#8221; that she passed away too soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is monstrously unfair that we did not get more time with her,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1317649805833744384" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Miranda tweeted</a>. &#8220;More shows with her. More music with her. More life with her. When someone brings that much joy and love to everyone they meet, that much commitment to the craft they love&#8230; it&#8217;s unfair. And heartbreaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also has a role in the upcoming Steven Spielberg adaptation of &#8220;West Side Story,&#8221; and has made appearances on &#8220;The Good Wife,&#8221; &#8220;Smash,&#8221; &#8220;Elementary&#8221; and Madam Secretary.</p>

<div><p>An April evening in the suburbs of Khartoum. After months of undercover work, I had learned to time my visits to khalwas, Sudan&#8217;s Islamic schools,<strong> </strong>to coincide with evening prayers. I entered while the sheikhs (teachers) and 50-odd boys dressed in their white djellabas were busy praying. As they knelt, I heard the clanking of chains on the boys&#8217; shackled legs. I sat down behind them and started filming, secretly.</p>
<p>I began investigating after allegations emerged of abuse inside some of these schools: children kept in chains, beaten and sexually abused. Khalwas have existed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan" class="u-underline">Sudan</a> for centuries. There are more than 30,000 of them across the country where children are taught to memorise the Qur&#8217;an. They are run by sheikhs who usually provide food, drink and shelter, free of charge. As a result, poor families often send their children to khalwas instead of public schools.</p>
<p>I had been working as a journalist in Sudan for five years, but this was the first time an assignment really felt personal. I was taught at a khalwa: a place where I would try to get through each day without being beaten.</p>

<p>In 2018, I began what would become a two-year investigation with BBC News Arabic and take me to 23 khalwas across Sudan. Before proper undercover equipment from the BBC arrived, I taped my phone inside a notebook, to secretly film.</p>
<p>Despite having gone to a khalwa myself, I was shocked by what I found. I saw children &#8211; some as young as five &#8211; beaten and shackled like animals. One boy with deep, raw wounds around his ankles told me: &#8220;We can be in groups of six or seven all chained together, and they [the sheikhs] make us run around in circles. Whenever one of us falls over we have to get up again because they keep whipping us &#8230; They say that this is good for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the worst experiences I had was in 2018 at Ahmed Hanafy, a well-respected khalwa in Darfur. In a study room, under a hot corrugated iron roof, a small boy was held down and whipped more than 30 times by a teacher. The only sound in the room was the lashing of the whip and the boy&#8217;s anguished cries. I wanted to grab the whip and hit the sheikh, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t. When I later contacted the school, the sheikh confirmed they do beat children but denied this incident ever took place.</p>
<p>Another disturbing case was that of two 14-year-old boys, Mohamed Nader and Ismail. When I visited them in hospital they were lying on their stomachs, unconscious, their backs stripped of flesh. They were beaten and tortured so badly they nearly died.</p>
<p>&#8220;They kept them in a room for five days without food or water,&#8221; Mohamed Nader&#8217;s father, Nader, told me.</p>

<p>&#8220;They rubbed tar all over their bodies. [Mohamed Nader] has been so badly beaten you can even see his spine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had filmed inside the same khalwa where this had happened, al-Khulafaa al-Rashideen, run by a man called Sheikh Hussein. The conditions there were the worst I had seen. Most of the boys were shackled and teachers hovered over them with whips in case they made any mistakes. One student pointed out a room with barred windows, which he described as a prison. It was the room in which Ismail and Mohamed Nader had been kept.</p>
<p>I kept in regular contact with the boys. Several months after the attack, as we played on a PlayStation together, Mohamed Nader began to tell me what happened when he was caught trying to escape with Ismail.</p>
<p>&#8220;They tied me up and laid me on my stomach before whipping me&#8221;, he said. The beatings went on for days. &#8220;A lot of people came to beat us while the rest of the khalwa was asleep. After that, I don&#8217;t know what happened, I woke up in the hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>The police charged two teachers with assault, who were later released on bail. The khalwa remained open.</p>
<p>As he stared at the screen, Mohamed Nader said: &#8220;There is rape in the khalwa. They would call you for it, in a macho way.&#8221; He said the smaller or weaker boys were abused by older students.</p>
<p>Mohamed Nader and Ismail were not sexually assaulted, but several other people also told me that rape happened in the khalwa under the management of Sheikh Hussein.</p>
<p>When I returned to the khalwa to talk to him, Sheikh Hussein admitted that it was wrong to imprison children, but maintained that shackling was &#8220;packed with benefits&#8221; and that &#8220;most khalwas use chaining, not just me&#8221;. He told me he had stopped using chains and that &#8220;the prison&#8221; was now a storeroom. When I asked about allegations of sexual abuse he became angry, categorically denying these claims and accusing me of attacking the Qu&#8217;ran.</p>
<p>The sheikh died in a car accident earlier this year.</p>
<p>The new transitional government is now conducting a survey of all khalwas in Sudan. The minister of religious affairs, Nasreddine Mufreh, said they would be reformed. There should be &#8220;no beating, torture, violation of human rights or children&#8217;s rights whatsoever&#8221; inside khalwas.</p>
<p>When I told him about the abuse I had seen, he replied: &#8220;The old regime didn&#8217;t have laws regulating khalwas. I can&#8217;t solve a problem caused by 30 years of the old regime overnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the influence that sheikhs hold, it&#8217;s rare for families to seek justice. However, Mohamed Nader&#8217;s parents have decided to press charges. Although the public prosecutor&#8217;s office is obliged to look into all cases of violence against children, Mohamed Nader&#8217;s parents have had to hire a lawyer to fight their case.</p>
<p>On the way into court his mother, Fatima, said the 2018 revolution had made her more optimistic: &#8220;In the past, we had no rights but now it&#8217;s different. With the new government, we will get our rights, God willing.&#8221;</p>
<p>After several hours inside she emerged disappointed. One of the defendants had failed to turn up and the hearing was postponed. The teachers accused of beating the boys still haven&#8217;t entered a plea. The khalwa is now run by Sheikh Hussein&#8217;s brother who told me that under his management the beating of children would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Mohamed Nader and Ismail are on a slow road to physical recovery. But thousands of other children across Sudan are still at risk.</p>

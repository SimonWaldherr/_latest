<p>Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation is all but assured. The Senate Republicans plan to ram through her nomination on the eve of the election. But this choice, in stark contrast to the supposed "<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-ruth-bader-ginsburg-elections-us-supreme-court-courts-1c42ab69fe886d1b2133129006918e7f">precedent" they set just four years ago</a>, will be the final straw that breaks the illusion that there is any civility left in Washington.</p><h2><strong>To confirm or not to confirm</strong></h2><p>At this point, it's nearly impossible to imagine the vote on Barrett getting delayed until after the election. Senate Democrats need four Republicans to delay, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/9/19/21447031/susan-collins-ginsburg-no-supreme-court-vacancy-vote-inauguration-day">only two have stepped forward</a>. A possible silver lining is that confirming Barrett right before the election will take some of the gas from Republican voters and further energize Democrats.&#160;</p><p>The Republican-held Senate seems to have made the decision that they would rather have a sixth seat on the Supreme Court than keep the issue alive to help them with the election. Perhaps they think they'll lose anyway &#8211; so this will be a last victory as their <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-supreme-court-senate-president-represent-minority-views-2019-12">minority rule</a> comes to an end.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Democrats, look in the mirror</strong></h2><p>Assuming Barrett is confirmed before year-end, Democrats will almost certainly end the legislative filibuster if they win the majority. As Washington and our country have become more divided, the US Senate has broken the norms that by and large made it the house of compromise and civility.</p>

<p>By some measure, Democrats have themselves to blame. When former President Bill Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court in 1993, she was the first Justice nominated by a Democrat in more than a quarter century. Indeed, Republican presidents <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations/SupremeCourtNominations1789present.htm">nominated 10 Justices</a> &#8211; more than the total number on the court &#8211; between Thurgood Marshall and Justice Ginsburg.</p><p>In addition, the <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/83761/1/sswp1351%20-%20published.pdf">Republicans have nominated younger Justices</a> to the court who can serve out their lifetime appointments longer, which has been the strategy for Trump's three nominees. The Republicans have been playing the long game for a long time.</p><p>Gamesmanship on the lower court began to spike when Clinton was president, and the Republican Senate started stalling his judicial nominees. Even conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist got in the act and rebuked the Senate for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/01/us/senate-imperils-judicial-system-rehnquist-says.html">delay tactics</a>.</p><p>This went back and forth with both sides playing politics until Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had enough and <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/harry-reid-nuclear-option-100199">changed the rules </a>in 2013 to make it easier to confirm judicial nominees. Reid excepted Supreme Court picks from the easier path, but Republicans <a href="https://time.com/4728558/neil-gorsuch-filibuster-senate-confirmation-vote/">changed that</a> too after Trump was elected. Now Trump is on the verge of more Supreme Court appointments than any president since Ronald Reagan.</p>

<h2><strong>The end of an era</strong></h2><p>With Republican's shameful hypocrisy on full display, Democrats have the opening to take their power to the next level in January. There's no political downside to ending the legislative filibuster, which will allow them to pass laws with a simple majority instead of a three-fifths vote.&#160;</p><p>It's mostly an inside baseball issue: hard to explain and not a kitchen table issue for average Americans. Plus they'll be able to pass a lot of legislation quickly, assuming they hold the House and win the White House. With this final rule change, the Senate will lose the last piece of what traditionally made it the chamber of careful consideration. But the polarization of our nation &#8212; <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/28/21077888/why-were-polarized-media-book-ezra-news">amplified by cable news</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/americans-reach-peak-partisan-polarization-under-trump.html">inspired by our leaders</a> &#8212; has brought us to this point.</p><p>Assuming they take this step, Democrats won't get tagged for making the rule change. They'll get tagged for what they do with it and whether they overplay their hand.&#160;&#160;</p><p>There's so much they urgently need to do on racial justice issues, gun safety, health care, prescription drugs, climate, infrastructure and executive branch ethics reform. And they'll want to pass a more aggressive economic support package for citizens, businesses, states and municipalities while the economy flounders in response to the pandemic.&#160;</p>

<p>If Senate Democrats do eliminate the filibuster, Democratic nominee Joe Biden's first 100 days could be among the most consequential and productive of recent history.</p><p>All of this needs to be done. Ultimately, many <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-focus-healthcare-economy-issues-not-trump-scandals-2020-2">Democratic positions are popular</a> among the people. But, if Americans see it as too much too fast, the Democrats will pay a price again.</p><h2><strong>To pack or not to pack</strong></h2><p>While the legislative goals may be generally popular, Democrats biggest question will be whether to pack the Supreme Court &#8212; that is adding more justice beyond the current nine &#8212; or change lower courts. The issue of packing the Supreme Court is much easier for the average voter to understand &#8211; so it has more landmines for Democrats. The Democrats could be painted as retributive for doing it and quickly end up on defense while trying to accomplish their important legislative goals.</p><p>Biden is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/13/politics/joe-biden-court-packing-not-a-fan/index.html">not enthusiastic about court-packing</a> because he fears a slippery slope &#8211; but he should continue to play his cards close to keep it as a threat to Republicans for pushing through Barrett. He'll also keep the part of the base that wants to pack the court energized.&#160;</p>

<p>If Barrett is confirmed, five of the nine Justices will have been appointed by <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-justices-president-popular-vote-1156542">presidents who lost the national popular vote</a> upon taking office. The country needs, at minimum, a balanced Supreme Court. But it deserves &#8211; and should demand &#8211; a Supreme Court that is reflective of the country. Instead we have Justices pushed through by officeholders without the popular mandate in the hopes that they'll block national reforms and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/poll-majority-adults-don-t-support-overturning-roe-v-wade-n1241269">precedents</a> our electorate supports.</p><p>Democrats may end up on the losing side again if they end the legislative filibuster or add seats to the Supreme Court. But the proud hypocrisy of the Senate GOP in filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year has made it time for the Democrats to go for it.</p>

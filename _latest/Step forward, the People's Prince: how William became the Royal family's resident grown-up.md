Revealing that the eldest were as “cheeky as each other” and that his wife Kate was better at “flossing” than him, despite all the turmoil of the last two years, A Planet For Us All depicted a prince at peace with himself. William’s calm and thoughtful demeanour could not have been more at odds with historical reports of the “hot-headed” Prince’s “petulance”.

Yet as royal author Ingrid Steward put it: “Becoming a parent has mellowed him. William has always had this ability to connect with people. I remember from some of his earliest engagements how much he reminded me of Diana.

“He’s very natural and not at all fake. He’s always had it but I think perhaps he was overshadowed by Harry. Now he’s no longer on the scene, we are reminded that William has the same qualities in spades.”

It is certainly a new take on the latest royal chapter, which has seen William pitted against his beloved brother ever since Harry married Meghan Markle in 2018.

This week, the Royal family has been plagued with yet more revelations about the tensions between the Cambridges and the Sussexes with the serialisation of Robert Lacey’s new book Battle of Brothers.

In it, the respected royal author claims that Harry felt overshadowed not only by his sibling’s superior status in the royal pecking order, but by his tendency to always put the Firm first. Lacey’s book also references William’s fiery temper, revealing that even Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, was taken aback by the extent of his “ranting and raving” at Prince Charles when she married into the Royal family in 2005.

Describing William as “letting rip with no apparent inhibition in his presence”, he said: “The rows had been earth-shattering by her account, with William doing the shouting and Charles submitting meekly.”

Stubborn and strong-willed William was begged by palace PRs to acknowledge his father’s role in his upbringing in media appearances to mark the 20th anniversary of the Princess’s death in 2017 but he refused.

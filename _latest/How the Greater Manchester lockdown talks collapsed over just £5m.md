<div><p>Number 10 attempted to put pressure on Mr Burnham on Monday night with a statement from Mr Jenrick giving Mr Burnham and his local leaders until midnight Tuesday to agree a deal.</p>
<p>The Housing Secretary said: "If we cannot reach agreement by midday tomorrow, then I must advise the Prime Minister that despite our best endeavours we&#8217;ve been unable to reach agreement. It&#8217;s not too late for local leaders to work with us to take action for the sake of the people of Greater Manchester.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a further conference call on Tuesday morning.</p>
<h3>'Why does this Government hate Greater Manchester?'</h3>
<p>But midday came and went and no deal. In the House of Commons, Labour MPs vented their frustration. Chancellor Rishi Sunak &#8211; a Conservative MP who represents the Richmond constituency in north Yorkshire &#8211; was asked by irate local Labour MP Andrew Gwynne: "Why does this Government hate Greater Manchester?"</p>
<p>Mr Burnham felt he was making all the running in the talks. He said he had cut an initial request from &#163;90 million in business support by the end of March, to &#163;75 million and then to &#163;65 million "as a bare minimum to prevent a winter of real hardship".</p>
<p>But senior Number 10 sources insisted they thought they had agreed a deal worth &#163;55 million, but then offered &#163;60 million when Mr Burnham asked for &#163;65 million.</p>
<p>Mr Burnham and Mr Johnson spoke on the phone around lunchtime. One senior Number 10 source said: "Andy Burnham has behaved very badly. The call with the Prime Minister was set up to greenlight the &#163;55 million."</p>
<h3>The talks collapse</h3>
<p>The talks were formally over just after 2pm. Mr Jenrick said in a statement: &#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed that despite recognising the gravity of the situation, the mayor has been unwilling to take the action that is required to get the spread of the virus under control in Greater Manchester and reach an agreement with the Government.</p>
<p>"I have therefore advised the Prime Minister that these discussions have concluded without an agreement.&#8221;</p>

Yet betting markets are now reversing course and point to a narrowing lead for the former vice president. The shrinking gap suggests the odds of a contested election are increasing, as President Donald Trump has already indicated he may avoid conceding the race if margins are relatively close in key states.</p><p>A higher chance of a contested result would cut into hopes for new stimulus and "likely put some downward pressure on risk markets for the near term," the team led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients. JPMorgan's tactical stock positioning gauges back up those concerns and signal some near-term vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-strategy-tips-beaten-down-stock-picks-todd-ahlsten-parnassus-2020-10?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank">A fund manager who's doubling up the competition in 2020 tells us his strategy for investing in the 'K-shaped' economic recovery - and details the only 2 stocks he added as the market recovery took off</a> &#13;

<p>To be sure, many have already pushed back projections for fresh fiscal support. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin remain locked in negotiations, aiming to reach a stimulus compromise before the end of the week and pass a bill before Election Day. Yet Senate Republicans back their own much smaller proposal, setting up each party to block the other's measures.</p><p>The stalemate led many strategists to look ahead to Election Day and its potential outcomes. Wall Street largely agrees that a Democratic sweep of the White House and Senate would create the path of least resistance for a large stimulus deal. A divided government would likely prolong the legislative deadlock and yield a smaller bill.</p><p>Biden's contracting lead suggests the election, contested or not, is more likely to result in a split Congress, JPMorgan said. Such an outcome would hamper the value trade, the bank's strategists added, as more cyclical sectors wouldn't enjoy the stimulus boost some expected.</p><p>While stocks might face some vulnerability in the short run, the team recommends a roughly 40% equity allocation for longer-term strategies. Upside in the stock market depends more on debt and liquidity creation than on fiscal stimulus, the strategists said. In turn, investors should pay more attention to the Federal Reserve's asset purchase plans for market insight, according to the bank.</p><p>Another relief bill could aid stocks, but only to the extent that it widens investor concentration to include cyclical sectors and value names, the team added. &#13;

  Google calls DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit ‘deeply flawed’ in GIF-laden blog response – TechCrunch 
description: > 
  Google was clearly anticipating today’s U.S. Department of Justice antitrust complaint filing – the company posted an extensive rebuttal of the lawsuit to its Keyword company blog.Google’s blog post is even sprinkled with GIFs – something that’s pretty common for the search giant when it comes to its consumer product launches.These GIFs include step-by-step screen recordings of setting search engines other than Google as your default in Chrome on both mobile and desktop.Google also reportedly makes reference to companies choosing their search engine as default because of the quality of their service, including both Apple and Mozilla (with a link drop for our own Frederic Lardinois).The DOJ’s full suit dropped this morning, and an initial analysis suggests that this scrutiny is perhaps inopportunely timed in terms of its proximity to the election to actually have any significant teeth.

<div><p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank">Google </a> was clearly anticipating today&#8217;s U.S. Department of Justice antitrust complaint filing &#8211; the company posted an extensive<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj"> rebuttal of the lawsuit to its Keyword company blog</a>. The post, penned by SVP of Global Affairs and Google Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker, suggests that the DOJ&#8217;s case is &#8220;deeply flawed&#8221; and &#8220;would do nothing to help consumers,&#8221; before going into a platform-by-platform description of why it thinks its position in the market isn&#8217;t representative of unfair market dominance that would amount to antitrust.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog post is even sprinkled with GIFs &#8211; something that&#8217;s pretty common for the search giant when it comes to its consumer product launches. These GIFs include step-by-step screen recordings of setting search engines other than Google as your default in Chrome on both mobile and desktop. These processes are both described as &#8220;trivially easy&#8221; by Walker in the post, but they do look like a bit of an own-goal when you notice just how many steps it takes to get the job done on desktop in particular, including what looks like a momentary hesitation in where to click to drill down further for the &#8220;Make Default&#8221; command.</p>

<p>Google also reportedly makes reference to companies choosing their search engine as default because of the quality of their service, including both <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank">Apple </a> and Mozilla (with a link drop for our own Frederic Lardinois). Ultimately, Google is making the argument that its search engine isn&#8217;t dominant because of a lack of viable options fostered by anti-competitive practices, but that instead it&#8217;s a result of building a quality product that consumers then opt in to using from among a field of choices.</p>
<p>The DOJ&#8217;s full suit dropped this morning, and an initial analysis suggests that this scrutiny is perhaps inopportunely timed in terms of its proximity to the election to actually have any significant teeth. There is some indication that a more broad, bipartisan investigation with support from state level attorney generals on both sides of the aisle could follow later, however, so it&#8217;s not necessarily all just going to go away regardless of election outcome.</p>

Sleeveless, typically worn over starchy shirts and often made in a pattern that resembles a 1980s bus seat, sweater vests were at one time considered to be more fuddy-duddy than fashionable.</p><p>The garment was first popularised in the 1930s when it was worn for sport, before fading in and out of fashion throughout the 1960s and 70s, during which time it gained intermittent popularity among virtuous bands such as the Osmonds and on TV shows like British sitcom <i>The Good Life</i>.</p><p></p><p>After this, the sweater vest&#8217;s credentials became confused as it was adopted by those at either end of the style spectrum: the nerds and the fashion trailblazers, all the way from <i>The Fresh Prince</i>&#8217;s Carlton Banks to Mick Jagger, Cher Horowitz in <i>Clueless </i>and of course, ultimate sweater vest aficionado, Chandler Bing in <i>Friends</i>.</p><p></p><p>But, there-in lies its appeal &#8211; the sweater vest is all about contradictions. It shouldn&#8217;t make sense to chop the sleeves off a perfectly good jumper, but doing so helps keep the body warm while leaving the arms free. And, just as much as it has been used by the &#8220;ensembly challenged&#8221; it has also enjoyed its moments in the style spotlight.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, fashion maverick <a href="/topic/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> has several in his collection, regularly pairing them with 70s-inspired flared slacks and stripy collared shirts for a look that feels simultaneously retro and modern, as does supermodel <a href="/topic/bella-hadid">Bella Hadid</a> and <i><a href="/topic/normal-people">Normal People</a></i>&#8217;s <a href="/topic/daisy-edgar-jones">Daisy Edgar-Jones</a>.</p><p class="sc-pRFZy iIPyzR copyright">(Rex Features)</p><p>The sweater vest has also become the item of choice among street style stars and was spotted on the runways of Dior, Prada, Louis Vuitton and Lacoste during the autumn/winter 2020 season.</p><p id="taboola-carousel-thumbnails"></p><p>Elsewhere, cult brands such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ganni.com/en-gb/home">Ganni</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://thefrankieshop.com">The Frankie Shop</a> have tapped into the trend with sell-out cable-knit styles and, according to global fashion search platform Lyst, searches for sweater vests have increased by 133 per cent since the beginning of August, with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acnestudios.com%2Fuk%2Fen%2Fribbed-knit-vest-ecru-beige%2FA60191-AE9104.html&amp;sref=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/sweater-vest-trend-knitwear-autumn-2020-harry-styles-best-high-street-designer-b1075686.html">Acne&#8217;s beige ribbed version</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100l84Ki/pubref:iA5OARHTkm/destination:https://www.farfetch.com/uk/shopping/women/maison-margiela-wool-mix-sweater-vest-item-15613330.aspx">Maison Margiela&#8217;s brown mixed wool vest</a> among the most sought after designs.</p><p>Need further proof of its popularity?

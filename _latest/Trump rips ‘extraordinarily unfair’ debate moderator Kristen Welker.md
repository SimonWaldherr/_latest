President Trump has ripped final debate moderator Kristen Welker as “extraordinarily unfair” after highlighting an exposé in The Post about her family’s ties to the Democrats.

“She’s always been terrible & unfair, just like most of the Fake News reporters, but I’ll still play the game,” the commander in chief tweeted Saturday after son Don Jr. shared The Post’s story.

“The people know! How’s Steve Scully doing?” he asked, a sarcastic reference to the C-SPAN political editor who was suspended after lying about being hacked after being called a “never Trumper.”

Trump also went after Welker during his Saturday night rally in Janesville, Wisconsin, after sarcastically referring to “totally unbiased anchors.”

“We have another one of them coming up next week,” he said, then naming the NBC News White House correspondent.

“I’ve known her for a long time, she’s extraordinarily unfair but that’s all right,” the president told the crowd.

He also referred to the fact that Welker’s Twitter account was taken down Friday, reappearing Saturday, suggesting it was to avoid a repeat of the Scully scandal.

“She deleted her entire account. I wonder why? I can’t imagine,” he said.

NBC told the Daily Mail that the temporary freeze on her account was just to ensure it was secure. “She consulted internally, made sure there was two-factor authentication and turned it back on,” a spokesperson said.

The Post revealed Saturday how Welker was previously a registered Democrat and her family has donated thousands to the party. In 2012, Welker and her family celebrated Christmas at the White House with the Obamas.

An NBC spokesperson told Politico that Welker has not had any party affiliation since registering to vote in Washington, D.C., in 2012.

The rep pointed to comments made earlier this month by Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller calling the White House correspondent “very fair” and “a very good choice” as debate moderator, Politico said.

  New York (CNN Business) The US housing market has remained red-hot this year during the pandemic as some flee expensive coastal cities for the suburbs.And experts say there could be election consequences.These urban-dwellers likely aren't trying to make a political statement: They're simply looking for more space and cheaper prices.But if more Democrat-leaning voters are suddenly moving to Republican enclaves, that could change the political landscape.Houses in red counties had an average price of $209,000.

  Coronavirus deaths rise for FIFTH week in a row in England and Wales 
description: > 
  AdvertisementThe number of people dying of Covid-19 in England and Wales has risen for the fifth week in a row to 438 between October 3 and 9.Coronavirus now accounts for 4.4 per cent of all deaths in the two nations – one in every 23.In the worst week on record, between April 11 and 17, the deaths of a staggering 8,758 coronavirus patients were recorded.In North-East England, where deaths were also the highest since June and where tougher lockdown rules are also in place, 60 Covid-19 deaths were registered in the week to October 9 — up from 40 the week before.'Usually around 300 people die each day in their homes in England and Wales,' said Cambridge University statistician Professor David Spiegelhalter.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The North West had 153 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending October 9, which was the highest number for the region since the week ending June 12. For comparison, the figure was just 106 for the previous seven-day spell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In North-East England, where deaths were also the highest since June and where tougher lockdown rules are also in place, 60 Covid-19 deaths were registered in the week to October 9 &#8212; up from 40 the week before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Registered deaths involving Covid-19 increased week-on-week in all but two regions of England in the week to October 9 &#8211; the exceptions were the East and South East.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Wales the weekly total increased from 25 to 37.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three people under the age of 40 died with Covid-19 in the most recent week, as the elderly continued to make up the vast majority of victims. Over-70s accounted for 358 out of the total 438 (82 per cent).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Deaths from all causes were more than 10 per cent above average for this time of year in Yorkshire and the Humber, the biggest spike recorded in England, with 1,067 registered compared to an expected level of 967.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the North West - which has been hit hard by the virus - they were 2.9 per cent above average at 1,367 compared to the expected 1,328. And in the North East they were 6.7 per cent above average at 544, when figures from the last five years suggested 510 were expected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in London the number of deaths from all causes remained 1.3 per cent below the average, at 902 when 912 were forecast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the South West - which has so far dodged the second wave of the virus - they were 4.2 per cent below average, at 1,010, compared to average 1,054. And in the East of England they were 5.7 per cent below average, the biggest plummet registered in the UK nation, at 1,019, compared to an average of 1,081.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Covid-19 fatalities make a resurgence the number of people dying of any cause has risen above average again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After spiking to levels higher than 11,000 more deaths than usual for the time of year in April, the total numbers of people dying each week then fell below average over the summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fewer people than usual have been dying of non-Covid illnesses in hospitals and care homes, and this continues to be the case even as coronavirus deaths rise.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts say this may be because hospitals did not admit as many people as they normally would because they were saving space for Covid-19 patients during the spring.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, more people than average are dying in private homes. A separate report from the ONS yesterday found that there have been more than 26,000 at-home deaths above normal levels this year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Between March 20, the week lockdown started, and September 11, a total of 85,400 people died in private homes rather than in hospitals or care homes, the report showed yesterday. This is the equivalent of around 100 extra deaths each day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number, which is a surge of 43.8 per cent on the average for that time of year, includes fatalities of any cause, with Covid-19 only mentioned on 2.9 per cent of all the death certificates.&#160;Six out of 10 of those who died at home were aged over 70.&#160;</p><img id="i-6af6efd012a88648" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="814" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-6af6efd012a88648" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/10/34607482-8858687-image-a-13_1603184460216.jpg" height="814" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-33646f8fee319d3d" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="700" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-33646f8fee319d3d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/12/34612462-8858687-image-a-3_1603192277858.jpg" height="700" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-c4b3e966ab3e707c" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="728" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-c4b3e966ab3e707c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/10/34607480-8858687-image-a-16_1603184471279.jpg" height="728" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-a483ee090dee232d" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="864" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-a483ee090dee232d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/10/34607476-8858687-image-a-22_1603184484215.jpg" height="864" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-4bc6eb095b2960be" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="964" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-4bc6eb095b2960be" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/10/34607474-8858687-image-a-25_1603184490461.jpg" height="964" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-4bc6e3646f3d2b54" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="924" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-4bc6e3646f3d2b54" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/10/34607472-8858687-image-a-28_1603184496576.jpg" height="924" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption"></p><h3 class="mol-factbox-title">ANDY BURNHAM ADMITS HE WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT NO10'S CURBS</h3> <img id="i-c6e5f3626fa0e3f4" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="286" width="422" alt="The daily number of coronavirus cases, counted by the date specimens were taken, has eased in key cities over recent days" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-c6e5f3626fa0e3f4" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/11/34586694-8858687-The_daily_number_of_coronavirus_cases_counted_by_the_date_specim-a-1_1603189488946.jpg" height="286" width="422" alt="The daily number of coronavirus cases, counted by the date specimens were taken, has eased in key cities over recent days" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">The daily number of coronavirus cases, counted by the date specimens were taken, has eased in key cities over recent days&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Andy Burnham today conceded he will have to fall into line if the government imposes Tier Three lockdown on Greater Manchester - as the minutes tick down to a 'high noon' deadline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Regional mayor Andy Burnham railed at the 'provocative' ultimatum from the government this morning after a week of bitter wrangling over a compensation package.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he admitted he will have to obey the law if Boris Johnson forces the issue, saying he would put one final number to the 'penny pinching' government - which is already thought to be offering the area up to &#163;100million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a grim warning, he said: 'I would predict everybody will end up in Tier 3 at some point during the winter - what we need is a fair financial framework for Tier 3.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Burnham also swiped at 'selective' figures highlighted by Downing Street that suggested Greater Manchester hospitals could be overwhelmed within weeks unless tougher action is taken.

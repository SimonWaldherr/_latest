London (CNN Business) The owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, the Scottish heritage brand that makes Harris Tweed coats and cashmere sweaters, has warned of major job cuts as it struggles to save the business from collapse.

EWM Group, owned by retail entrepreneur Philip Day, said in a statement that it plans to appoint administrators to restructure the company, which also owns the Peacocks and Jaeger clothing brands. It is considering selling parts of the group, which employs 24,000 people.

"We have applied to court today for a short breathing space to assess our options before moving to appoint administrators," said CEO Steve Simpson. "There will inevitably be significant cuts and closures as we work our way through this," he added.

British companies facing insolvency can appoint administrators to provide protection against creditors. But it means handing over control to the administrators, and the process can lead to the business being closed down.

Marks & Spencer MAKSY Walgreens WBA EWM is the latest UK retailer to embark on a major restructuring, as the pandemic crushes clothing sales and accelerates a shift to e-commerce that was already hurting physical stores., TM Lewin, Harrods, Topshop owner Arcadia and-owned pharmacy chain Boots have announced up to 12,800 layoffs between them. Even Selfridges has been forced to retrench, announcing 450 job cuts in July.

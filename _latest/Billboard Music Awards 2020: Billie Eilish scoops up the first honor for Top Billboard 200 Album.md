'I just want to say right now, if you're at home watching this, you are thinking about changing yourself to feel worthy, this is your sign to remain true to who you are. Let me tell you all something - when people try to suppress something, it's normally because that thing holds power.

'They're afraid of your power. There's power in who you are, there's power in your voice. So whether it's through music, protests, or your right to vote, use your power use your voice and refuse to be suppressed. Thank you so much to Billboard I love you all god bless you all. Bye!'

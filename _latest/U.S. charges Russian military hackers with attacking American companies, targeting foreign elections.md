  U.S. charges Russian military hackers with attacking American companies, targeting foreign elections 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON â€” The U.S. Justice Department on Monday accused six Russian computer hackers of causing power blackouts, financial losses of nearly $1 billion and targeting the 2018 Winter Olympics in China.Court documents said the six were officers in the Russian military's main intelligence directorate and used "some of the most destructive malware to date."Prosecutors said it caused blackouts in Ukraine, victimized the Olympics opening ceremony, and caused losses of nearly $1 billion to Pennsylvania's Heritage Valley Health System and three other U.S. companies, including a large pharmaceutical manufacturer.John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said the behavior detailed in Monday's charges against Russian military officers amount to an accusation of the most disruptive and destructive computer attacks ever attributed to a single group.That unit is responsible for many of the most destructive cyberattacks in history, said John Hultquist, the director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity company Mandiant.

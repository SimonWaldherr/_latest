President Trump remains on the sidelines after testing positive for the coronavirus last week with less than a month to go until Election Day. On Thursday the White House physician said the President can return to public events as soon as this weekend. Jared and FOX News Correspondent Mark Meredith discuss when we'll see the President back on the campaign trail.

For months, Congress has failed to reach an agreement on additional coronavirus relief. Now, the White House is preparing to offer a new $1.8 trillion relief deal just days after President Trump called off negotiations on a second round of aid to Americans. The question remains, will the bill finally pass or will there be another obstacle in the way? Jared and Fox News Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram discuss if we should expect relief soon.

The Commission on Presidential Debates announced the second debate will be a virtual one. President Trump followed-up saying he would not participate in a virtual debate.

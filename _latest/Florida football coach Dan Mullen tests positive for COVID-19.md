Corrections and clarifications: In an earlier version of this story, the result of the Florida-Texas A&M game was misstated. Florida lost that game.

Florida coach Dan Mullen has joined college football's growing list of coaches who have tested positive for COVID-19.

Mullen announced the news via Twitter.

"Thank you Gator Nation for all your support for the program this week. Thankfully, everyone impacted is recovering well and has experienced mild to no symptoms. I have also tested positive for COVID and have received word that my test has been confirmed. I'm continuing to self-isolate from my family, who all remain healthy, and am following all the guidelines set forth by UF Health, the CDC, and our public health officials. I am proud of how our players, staff and campus community have navigated this unprecedented time and hope all continue to be safe."

Mullen's tweet came hours after Alabama announced coach Nick Saban, who initially tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, had taken several tests — all of which returned negative — and would be on the sideline for the Crimson Tide's game against Georgia. His negative test result came from an outside lab.

ROLLING THE DICE? Is college football pressing its luck with scattershot mask enforcement?

BIG NUMBERS: A look inside No. 1 Clemson's rout of Georgia Tech

Earlier this week, the LSU-Florida game scheduled for Saturday was postponed after an outbreak was reported on the Gators' team.

On Friday, the Missouri-Florida game originally scheduled for Oct. 24 was pushed to Oct. 31.

After a loss to Texas A&M last week, Mullen said he wanted The Swamp filled with fans for the game against LSU. There also has been discussion that the Florida-Georgia game on Nov. 7, also known as the World's Largest Cocktail Party, could have more fans at TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lifted restrictions. Since then, officials from the city have said the crowd will be limited.

Other coaches who have tested positive this season include Kansas' Les Miles, Jackson State's Jeff Grass, Arizona State's Kevin Sumlin and Florida State's Mike Norvell.

Also this week, three SEC schools — Ole Miss, Tennessee and Texas A&M — were fined $100,000 for violating COVID-19 protocols.

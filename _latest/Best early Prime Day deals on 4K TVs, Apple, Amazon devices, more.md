Our picks for the best early Prime Day deals:

Well, folks, it's finally almost time for Amazon Prime Day 2020. The two-day shopping event officially kicks off at midnight PT Oct. 13 (that's 3 a.m. for East Coasters). Of course, you don't actually have to wait for the official start time to begin shopping deals — we've already found some pretty great discounts.

Amazon isn't the only retailer participating in its shopping holiday. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target are all hosting their own versions of Prime Day as well, so the internet is chock full of deals.

AMAZON DEVICES

Our top pick: Echo Show 5 — $44.99 (save $45)

This is not the newest model in the Echo Show lineup, but it is the most compact and the best for keeping on a nightstand or end table. You can control smart devices, make video calls, watch shows and movies, and tons more.

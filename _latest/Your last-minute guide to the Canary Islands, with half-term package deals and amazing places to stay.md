<div><h3>Tenerife</h3>
<h4>Why go?</h4>
<p>Like Majorca and Ibiza before it, Tenerife is finally succeeding in shedding its tacky chrysalis, and morphing into a sophisticated destination happy to hold its own in the company of high spenders, gastronomes and choosy golfers. That&#8217;s not to say the &#8216;old Tenerife&#8217; has met its maker, it just self-perpetuates in the background while Michelin muscles into the restaurant scene, chic beach clubs claim bucket-and-spade territory, and boutique boltholes provide windows to the previously bypassed and greener side of the island. Most holidaymakers head to the south-western resorts of Los Cristianos, Playa de las Americas and Costa Adeje where the bulk of the island&#8217;s holiday accommodation is located.</p>

<h3>Fuerteventura</h3>
<h4>Why go?</h4>
<p>Golden drifts of sand, like fine-spun silk, ripple towards the sparkling shores of Fuerteventura. Goats are herded across arid plains dotted with windmills and long-dead volcanoes, scarred and deformed, pierce the cloudless sky. Just 50 miles from Saharan Africa, the island has a breathtaking, barren beauty. Despite the volcanic terrain, it has some of the best beaches in the Canary Islands &#8211; miles and miles of largely deserted sand. Guaranteed sunshine and negligible rain make it a great year-round destination, and there is no time difference after the four-hour flight.&#160;</p>

<h3>Lanzarote</h3>
<h4>Why go?</h4>
<p>Lanzarote&#8217;s history is as turbulent as the sweep of volcanoes that forged it and today still spectacularly dominate one of Macaronesia&#8217;s most dramatic islands, whose entirety is a Unesco Biosphere Reserve. Legends swirl around of daring adventurers and scheming pirates, through to marauding Berbers and conquering Spaniards. Since the 1960s affordable jet travel has brought a wave of new arrivals to the beach resorts of Puerto del Carmen, Costa Teguise and Playa Blanca. All over the island, you see the influence of the visionary artist, architect and environmentalist C&#233;sar Manrique, who saved Lanzarote from the ravages of rampant development. His extraordinary creations accentuate the unique geology of the island and are now its main tourist attractions. His legacy is an island where style and design very much accompany substance, whether you are reclining in one of the bountiful vineyards with a glass of superb Malvasia, enjoying boat fresh seafood in an oceanfront restaurant or just lazing on one of Lanzarote&#8217;s shimmering necklace of sandy beaches.</p>

<h3>Gran Canaria</h3>
<h4>Why go?</h4>
<p>Forever in the enormous shadow of its neighbour to the west, Tenerife, Gran Canaria is nonetheless never so eclipsed that it cannot provide temperatures around the 20 degrees mark as autumn makes the rest of Europe shiver. In truth, the third-largest Canary Island is a fabulous destination. The capital Las Palmas offers elegant culture at its Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno &#8211; but saves its best for the beach in the shape of Playa de las Canteras.</p>

British Airways flies return from London Heathrow from &#163;159; Ryanair flies return from London Stansted&#160; from &#163;60; easyJet flies return from London Gatwick from &#163;113 and from Bristol from &#163;131.</p>

<h4>Package options</h4>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lastminute.com/" target="_blank">Lastminute.com</a> offers a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seven-night stay at the 4* Labranda Playa Bonita</a> on a half-board basis for &#163;539pp, departing October 25. Flights are included.&#160;</p>
<h3>La Palma</h3>
<h4>Why go?</h4>
<p>The Spanish know La Palma as La Isla Bonita: &#8220;The Pretty Island&#8221;. And she is indeed a beauty. Plentiful panoramas represent one good reason to visit: of volcanic cones and rocky barrancos (ravines), lush forests, terraced hillsides studded with rainbow hamlets, craggy coastlines and the limitless, cobalt Atlantic. You&#8217;ll find another two at the end of your legs. Because walking is the big draw on the north-westernmost Canary Island: laced with more than 600 miles of waymarked footpaths, it&#8217;s a treat for trekkers.&#160;</p>
<h4>Who's flying there?</h4>
<p>There are no direct flights departing Saturday October 24 and returning Saturday October 31. Iberia offers flights on the above dates with a short stopover in Madrid from &#163;307.</p>

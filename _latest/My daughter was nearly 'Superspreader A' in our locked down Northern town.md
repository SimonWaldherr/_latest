Back in July, not long after Leicester had the dubious honour of being the first UK city to enter local lockdown, I joked with my neighbours over the garden fence that should our town meet the same fate then we’d surely have my daughter, Jenny, to thank for it.

The Prime Minister, Jenny cheerfully declared on Instagram, had personally saved her 23rd birthday by reopening hospitality a couple of weeks earlier. She and her friends weren’t going to let the fairly arbitrary rules in place back then get in the way of making it a night to remember – they’d separately booked 15 tables for the evening in a local bar, meaning they’d be in the same venue but with households kept apart.

"We’re not breaking any rules," Jenny insisted when I expressed concern at an event that appeared to have more guests than the 30 that were allowed to attend a wedding at that time. "We’ll be really sensible."

And so, naively, I persuaded myself that an evening of toasts and cheery wishes passed on from table to table in a perfectly civilised, socially distanced manner would ensue. Although I can’t pretend it was a total shock when pictures uploaded to social media the next morning told a far less salubrious story.

Seeing all that high-resolution drunken hugging, kissing and general raucousness made it feel like coronavirus really had been defeated.

"Oh, good for them," my 70-something neighbours said when I shared this less than edifying tale a few days later, generously insisting the young’uns deserved a night letting their hair down. "What harm can it have done?"

Well, indeed.

At that very moment my phone started ringing, so I cracked a joke about Jenny putting us all in lockdown and went inside to take the call.

It was Jenny, crying. Her hairdresser, who she’d spent three hours with the day before her birthday, had tested positive for Covid. My daughter needed now to self-isolate, get tested and most horrifying of all, tell the 30-plus people she’d spent her birthday with what had happened.

"Thank God she doesn’t live at home," I told my husband that evening, thinking of reputation management as much as our health. Her residing elsewhere would allow us to shrug off at least some of the flak that might be to come, because we hadn’t been in a position to lay down any laws... Cowardly, I know.

Thankfully though, Jenny didn’t develop the illness – but her name was still mud for weeks, after various friends felt duty-bound to cancel visits to parents and grandparents along with any other plans they’d made, in case she’d unwittingly given it to them.

I was reminded of how close Jenny came to being "Superspreader A" again last week when Matt Hancock announced that, along with the three metropolitan areas being put into strict lockdown, Warrington – you guessed it, my local town – is an infection hotbed that needs dealing with via the same draconian measures.

Actually, I felt sick with horror at the thought of what might have been.

"Everyone would have blamed you," my hairdresser – the only person I’d so far trusted with the full story – pointed out.

He’s spot on: the sins of the daughter are always visited upon the mother. Which is fine, as long as the crime doesn’t involve a terrible plague that could kill grandma.

It’s why my girlfriends with younger children are so terrified one of their kids will turn out to be the "Patient Zero" who closes the local primary school and forces everyone back into home-schooling, that they're keeping them off for the merest sniffle.

The shame’s bad enough when you get the blame for an outbreak of nits. But at least those little blighters don’t have the power to shut your whole town down.

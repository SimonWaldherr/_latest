<p>When India Oxenberg dropped out of college at 19, she had dreams of starting her own catering company in Los Angeles.&#160;</p><p>But despite her passion for the culinary arts, she felt she was lacking a kind of business acumen.&#160;</p><p>"I felt like I was missing a lot of skills," Oxenberg, now 29, told Business Insider. "And I felt like I was missing the confidence that I needed to even just pursue something like that ... Something entrepreneurial is hard regardless, let alone being 19."&#160;</p><p>Oxenberg's ears perked up at a business opportunity raised by her mother, the former "Dynasty" star Catherine Oxenberg. It was a new training program called the Executive Success Program, run by a group called Nxivm. The pair soon attended an in-person introduction put on by the group.</p><p>"The way that they pitched it was that this was going to be a practical MBA and that it was going to be my version of alternative education," India Oxenberg said. "They said I was going to gain the skills that I needed in order to be successful in my life. And on top of it, they also sold that they would be able to remove illogical fears that were holding you back from going all in on any of your projects."&#160;</p><p>"It was exactly what I wanted and what I felt like I needed," she added. "So I was like, 'Sign me up.'"&#160;</p><p>Little did she know, it would launch her on a seven-year journey into one of the most notorious cults in American history, where she said she was psychologically and physically tortured and abused, and even branded with another human being's initials.</p><h2><strong>Nxivm as a brand&#160;</strong></h2><p>The Nxivm cult and its leader, Keith Raniere, were thrust into the spotlight in March 2018 after Raniere was arrested in a luxury villa outside Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and indicted on a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/self-help-guru-convicted-in-lurid-sex-trafficking-case-2019-6">series of federal charges</a> including sex trafficking, conspiracy for sex trafficking, and conspiracy to commit forced labor. On June 19, 2019, Raniere was convicted of all charges as well as racketeering.</p>

<p>The allegations stemmed from a secret "master-slave" sorority group within Nxivm called DOS &#8212; which stood for Dominus Obsequious Sororium &#8212; or "The Vow," where women were starved and branded with Raniere's initials, according to prosecutors. Dozens of women have since come forward with harrowing accounts of their involvement with DOS, including Sarah Edmondson, who was the first to come out publicly in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/nyregion/nxivm-women-branded-albany.html">The New York Times</a>.</p><p>Now Oxenberg is speaking out about her experience. She recounted her story in a <a href="https://www.starz.com/us/en/series/59967/episodes?season=1">four-part documentary series</a> titled "Seduced: Inside The Nxivm Cult," which premiered on Starz on October 18.</p><p>Oxenberg told Business Insider how Raniere's use of tactics similar to those of multilevel-marketing companies ultimately reeled her in and got her to stay.</p><h2>'They used people of notoriety in order to recruit'</h2><p>When Oxenberg attended the initial pitch for the Executive Success Program, she said she remembered noticing high-profile entrepreneurs, Harvard grads, and even Hollywood celebrities were also in attendance. The group leaned on the involvement of stars such as the "Smallville" actress Allison Mack, who joined in 2010, as a way to gain trust from members, Oxenberg said.&#160;</p><p>"They used people of notoriety in order to recruit, and they also used word of mouth," she said, adding that those tactics were not dissimilar to those of well-known multilevel-marketing companies. "They didn't actually have to advertise because once you were indoctrinated enough into the program &#8230; you would go out and tell people. And because they trusted you, they would say yes."</p><p>It's called multilevel marketing because revenue is derived both from commission on sales of products and from the sales of recruits, referred to as downline distributing. Looking back at the Executive Success Program now, Oxenberg simply says, "it was an MLM."</p><p>The Department of Justice's <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/press-release/file/1046381/download">complaint against Raniere</a> alleged that Nxivm "maintains features of a multilevel marketing scheme," in which "members are recruited via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme."</p><p><strong>

</strong></p><p>The personal dynamics have a power of their own in an organizational setting, said Jennifer Chatman, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, who researches, teaches, and consults on how companies leverage organizational culture to improve corporate performance.</p>

<p>"Two things can happen," she told Business Insider. "One is that the organization is kind of blessed by your friend. And the second is that you walk in already feeling pressure to perform because it's your friends, who you care about."&#160;</p><p>Nxivm members were also taught to go after people looking for connection or money, Oxenberg said.</p><p>"It could be a guy having a midlife crisis or a woman who just left a divorce or a person who's folding a business, you were taught to target those types of things in their recruitment style," Oxenberg said of Nxivm. "I was a pretty enthusiastic recruiter because at the time I believed that it was a good thing."&#160;</p><p>She added, "Recruitment was the only way to excel in the program."</p><p>In that same vein, Chatman said "MLMs often target new moms who are at home with children and feeling isolated and not part of the world anymore."&#160;</p><p>For both Nxivm and MLMs, in Chatman's view, it's not about the product itself but establishing trust and admiration between the followers and the company.</p><p>"The psychological techniques are the same," Chatman said. "It's about solidifying a person's identity as linked to this organization and increasing their commitment to the organization so that they're willing to kind of do anything."&#160;</p><h2><strong>For Nxivm, 'only the people at the top were able to make money'</strong></h2><p>Like MLMs, Nxivm was structured with levels. For Nxivm, this was signified by colored sashes rewarded for more recruits amassed and more courses paid for.</p>

<p>Oxenberg's first official training, a five-day intensive course, cost $3,000 per person. The class was the first of many that Oxenberg would pay for in order to rise in the ranks as a Nxivm coach from 2011 to 2017.</p><p>"I actually never made any money from Nxivm," Oxenberg said, adding that she gave "nearly $100,000" to Raniere &#8212; who told members to call him "Vanguard."</p><p>Oxenberg saw similarities with the MLM structure in the sense that people were recruited and then those people in turn recruited others, and because those at the top tended to make the most money, she said. Of Nxivm, she claimed "only the people at the top were able to make money." She said she was "always sort of perplexed by that," adding that people like top Nxivm member Nancy Salzman drove BMWs and lived in "fancy" houses in the suburbs.</p><p><strong>

</strong></p><p>Raniere had a knack for recruiting affluent followers to bankroll Nxivm, such as sisters Clare and Sara Bronfman, the daughters of the billionaire and former Seagram CEO Edgar Bronfman Sr. Clare Bronfman funneled roughly $150 million into Nxivm, according to court documents <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/11/bronfman-201011">obtained by Vanity Fair</a>, and has since been convicted of conspiracy to conceal and harbor immigrants for financial gain and identity fraud and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/thelife/news/seagrams-heiress-clare-bronfman-has-been-sentenced-to-almost-7-years-in-prison-for-her-involvement-in-the-nxivm-cult/articleshow/78417434.cms">sentenced to six years in prison</a>.</p><p>Despite Raniere's claims that Nxivm &#8212; which was based in Albany, New York &#8212; was meant to expand the personal and professional growth of its members, it ultimately primarily benefited him.</p><p>Nxivm "was essentially a bait-and-switch con," Rick Alan Ross, the founder of the <a href="https://culteducation.com/">Education Institute</a> nonprofit and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cults-Inside-Out-How-People-ebook/dp/B00OZR1QNO">"Cults Inside Out: How People Get In and Can Get Out,"</a> told Business Insider. "So basically, he told people you could share in the profits, and at the same time you're helping people to improve their understanding of the business world and be better businesspeople. So there was this lure that in my opinion was deliberately faked."&#160;</p><p>Chatman, of the Haas School, added that oftentimes with downline distributors, the people at the top are making much of their money from members buying in or buying products, rather than product sales to customers.</p><h2><strong>'He has the same playbook for every company'</strong></h2><p>Nxivm wasn't Raniere's first foray into the multilevel-marketing world. In the early 1980s, Ross previously reported, Raniere worked briefly at Amway and "copied ideas" to use in his own ventures. Amway told Business Insider it had no records of Raniere's employment at the company but that records on file date back only to the '90s.</p>

<p id="gpt-post-news-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-5" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p>In 1990, Raniere started his own multilevel-marketing company called Consumers' Buyline Inc., which touted high commissions for the sales of discount coupons on household items. He later claimed to have sold over $1 billion in product and employed 80 people, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2019/05/15/keith-raniere-the-leader-of-the-nxivm-sex-cult/#36d6b44a35a9">Forbes reported</a>.</p><p>By '93, Raniere was hit with a civil lawsuit by the New York attorney general, which included 20 states alleging that the company was a pyramid scheme. He settled the case for $40,000 and signed an order that prevented him from "promoting, offering, or granting participation in a chain distribution scheme," the Albany <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Law-enforcement-has-fielded-NXIVM-complaints-for-12348611.php">Times Union</a> reported.&#160;</p><p>"In my opinion, he violated that agreement by setting up multilevels of Nxivm," Ross said.&#160;</p><p>Raniere went on to create another multilevel-selling company, National Health Network, which folded in 1999, before launching the Executive Success Program with his business partner, Salzman. That was soon rebranded as Nxivm.&#160;</p><p>"He has the same playbook for every company," Oxenberg said. "So he's hiding behind products or hiding behind personal growth, which is also a totally unregulated industry. He was able to do what he does, which is prey upon people and exploit people in any industry that he was in. It's really dangerous."</p><p>But Nxivm promised something different from most MLMs.</p><p>"Raniere wasn't just selling the idea that you could make money by recruiting people to take courses, he was trying and successfully selling people on the idea that they could change the world," Ross said.&#160;</p><p>After he gained the trust of his followers, he was able to wield his power in cruel ways, according to the allegations set forth at his trial.</p>

<p>"Once you have the ability to exert what we call social control, rather than what we call formal control &#8212; rules, policies, and procedures, which is how most organizations work &#8212; the sky's the limit, right?" Chatman said.</p><h2><strong>'It wasn't until I left that I even considered that what they had on me'</strong></h2><p>After four years of being a part of Nxivm, Oxenberg was approached by Mack for a secret "women's empowerment" group called DOS that was "meant to make you stronger and more capable and to push against your fears and vulnerabilities," Oxenberg said. "She approached me when we were at a birthday party and started to ask me questions about my personal relationship. At the time, I was dating someone in the organization and it wasn't going well," she added.</p><p>"She started to press me more on: What did I want? What were my fears? And it really was a seduction," Oxenberg said. "I think that's really what makes the title of the series so appropriate, because everything that she did with me led me in the direction of trusting and confiding in her more and more to the point that I said yes to her proposition to DOS."</p><p>The first thing Oxenberg said she was forced to hand over was "collateral," which had to consist of physical evidence (as in photos and writing) of dark family and personal secrets to prove her dedication to the group.</p><p><strong>

</strong></p><p>"She wanted something that would be damaging towards family reputation, financial or photographs," Oxenberg said. "It wasn't until I left that I even considered that what they had on me [could be used as] blackmail &#8230; a lot of blackmail."</p><p>Soon after, she moved from California to Albany to deepen her involvement with DOS and live with Mack, who became her "master" and she the "slave," Oxenberg said.&#160;</p><p>"At a certain point, I had to ask permission to eat, to go anywhere, and to travel," she said. "It was a pretty intense level of control. It's so twisted that when I look at it now, it's just so obvious that it's abusive. But at the time I felt like I deserved it."</p><h2>'We didn't have the option to say no'</h2><p>Oxenberg alleged that in 2015 Mack gave her a "seduction assignment" where she had to seduce Raniere. "It was like telling me to go sleep with the principal," she said. Mack's attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.&#160;</p>

<p>"Even though I was scared and uncomfortable and I didn't want to do it, I did it," she said. But in her view, "there was no real consent ever," she added.&#160;</p><p>Soon after, she said she was instructed to participate in a "branding ceremony" where she and other "slaves" would sear Raniere's initials onto their pelvises.</p><p>"It was supposed to be, in her words, 'a bonding experience and a way to pledge your devotion or commitment to the group through a painful thing,'" Oxenberg said. "We didn't have the option to say no."&#160;</p><p>That night, Oxenberg said she was the first to be branded.</p><p>"It was scary and it was painful, but I was very much dissociated from and separate from my body," she said. "And we were also told that the brand was a symbol of the elements and we were never told that they were Keith's initials."</p><p>Though the FBI launched an investigation into Raniere and Nxivm's members, Oxenberg said the reality of it didn't really hit her until Mack <a href="https://www.insider.com/allison-mack-arrested-alleged-sex-cult-nxivm-2018-4">was arrested in April 2019</a>.</p><p>"That's when I started to maybe consider that I might be arrested," she said. "I was so indoctrinated at that point that I wasn't able to see things very clearly."</p><p>Oxenberg finally left Nxivm after Raniere's arrest and began to "deprogram" her mind through therapy and self-healing, she said. She was also reunited with her mother, who had fought for years to free her daughter from Nxivm.</p>

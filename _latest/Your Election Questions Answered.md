Some ballots will also include state and local races, as well as propositions covering a range of issues like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://sdsos.gov/elections-voting/assets/ConstitutionalAmendmentAPressRelease.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">marijuana legalization</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2019-2020/120FinalCorrected.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abortion access</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=64632&amp;seqnum=5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voting methods</a>.</p><p class="notification-copy">

    <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Contact local officials to see what&#8217;s on the ballot in your community, or check unofficial guides like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vote411.org/ballot" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vote411</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ballotpedia</a>, where you can search for information based on where you live.</p><h3 class="css-e307km e1gnsphs0" id="link-4a3ad58f"><p>Do I have to vote in every race on my ballot?</p></h3><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">No. The votes you cast will be counted even if you leave some races blank.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That being said, local and state officials can have just as much impact on your life as federal officials do &#8212; if not more &#8212; so it is worth taking the time to research the candidates and vote in those races.</p><h3 class="css-e307km e1gnsphs0" id="link-10d3196e"><p>Where and how do I vote if I moved recently?</p></h3><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Check with your state election board to see where you qualify as a legal resident, keeping in mind that the rules vary by state. To vote in New York, for example, you need to have lived there for at least 30 days before the election.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">If you want to vote in the state you moved from, request an absentee ballot right away. Most states are allowing any registered voter to request a mail-in ballot during the coronavirus pandemic, but the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">request deadlines</a> have already passed in many states.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">If you want to vote in the state you moved to, you may still be able to register there, although some states&#8217; deadlines have passed. Many states don&#8217;t require an in-state photo ID, but you will most likely need to provide proof of residency, such as a utility bill.</p></div>

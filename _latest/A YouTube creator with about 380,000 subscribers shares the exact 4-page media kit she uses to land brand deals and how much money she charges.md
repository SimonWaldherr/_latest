YouTube creator Jade Darmawangsa (381,000 subscribers) expanded her channel into a full-time business by working with brands on sponsorships.

Her social-media business mainly generates income through brand deals and the Google-placed ads that play in her YouTube videos, she told Business Insider.

On average, she charges between $2,000 and $5,000 for a YouTube brand sponsorship, and between $500 and $2,000 for a sponsored Instagram post, she said. On YouTube, her monthly earnings vary, and the most she's made from a single video is around $5,000, according to a screenshot of her dashboard viewed by Business Insider.

When trying to land brand deals, Darmawangsa uses a media kit as a tool to showcase her value to a brand or company. Media kits often contain a variety of types of information, including performance metrics, which are a key component for brands, according to Alessandro Bogliari, the cofounder and CEO of The Influencer Marketing Factory.

"When I say metrics, I don't talk only about vanity metrics (likes, comments, views) but also about conversions," he said in an email earlier this year. "A lot of brands are looking not only anymore for brand awareness but for real conversions (sign-ups, e-commerce sales, use of promo codes, etc). If we see any reference to actual important numbers and metrics in an influencer kit we know that we are talking with a professional that cares about giving real value to our client."

Darmawangsa's media kit highlights her audience demographics and some of her past work.

President Donald Trump claimed Monday that the coronavirus pandemic will 'run its course' as he prepares to return to the campaign trail with a rally in Florida this evening.

Trump is looking to jump start his re-election bid in the last three weeks of the contest and project a picture of strength after being struck with COVID.

In addition to a series of rallies this week starring himself, Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Comey Barrett's confirmation hearing starts in the Senate on Monday, which Republicans will try to use to rally the party's base.

Trump will need all the weapons in his arsenal as he returns to the business of re-election.

He's coming off a widely-panned debate performance; voters have given him low marks for his handling of the pandemic, particularly seniors, one of the most reliable voting blocs; and Democratic rival Joe Biden leads Trump in the polls - by double digits in some - as the campaign enters its final stretch.

And, as more than 215,000 Americans have died from the disease, Trump says COVID will pass. The president has consistently tried to downplay the effects of the pandemic and push the country to reopen in an effort to jump start the economy.

'Big spike in the China Plague in Europe and other places that the Fake News used to hold up as examples of places that are doing well, in order to make the U.S look bad. Be strong and vigilant, it will run its course. Vaccines and cures are coming fast!,' he wrote in a Monday morning tweet storm, where he also complained the election will be rigged and complained law enforcement is not doing enough about ANTIFA.

Trump returns to the campaign trail Monday night for the first time since being diagnosed with COVID. He'll hold a rally in Sanford, Florida, where he was scheduled to be last Friday night before tested positive for COVID.

And it's a state he needs to win if he wants a second term in the White House.

Monday also is the start of a jam-packed with of campaign stops in states crucial to his re-election. On Tuesday Trump will be in Johnston, Pa., on Wednesday in Des Moines and Thursday in Greenville, North Carolina.

But there will be no requirement for his supporters to wear masks but they will be encouraged to do so.

'We will have the same policies that we've had in place, the campaign has always handed out masks, encouraged people to wear them, provided hand sanitize or. Ultimately, you have a right in this country to show up and express your political viewpoint, that's why we have peaceful protests. You can't have one standard for the protesters out there on one side but not for those wanting to express their first amendment rights in support of this president,' White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on 'Fox & Friends' Monday morning.

Trump wants to be on the road every day until November 3.

The campaign is working to make that happen, Axios, but one adviser told the news outlet of the president: 'He's going to kill himself.'

Questions about the president's health remain.

On Saturday, President Trump held a preview of his new campaign strategy with an event at the South Lawn at the White House.

But he spoke less than 20 minutes - when his campaign rallies average 90 minutes or more - and had flesh-colored bandages on the back of his hand.

The White House has not said if the president has tested negative for COVID.

'He is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,' Trump's physician, Dr. Sean Conley, wrote in a memo on Sunday.

President Trump defended his return to the campaign trail to Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

'Well, the doctors, the White House doctors, as you know, are the best. And they said totally free of spreading. There is no spread. And there wasn't yesterday either. And, by the way, I don't know if you noticed, I was on a balcony. The closest person was probably a couple of hundred feet away. And they were down in -- on grass. There was nobody even close to me yesterday,' he said of his Saturday event.

And he touted his own recover from COVID after he spent four days in the hospital battling the disease.

'It looks like I'm immune for, I don't know, maybe a long time, or maybe a short time. It could be a lifetime. Nobody really knows. But I'm immune. So, the president is in very good shape to fight the battles,' he said.

'I knew I was free. I beat this crazy, horrible China virus,' he said.

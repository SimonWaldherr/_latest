  The US Department of Justice is putting Google's multibillion-dollar search engine deal with Apple at the centre of its antitrust case.Google pays Apple up to $12 billion a year to appear as the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices, according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday.The lawsuit cited a Google document that called the Apple search deal a "significant revenue channel," and that said losing the deal would be "Code Red" scenario.It claims Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai met in 2018 to discuss the deal.Although the DOJ acknowledged it's possible to change the default search engine on phones, it said that few users do, making Google an "exclusive" search engine and disadvantaging smaller competitors.

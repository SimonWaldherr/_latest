Business Insider dug into data from the US Department of Labor to unearth compensation information for the Mayo Clinic, one of the nation's top hospital systems.

Mayo Clinic has 65,000 employees and brings in approximately $14 billion in annual revenue.

Business Insider's analysis shows the US hospital giant Mayo Clinic hires employees in the US at salaries ranging from about $50,000 for research positions to the mid-six figures for specialized doctors.

The analysis includes positions such as specialized doctors, researchers, and nonmedical hospital staff.

The data available is a limited view of Mayo Clinic's full employee population, as it shows salary information only for employees hired through foreign-worker visas.

The Mayo Clinic, one of the most prestigious US hospital systems, pays some of its doctors well into the six figures, with some physicians commanding base salaries over $500,000.

The Rochester, Minnesota-based hospital is one of the largest health systems, with about 70,000 employees, $14 billion in annual revenue, and campuses in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida. It's the top hospital for adults in US News' annual ranking.

Business Insider used Department of Labor data to get an inside look at compensation at the Mayo Clinic. The hospital system did not respond to a request for comment.

All US companies have to disclose how much they pay employees when they hire a foreign worker for a position in the US under a permanent or temporary worker visa. From more than 6,000 visa applications found in the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2019 disclosure data, Business Insider has pulled out data for 258 applications from the Mayo Clinic covering a wide variety of positions, from research fellows and health-systems engineers to nephrologists.

The data represents only a fraction of Mayo Clinic's full employee base. The data also includes only salaries, leaving out other compensation like incentives and bonus pay.

The entries below show either a salary or salary range for an employee. Many of the positions are in Minnesota, where Mayo Clinic has its main campus, but some are on campuses in Florida and Arizona. Some positions listed had levels and were consolidated into one job title (for example, informatics specialist I and informatics specialist II were consolidated to informatics specialist).

David Gareth Benest was born in north London on April 29 1954 and educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, where he played rugby for the first XV. In 1973, after Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Parachute Regiment and posted to 2 Para in South Armagh.

He commanded a platoon which, as he said later, was “shoved into the deep end” of the Cold War when it took part in a large parachute and marine landing in Turkey. On an exercise in north Germany, he and his men were dropped close to the Kiel Canal. The timing was misjudged, the canal was still in use and the pilots flying overhead in the darkness mistook the ships’ lights for those of the dropping zone. Benest just missed the canal but six TA soldiers were drowned.

He returned to Sandhurst for six months after applying for a Regular Commission and then served as a company operations officer in a particularly dangerous republican area of Belfast during 1976 and 1977.

For the next three years, he read for an in-service degree in International Relations at the University of Keele and graduated with First Class Honours. Part of each vacation was spent as a company second in command with 2 Para who were then operating in South Armagh and Fermanagh.

In July 1981, he returned to 2 Para as regimental signals officer, a post he held during training in Kenya and the Falklands conflict. On a six-month tour in Belize, he managed communications between HQ, foot patrols and helicopter jungle patrols.

After Staff College, he spent two years at the MoD where he played a key part in the provision of equipment and communication systems needed for the formation of a new Border Brigade in Northern Ireland.

He enjoyed the stimulus of working with scientists on the application of technology in counter-terrorist operations and was appointed MBE at the end of his tour.

He then commanded a company of 3 Para, operating mainly in West Belfast and South Down and was appointed second in command for the final six months. In 1991, he received the General Officer Commanding’s Commendation for outstanding service.

In the absence of any guidance, he said later, and after his experience in Northern Ireland, he developed his own doctrine as regards ethics and military duty.

He spoke to his platoons, his company and, in due course, his battalion, to press home the awesome responsibility of using military power and authority to apply lethal force. Where a life was endangered, a young soldier could, in effect, be witness, prosecutor, judge, jury – and executioner – in a split second.

After another year at the MoD, in 1994 he assumed command of 2 Para. The three-year tour included six months in South Armagh where the Battalion had the advantage of towers established close to the border which provided a combination of radar, thermal and visual surveillance, the product of his time at the MoD. He was advanced to OBE.

His parachuting days, however, were over. They were an ordeal, he said afterwards. There was always the fear, not of injury, but of panic and failure. This never happened but on various occasions he hanged himself by his parachute strap, knocked himself out, broke an ankle and regularly “ploughed in”.

He was appointed Director Defence Studies (Army) and, in 2005, Director of Security Studies and Resilience within the Defence College of Management Technology. In 2008, he was posted to Afghanistan as the counter-insurgency adviser at the British Embassy, Kabul.

Former comrades who have written tell of his unfailing kindness and support to the soldiers under his command who, in turn, respected him. There is no doubt that he felt things very deeply. Highly intelligent, widely read and sure of his facts, he was never afraid to speak his mind in forthright terms and challenge conventional wisdom.

His concept of an Army career was that of total commitment to those with whom he served and unflagging pursuit of his ideals. Recurring strain led to a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. There are suggestions that he was haunted by the loss of life in the Falklands battles and that the names and faces of those who died never left him.

In 1982, he was tasked with writing up the battalion history of the Falklands campaign, which formed the basis of 2 Para – Falklands: The Battalion at War (1983) by Major General John Frost. Benest’s determination to pin down the truth led him to rework the original manuscript in recent years, with the support of his sister, Jacquetta, and to entrust it to the National Army Museum for safe-keeping.

He retired from the Army in 2009 after 37 years’ service. In retirement in a village in Wiltshire, he was chairman of his local parish council for four years. He gave generous support to other military historians and did not hesitate to put forward his views to the national press, mainly on the subject of military ethics.

As a younger man, he loved rock climbing and ski-mountaineering. Walking holidays with friends, listening to music and cooking were other enjoyable activities. Above all, however, he relished a lively debate over lunch with friends, neighbours or former comrades, whether about the Falklands, military history, his campaign for a British Army underpinned by unshakeable moral principles or his passion for social justice within the education system.

David Benest married, in 1987, Genevieve (Gee) Clarke, who was a stalwart support to him throughout their married life.

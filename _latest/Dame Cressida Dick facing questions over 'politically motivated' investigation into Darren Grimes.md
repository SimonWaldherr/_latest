Dame Cressida Dick is set to be grilled by MPs over the Metropolitan Police’s decision to launch a “politically motivated” investigation into Darren Grimes.

There has been outrage over the decision to interview under caution the conservative commentator for broadcasting an interview with Dr David Starkey in which the historian used the phrase “damn blacks”.

The 27-year-old is accused of stirring up racial hatred with the podcast, which was published on his Reasoned UK YouTube channel on June 30.

Now Scotland Yard’s commissioner could face questions over the decision to investigate. Tory MP Tim Loughton said he will raise the case with the Home Affairs Select Committee, on which he sits, when they meet on Wednesday.

“We are due to have Cressida Dick in in due course and this is another reason to question her,” Mr Loughton told the Telegraph.

“It looks like a deeply political decision and we need to find out if it went all the way to the top and her fingerprints are on it.”

He said that the police are “shooting the messenger” and if Mr Grimes is guilty of anything it is “being an amateur interviewer” who did not pull Dr Starkey up on his remarks.

The fact that other offensive remarks have gone unquestioned by police, such as a comedienne encouraged people to “kill whitey” on the BBC, shows that this is “double standards”, Mr Loughton added.

“That is why this does seem to smack of a degree of political correctness and a singling out of Darren Grimes,” Mr Loughton said. “This seems to be a completely vexatious investigation and we need the police to be doing rather more important things.”

There is no date set for Dame Cressida's appearance before MPs, but Mr Loughton said that this was a reason to "speed that up".

Since the Telegraph revealed that Mr Grimes had received a request to attend a police station to be interviewed under caution for an offence under the public order act, there have been widespread warnings that the investigation could have a chilling effect on freedom of speech.

Sajid Javid, the former Home Secretary, described it as “absurd” whilst his replacement Priti Patel said that she could not comment on operational matters but “it’s important the law protects freedom of speech”.

It has been reported that Ministers are becoming increasingly concerned over “police activism”.

It is understood the Ben Bradley, the Tory MP for Mansfield, will attempt to raise the issue with an urgent question in Parliament.

He said: “I don’t know what the Met Police and the wider establishment have against Darren, but a criminal investigation against a broadcaster/commentator for something an interviewee said is absolutely unfathomable in a country that has freedom of speech and freedom of the press.”

Mr Bradley described the case as “utterly mad” and said he would be “asking Government to fix our dodgy legal system”.

 <p>     </p> <p> This is exactly what one mum called Shirl does, and she's been praised for admitting it, reports <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8861537/Mum-shows-kids-lunchboxes-REALLY-look-like-days-shes-exhausted.html" rel="nofollow">Femail.</a></p> <p> The Australian parent took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> to share a snap of her kids lunchboxes filled with "plastic and pre-packaged snacks, complete with cash for a lunch order". </p> <p>Alongside the photo, she explained that "we all have those days" when we are just "too busy, too tired and too broke" to whip up a perfect meal.</p> <p> She added: "This is for all the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting">mummas</a> out there who see these posts of amazing, creative and balanced lunches but are too busy, too tired or too broke to do the same. </p> <p>"We all have these days! You know what, my child is fed and at the end of the day, fed is best."</p>

   <p>Her incredibly honest post really hit home with fellow social media users and quickly went viral.</p> <p>One parent replied: "That's exactly what I think. It's hard to get some kids to eat."</p> <p>Another commented: "My daughter just started back at school yesterday. I'm very proud of her because she gets lunches like this and never complains. She has never complained since she started daycare and now she's nine.</p> <p>"It makes me feel so humbled to know that even though her friends have these lunchboxes with bento parts, that she still doesn't complain and is content with what she gets."</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>A number of others agreed with these statements and thought some parents and teachers should be less "judgemental" about the contents of lunchboxes.</p> <p>"I work two jobs and struggle to find the time to cook dinner let alone make amazing lunches every day," added a different user.</p> <p><strong> Do you have a story to share?

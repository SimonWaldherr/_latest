  The pointless imposition of Tier-3 restrictions will leave Manchester in despair

<div><p>What metropolitan politicians seem unable to grasp is that our pubs and bars are not places from which the bladdered fall out&#160;at closing time. Rather,&#160;most people in&#160;Greater Manchester&#160;enjoy&#160;their local as a place to idle over a drink and&#160;connect with others. These are cosy places where&#160;if anybody doesn't know your name&#160;then they'll ask in a heartbeat.&#160;What's more, as&#160;an antidote to loneliness &#8211; especially&#160;if working from home or isolated from family &#8211; our pubs play a vital role.</p>
<p>It's all so utterly pointless. In&#160;July, Manchester was placed&#160;in local lockdown.&#160;Yet virus rates continued to climb. Such parochial fire-fighting was useless. Meanwhile, the&#160;reservoir of good will and fear that&#160;framed the early stages of the virus drained away. The latest move&#160;is a soul-destroying&#160;cap to an ineffectual protocol.</p>
<p>Valiant though <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/enraged-andy-burnham-rueful-boris-johnson-day-total-covid-chaos/">Andy Burnham</a> has been in trying to secure funding, his Cicero-in-a-kagool oratory should have pushed a different message: Don't close us down. Let us deploy focused protection &#8211; advising those with background health issues or of a certain age that they are vulnerable. Forget closing times. Let this demographic decide whether they want to take the risk&#160;&#8211; especially given that the hospitality industry has spent thousands introducing Covid safety measures.</p>
<p>Instead of pointless lockdowns, we should place laser emphasis on mask-wearing, hand-washing and the need to observe social distancing. We have to learn to live with the virus.&#160;</p>

UNCASVILLE, Conn. – Steve Mowry continues to impress, but isn’t keen on using this opportunity to shoot his shot just yet.

Mowry (8-0 MMA, 4-0 BMMA) extended his unbeaten record with a first-round finish of former CFFC champ Shawn Teed at Bellator 249.

Mowry’s fight with Teed was promoted to the main card after the lightweight co-main event matchup between Patricky Freire and Jaleel Willis was scrapped off the card, and Mowry took the opportunity to showcase his skills in a higher-profile spot. But, despite continuing his rise up the rankings with another finish, he declined the opportunity to issue a post-fight callout.

Speaking on the Bellator 249 post-fight show, Mowry said, “I’m not a name guy. I don’t say names, I don’t bully, I don’t name-call. Everybody that I get put in the cage with, I’m gonna try to finish, I’m gonna try to take out.

“As for getting off the prelims and getting on the main card, I really feel like if there was a time to do it, it was today. Shawn Teed was a champion in a promotion before this, he was a really accomplished fighter. I think they made a really good signing when they picked him up and if you’re gonna have two guys get their bump to the main card on a Bellator show, especially the first one on CBS, not to toot my own horn or anything, but I think Shawn Teed and I were the guys to do it.”

Most of Mowry’s wins have come by submission and although he scored his fifth first-round finish, he knows he has more to offer.

“I wanted the first knockout,” he said. “I was just trying to do the stuff that I drill every day. I feel like I wasn’t perfect, but I feel like I did about a B- job compared to how I normally perform at the gym. I really was just trying to put my full skillset on display and the grappling didn’t come into play, which kinda was the game plan for me. But no, I wasn’t planning on anything, I was just gonna go in there and fight.”

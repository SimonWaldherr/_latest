<div><p>Quibi, the short-form video app founded by Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, is calling it quits just six months after its launch, according to reports.</p>
<p>The high-profile startup &#8212; which raised a whopping $1.75 billion for an ill-fated launch this spring that coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic across the US &#8212; is shutting down amid slumping demand for its short-form videos, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quibi-weighs-shutting-down-as-problems-mount-11603301946" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Wall Street Journal reported</a> Wednesday.</p>
<p>The shutdown marks a shocking end to Hollywood mogul Katzenberg&#8217;s plan to create a new category of entertainment that catered to people on the go. In a bid to create a high-profile library of short videos &#8212; most of them just a few minutes long &#8212; Katzenberg had lured A-list stars like Jennifer Lopez, Kevin Hart and Nick Jonas.</p>
<p>The Journal said the former Disney exec was informing investors that the company is closing after it recently hired a restructuring firm to evaluate its options.</p>
<p>A Quibi spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Reports of Quibi&#8217;s closure followed an article on Tuesday from The Information that claimed Katzenberg had tried to sell Quibi&#8217;s catalog of programming to companies such as NBCUniversal and Facebook, without any success.</p>
<p>Sources told The Post that Katzenberg has been telling people in Hollywood that he might have to shut down the company. According to The Information, Quibi staffers have been cancelling &#8220;important strategy meetings&#8221; and have been &#8220;informally scheduling goodbye drinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a giant meltdown,&#8221; said Eric Schiffer, chief executive of private equity firm The Patriarch Organization. &#8220;It is a modern-day Hindenburg within the digital and entertainment arena.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiffer said it is likely that Quibi opts for a so-called &#8220;ABC liquidation,&#8221; or assignment for the benefit of creditors. Such a liquidation would allow Katzenberg and chief executive officer Meg Whitman to avoid the stench of bankruptcy, and assign Quibi&#8217;s assets to a third party. That third party would then sell off the assets and pay off creditors.</p>
<p>Schiffer noted that Quibi&#8217;s content library, which includes a courtroom reality show with Chrissy Teigen, called &#8220;Chrissy&#8217;s Court,&#8221; &#8220;The Andy Cohen Diaries,&#8221; an animated show based on Cohen&#8217;s journals and a horror anthology from Sam Raimi called &#8220;50 States of Fright,&#8221; will likely be sold at &#8220;fire sale prices,&#8221; &#8220;percentages on the dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>News of Quibi&#8217;s demise began trickling in last month amid rumors of <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/21/jeffrey-katzenbergs-quibi-app-is-exploring-a-sale-report-says/">a strategic review of the company</a>. Hampered by stiff competition from the likes of streaming giants Netflix, Disney+, short-form video apps YouTube and TikTok, Quibi was never able to meaningfully grow its subscriber base. With lower-than-expected viewership, blue chip advertisers like PepsiCo, Walmart and Anheuser Busch, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/quibi-advertisers-already-wary-of-streaming-service/">began deferring their payments</a>.</p>
<p>Quibi is also facing <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/16/jeffrey-katzenberg-resorting-to-unusual-tactics-to-avoid-quibi-suit/">a high-stakes lawsuit</a> from rival Eko, which is funded by billionaire backer Paul Singer.</p>
<p>A month into business, Katzenberg <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/12/jeffrey-katzenberg-blames-coronavirus-for-quibis-poor-start/">blamed the coronavirus</a> for Quibi&#8217;s poor start, complaining that the app is meant to be watched via smartphone in on the go situations.</p>
<p>Media critics did not buy that logic, as house-bound customers have more free time to watch shows than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly you drop your phone because you&#8217;re at home? It&#8217;s not logical,&#8221; said Schiffer.</p>
<p>Tal Chalozin, the co-founder and chief technology officer of online advertising and tech firm Innovid, said coronavirus lockdowns actually boosted the viewership of services like Netflix, Hulu, Snap and Disney+.</p>
<p>&#8220;Viewership is at an all-time high even if ad dollars are limited,&#8221; he said, noting that the real problem was that Katzenberg tried to launch a service with an unknown brand and limited content.</p>
<p>With all the well-known rivals already out there, he said that it is &#8220;close to impossible&#8221; to succeed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The window is closing if not closed already on streaming services &#8212; especially an unbranded one,&#8221; he said.</p>

  Northern Hemisphere endures its hottest summer on record 
description: > 
  (CNN) If you thought it's been hotter than usual, you would be correct, because the Northern Hemisphere just had its hottest summer on record.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that not only was it the hottest summer, but it was the globe's third hottest three-month season on record and August was the second-hottest month ever.NOAA's monthly global report said that August 2020 was only behind August 2016 as the hottest month on record.However, when it comes to the Northern Hemisphere, it's a different story.August 2020 beat August 2016 as the hottest month ever recorded with a temperature average of 2.14 degrees Fahrenheit over the 20th century average of 60.1 degrees Fahrenheit.

Rising temperatures are making droughts and fires more widespread. And the Northern Hemisphere has a large majority of the Earth's land and population.

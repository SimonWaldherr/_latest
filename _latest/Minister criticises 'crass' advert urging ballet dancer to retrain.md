A Government minister has expressed his regret for a “crass” advertisement which suggested ballet dancers will need to retrain.

The poster, designed to promote retraining in cybersecurity, featured a young dancer called Fatima tying up her ballet pumps and suggested she could "reboot" her career.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the controversial marketing material had not been devised by his department and reiterated his support for the arts.

He tweeted: “To those tweeting re #Fatima. This is not something from DCMS & I agree it was crass.

“This was a partner campaign encouraging people from all walks of life to think about a career in cyber security.”

A Government source suggested there was no political sign off on the poster.

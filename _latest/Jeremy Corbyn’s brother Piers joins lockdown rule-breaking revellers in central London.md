  Jeremy Corbyn’s brother Piers joins lockdown rule-breaking revellers in central London 
description: > 
  Jeremy Corbyn’s brother joined revellers and protesters in central London on Friday as police were forced to break up big groups breaking new lockdown rules, and hours before the capital entered the “high” tier 2 category.Large crowds gathered around bars and restaurants in Soho last night after the 10pm closing time as officers were forced to break up the groups not adhering to social distancing guidelines.Among the rule-breakers was Piers Corbyn, brother of former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who encouraged people to join him for “music, drinking and dancing” in the central London hotspot.Piers Corbyn was fined £10,000 in August after helping to organise an anti-lockdown protest in London.The new regulations could be devastating for the more than 5,000 pubs and around 8,500 restaurants in tier 2 regions, including the capital.

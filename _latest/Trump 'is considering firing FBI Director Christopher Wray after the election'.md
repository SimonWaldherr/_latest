  President Donald Trump is reportedly considering firing FBI Director Christopher Wray after the election as he grows increasingly frustrated with the bureau's handling of the Hunter Biden email scandal.Wray's future is seen as uncertain because Trump has already fired one FBI director and has repeatedly lashed out at Wray.If he wins, he could seek an FBI director more willing to back his political agenda.It's hardly unusual for tension to exist between a president and FBI director.'There's always been a unanimity of position between the FBI director, the attorney general and the White House, and they've always been able to jointly push back on Congress,' Brower said.

It cited Justice Department policy in declining to confirm or deny investigations.</p><img id="i-cafed579c7c8e35" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="Sources told the Washington Post that Trump's frustrations with Wray deepened in recent days as he and Attorney General Bill Barr failed to announce an investigation into potential corruption by Joe Biden and his son Hunter (above together)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-cafed579c7c8e35" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/22/06/34598874-8865121-Joe_Biden_and_his_son_Hunter_are_facing_renewed_scrutiny_related-a-6_1603343290480.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Sources told the Washington Post that Trump's frustrations with Wray deepened in recent days as he and Attorney General Bill Barr failed to announce an investigation into potential corruption by Joe Biden and his son Hunter (above together)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Sources told the Washington Post that Trump's frustrations with Wray deepened in recent days as he and Attorney General Bill Barr failed to announce an investigation into potential corruption by Joe Biden and his son Hunter (above together)&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even as Wray has angered Trump by contradicting him on some issues, the FBI has eagerly highlighted his cooperation on others critical for Republicans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That includes pointing out his compliance with document demands from congressional Republicans looking to discredit the Trump-Russia investigation, and the FBI's cooperation with a prosecutor whose investigation into the origins of that probe led to charges against a former FBI lawyer for altering an email.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">FBI spokesman Brian Hale said in a statement that it's important for Americans 'to know that we have been transparent and cooperative with congressional oversight inquiries and Department of Justice reviews', including those of the probe into whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 election.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said the FBI is committed to providing information about the 'important work being performed by our 37,000 employees located in 56 field offices across the country and stationed all over the world'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wray's future is seen as uncertain because Trump has already fired one FBI director and has repeatedly lashed out at Wray.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said last week that Wray is 'not doing a very good job' if he won't acknowledge the possibility of rampant voter fraud, which Wray and other officials and experts have disputed as being a widespread problem.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's unclear if Trump would fire Wray after the election. If he wins, he could seek an FBI director more willing to back his political agenda. If he loses, Republican lawmakers may encourage him to keep Wray on board rather than leave Biden with a vacancy to fill himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Biden has not said if he would replace Wray. But presidents have generally respected the 10-year terms of FBI directors, a tenure designed to ensure the bureau&#180;s political independence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's hardly unusual for tension to exist between a president and FBI director. But Wray's job is all the more difficult given Trump's very public expectations of loyalty and that the levers of law enforcement be used against political enemies.</p><img id="i-986e183cc4a29dab" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="634" alt="Wray's future is seen as uncertain because Trump has already fired one FBI director and has repeatedly lashed out at Wray (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-986e183cc4a29dab" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/21/21/wire-34680446-1603313501-323_634x422.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Wray's future is seen as uncertain because Trump has already fired one FBI director and has repeatedly lashed out at Wray (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Wray's future is seen as uncertain because Trump has already fired one FBI director and has repeatedly lashed out at Wray (pictured)&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then-FBI Director James Comey found himself in a precarious position as Trump took office with his campaign under investigation for its ties to Russia.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Comey placated Trump to a degree by privately reassuring him that he was not under investigation, but balked at requests to state that publicly.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was fired in 2017, an action that became central to the special counsel&#180;s investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct the Russia probe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wray has approached his position in a non-flashy manner, preaching what one former senior FBI official described as a 'head down, tackle hard' ethic.

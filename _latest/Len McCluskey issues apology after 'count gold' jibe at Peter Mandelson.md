  Len McCluskey issues apology after 'count gold' jibe at Peter Mandelson 
description: > 
  Len McCluskey has been forced to apologise after he was accused of levelling an anti-Semitic trope at Labour grandee Lord Mandelson.The Unite general secretary was on Tuesday facing a widespread backlash after telling the Blair era minister, who is of Jewish descent, to leave politics and “count his gold.”His incendiary remarks came after he was asked about Lord Mandelson’s praise for new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.Responding, Mr McCluskey, a prominent ally of Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Newsnight: “I would suggest that Peter just goes into a room and counts his gold and not worry about what’s happening in the Labour Party.“Leave that to those of us that are interested in ordinary working people.”His comments provoked an immediate outcry among leading Jewish and Labour figures, including veteran MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who said: “Why McCluskey uses tropes that many would consider anti-Semitic on BBC Newsnight is a question only he can answer.“Regardless, he doesn’t get to obfuscate and dictate to us what is and is not anti-Semitic when called out.”

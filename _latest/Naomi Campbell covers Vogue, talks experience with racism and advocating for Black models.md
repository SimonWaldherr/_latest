"I never wanted people to say that I used that as an excuse, that I was throwing that word out. Now I&#8217;m happy that everyone&#8217;s all on the same page, that everyone feels comfortable to come out about their experiences without feeling some stigma. But for me, nothing&#8217;s changed.

"Is it now that we have permission to speak? Well, I have always spoken."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She continued, "There were a few things that I would do when I was younger that I was told were bad for my race&#8230; Now the things I do are not just for me anymore.

"I&#8217;d rather have racism be right in front of my face and know what I&#8217;m dealing with, than to have it suppressed.

I absolutely believe we are going to get the positive outcome we deserve," she said. "But we have to do our work in making sure we get it.

How do you start writing?&#8217; And he told me, &#8216;Just start from anywhere.

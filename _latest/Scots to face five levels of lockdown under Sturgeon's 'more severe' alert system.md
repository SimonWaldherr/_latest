  Scots to face five levels of lockdown under Sturgeon's 'more severe' alert system 
description: > 
  Scots in areas with severe Covid outbreaks will face being placed into near-full lockdowns under a new five-tier system to be unveiled by Nicola Sturgeon this week.The Daily Telegraph understands that the First Minister’s version of Boris Johnson’s “traffic light” system will include two more alert levels than in England, including an upper “extreme” tier as well as a lower “tier zero”, under which life would resemble pre-pandemic normality.Those living in an area with the highest level would experience restrictions almost as severe as the full lockdown imposed across the UK in March, when there was a ‘stay at home’ message and draconian limits on travel.The other three middle tiers are likely to broadly mirror the English system.While schools would not automatically close if their area entered the top alert level, a “judgement” would be made on a case by case basis over whether pupils would be sent home.

<div><p>Scots in areas with severe Covid outbreaks will face being placed into near-full lockdowns under a new five-tier system to be unveiled by Nicola Sturgeon this week.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph understands that the First Minister&#8217;s version of Boris Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;traffic light&#8221; system will include two more alert levels than in England, including an upper &#8220;extreme&#8221; tier as well as a lower &#8220;tier zero&#8221;, under which life would resemble pre-pandemic normality.&#160;</p>
<p>Those living in an area with the highest level would experience restrictions almost as severe as the full lockdown imposed across the UK in March, when there was a &#8216;stay at home&#8217; message and draconian limits on travel. The other three middle tiers are likely to broadly mirror the English system.</p>
<p>While schools would not automatically close if their area entered the top alert level, a &#8220;judgement&#8221; would be made on a case by case basis over whether pupils would be sent home.</p>
<p>No areas will be placed into the top level initially under current proposals, although Central Belt locations with high virus rates are likely to be placed in the second top tier when the system comes into force on November 2, meaning continued restrictions on hospitality venues.</p>
<p>The detail of the new system is likely to<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/20/scottish-pub-owners-warn-businesses-wont-viable-restrictions/"> dismay hospitality businesses</a> in the Central Belt, which were told earlier this month that they would have to shut for just 16 days, but now face a period of indefinite closure.</p>
<p>The First Minister is set to announce today that temporary restrictions on pubs and restaurants that were due to come to an end on Monday are to be extended for a week, with her new tiered system to then come into force immediately afterwards .</p>

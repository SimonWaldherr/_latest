  MTA’s new ‘live’ subway map lets you see where trains are in real time 
description: > 
  The MTA on Tuesday launched a new “live” online subway map, which allows straphangers to see where trains are in the system in real time — and adjusts the lines to reflect service changes.The map — available on desktop and mobile at map.mta.info and through the MyMTA app — draws elements from the current “static” subway map from 1979, and the infamous “diagram” designed by Massimo Vignelli in the early 70s.“The good thing about it is that this is combining the actual subway stations with whether you’re able to catch a particular train at a particular time.In the old-fashioned map, you had to look at a whole slew of information,” Bronzaft said.Still, Bronzaft said the “live” map may prove too high tech for some.

<div><p>The MTA on Tuesday launched a new &#8220;live&#8221; online subway map, which allows straphangers to see where trains are in the system in real time &#8212; and adjusts the lines to reflect service changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No longer will people have to decipher a range of in-station signs &#8212; you can plan your commute from the palm of your hand,&#8221; interim New York City Transit president Sarah Feinberg said at a press conference unveiling the map on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The map &#8212; available on desktop and mobile at <a href="https://map.mta.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">map.mta.info</a> and through the MyMTA app &#8212; draws elements from the current &#8220;static&#8221; subway map from 1979, and <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/29/mta-testing-subway-map-makeover-at-brooklyn-station/">the infamous &#8220;diagram&#8221; designed</a> by Massimo Vignelli in the early 70s.</p>
<p>In addition to gray rectangles representing trains moving along the rails, straphangers will be able to see service-changes &#8212; so if the E train is running on the F line, as it often does, the map will show that.</p>
<p>Riders can also toggle between weekday, weeknight and weekend maps to plan their trips in advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all had that experience when we get on the train that Saturday morning. Sit down. Read a book, take a look at your iPhone, and then look up and see through the window that we&#8217;re at a different station than we might have expected to be at,&#8221; MTA Chief Customer Officer Sarah Meyer told reports.</p>

<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t happen anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Psychologist Arline Bronzaft, who helped create and test the 1979 map, praised the MTA for synthesizing what was previously disparate information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good thing about it is that this is combining the actual subway stations with whether you&#8217;re able to catch a particular train at a particular time. That&#8217;s always been a problem. In the old-fashioned map, you had to look at a whole slew of information,&#8221; Bronzaft said.</p>
<p>Still, Bronzaft said the &#8220;live&#8221; map may prove too high tech for some.</p>

 
	<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not computer savvy &#8212; have they made sure that the people that are not computer savvy can use our system and are able to navigate that?&#8221; she told The Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to test it out.&#8221;</p>

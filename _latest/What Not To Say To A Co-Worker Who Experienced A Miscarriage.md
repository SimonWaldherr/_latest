<p>People came forward with their own experiences, and it became a reminder that although pregnancy loss is common, there is still not a shared understanding of how to talk about it.</p><p>Not everyone feels comfortable sharing information about a pregnancy with colleagues. And while some commenters on Twitter thanked Teigen and Legend for going public with their story and including remembrance photos, others questioned the decision, perhaps not understanding<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/remembrance-photos-pregnancy-loss-stillbirth_l_5f7690d8c5b6dd94f1e8457b" target="_blank"> how such images can play a powerful role in the healing process</a> for bereaved parents.</p><p>It&#8217;s likely that you work with someone who has gone through this experience or may someday. Up to 20% of pregnancies end in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pregnancy-loss-miscarriage/symptoms-causes/syc-20354298" target="_blank">miscarriages</a>, and there are 2.6 million <a href="https://www.who.int/life-course/partners/global-strategy/ewec-globalstrategyreport-200915.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank">stillbirths</a> around the world each year. </p><p>When a loss is acknowledged in the office, it&#8217;s important to be supportive, and the primary thing to understand is that pregnancy loss can take a real emotional toll. According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161102080121.htm">study</a> by Imperial College London, 4 in 10 women reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder three months after their miscarriage, and 30% said this stress affected their work life.</p><p>If you are wondering how to support a colleague going through such a loss, consider first what not to say: </p><p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "><h3>1. Even if you&#8217;re religious, don&#8217;t say it was God&#8217;s plan. </h3></p><p>When speaking with a co-worker grieving a pregnancy loss, it is really important to keep anything remotely religious out of the conversation, said <a href="https://greaterwashingtontherapy.com/julie-bindeman-psyd/" target="_blank">Julie Bindeman</a>, a reproductive psychologist based in Rockville, Maryland. </p><p>&#8220;This can be hard for well-intentioned people that have a deep faith and truly believe ideas like, &#8216;This happened for a reason,&#8217;&#8221; Bindeman said. &#8220;For the majority of people that have experienced a pregnancy loss, hearing such a platitude makes them angry and [feel] misunderstood.&#8221;</p><p>When you&#8217;re wondering what to say, let the person going through the pregnancy loss lead. &#8220;Take your cues from the bereaved parent,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.therapistsinphiladelphia.com/meet-us/rayna-markin/" target="_blank">Rayna Markin</a>, a psychologist and associate professor in counseling at Villanova University. &#8220;Some bereaved parents will not want to talk about their loss in the workplace, whereas for others, a condolence card, flowers, a simple &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry for your loss&#8217; helps them to feel supported and less alone.&#8221;</p><p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "><h3>2. Avoid &#8220;at least...&#8221; comments.</h3></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ihadamiscarriage/" target="_blank">Jessica Zucker</a>, a Los Angeles-based psychologist who specializes in maternal mental health, said comments like &#8220;At least you know you can get pregnant, at least you have a healthy child, at least you have a thriving career, at least you were ambivalent about having another one&#8221; are minimizing. </p><p>&#8220;&#8216;At least&#8217; is not a compassionate way to start a sentence,&#8221; Zucker said. What people are often trying to convey with &#8220;at least you know you can get pregnant&#8221; is encouragement that it will happen again, she said, but no one can say this with certainty. </p><p>Additionally, &#8220;at least&#8221; comments minimize the experience of people who wanted the pregnancy. &#8220;They wanted this pregnancy, so letting someone know they got pregnant and therefore they will again is just painful,&#8221; Zucker said. </p><p>In general, avoid platitudes that &#8220;unintentionally minimize or invalidate the bereaved parent&#8217;s loss, such as, &#8216;It happens all the time, it&#8217;s for the best, time heals all wounds,&#8217;&#8221; Markin said. </p><p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "><h3>3. But don&#8217;t magnify the loss, either. </h3></p><blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"><p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"></p><p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli">&#8220;I had someone tell me, 'I would die if what happened to you happened to me'...The truth is, we have to survive what we go through, so hearing that doesn't help.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Zucker said colleagues should not assume that the loss is devastating, either. </p><p>&#8220;I had someone tell me, &#8216;I would die if what happened to you happened to me,&#8217;&#8221; said Zucker, who personally experienced a miscarriage at 16 weeks. &#8220;The truth is, we have to survive what we go through, so hearing that doesn&#8217;t help.&#8221;</p><p>Instead of comparing and contrasting your own experience of loss to your co-worker&#8217;s, Zucker said you should stay open about what you don&#8217;t know with language like, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been through this, I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re feeling. Do you want to share with me?&#8221; </p><p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "><h3>4. Do not say nothing.</h3></p><p>Bindeman said she has heard from clients who had co-workers they felt close to but who never acknowledged their loss. &#8220;Oftentimes, this is because the person just doesn&#8217;t know what to say, so rather than not be helpful, they stay silent,&#8221; Bindeman said. </p><p>But this can be one of the biggest mistakes colleagues can make. Bindeman said acknowledgment can simply sound like, &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry for your loss.&#8221; Not everyone wants to talk about a pregnancy they lost, Bindeman said, but many do.</p><p>Showing support is not a one-time action, either. If you have a close relationship to your grieving colleague, remember to check in after the initial conversation.</p><p>&#8220;What becomes hard is that once a few weeks pass and things look &#8216;back to normal,&#8217; others tend to forget the loss has ever happened, whereas the parent that experienced the loss continues to remember, and feels isolated by others forgetting,&#8221; Bindeman said, noting that this experience is individual and some people are uncomfortable and private about their losses.</p><p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "><h3>If you&#8217;re a manager, you need to get specific.</h3></p><p>If you are a boss or manager, being compassionate means listening to your employee&#8217;s needs and offering the same accommodations that follow any other loss.</p><p>&#8220;Treating pregnancy loss like any other kind of loss helps to validate the parent&#8217;s loss as real and grief as legitimate,&#8221; Markin said. For example, giving a colleague time off from work to mourn and asking him or her how you can best support them are two options bosses can offer, she said. </p><p>In fact, if you&#8217;re a boss, treating your employee differently by refusing to accommodate them after a pregnancy loss can be illegal under the <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section2000e&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</a>, which covers mistreatment of pregnancy-related medical conditions like miscarriage or stillbirth. Under the bill, at companies with 15 or more employees in America, a boss cannot demote, cut hours or fire an employee for experiencing a pregnancy loss. </p><p>It&#8217;s key for managers to recognize the power differential in conversations after a loss. An employee may be concerned that disclosing a pregnancy loss could signal a loss in productivity, for example. A compassionate boss would put those concerns to rest by making it clear to an employee that taking time off work and doing less is more than acceptable. </p><p>But bosses should also not assume what their employees need and take them off a work project. Some people see working as a reprieve from their grief, Zucker said.</p><blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"><p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"></p><p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli">&#8220;Support is not a one-time action. If you have a close relationship to your grieving colleague, remember to check in after the initial conversation.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Bosses should also be sensitive to other pregnancies within teams. Bindeman noted that if office baby showers are a company ritual and one is being planned, they can give the grieving co-worker a heads up, making it clear that attendance is optional and asking the person if they want to be on emails about the shower. </p><p>What bosses can do to help is to overall make it clear that this experience is common. A person who has just experienced pregnancy loss doesn&#8217;t want to feel that their boss and colleagues are &#8220;walking on eggshells,&#8221; Zucker said, because they did nothing wrong. </p><p>&#8220;This is just something that happens a lot. Ideally [the boss will] put that out there, so it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;re also worried about &#8213; &#8216;Is my boss going to be mad that I have another doctor&#8217;s appointment for a follow-up?&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Instead, managers should already have assured their colleague that they can take as much time as needed to grieve. </p></div>

More than a dozen people were shot in the Big Apple over the Saturday and Sunday, including two fatally, as the yearlong spike in gunplay continued.

Gotham’s latest shooting death came around 1:20 a.m. Sunday on the Lower East Side, when police responding to a report of shots fired found 26-year-old Tyrell Williams with a bullet wound to the chest at East 13th Street and Avenue A, cops said.

Williams was taken to Mount Sinai Beth Isreal Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Several hours earlier, shortly before 11 p.m. on Saturday, another 26-year-old man was found unresponsive with a gunshot wound to the head on Post Avenue in Hudson Heights, police said. The victim was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Police said a 28-year-old man was taken into custody and a gun was recovered at the scene.

That incident was one of five shootings with seven victims on Saturday, followed by seven more shootings through midday Sunday.

The most recent non-fatal shooting took place just after 5:30 a.m. Sunday morning in the lobby of a building at 1985 Webster Avenue in the Bronx, when a 29-year-old man was struck in the stomach during an undetermined dispute, cops said.

He was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital and was expected to survive.

Less than a half-hour earlier, another man, 27, was hit in the neck and chest while driving on 149th Street and Southern Boulevard, with the alleged gunman fleeing the scene. The victim was taken to Lincoln Hospital.

At 1:51 a.m. a man took a bullet to the lower back on Union Street in Brooklyn, where police recovered seven shell casings but reported that the victim was “highly uncooperative” with officers.

Two other shootings took place less than five minutes apart around 12:45 a.m. Sunday, police said.

One man, 36, was shot in the leg during a dispute at the Movie Star Cuts barbershop on Merrick Boulevard in Jamaica — but was also uncooperative with police, the department said.

At around the same time in Brooklyn, a 25-year-old man was hit in the nose and taken to Kings County Hospital for treatment.

And Sunday’s first shooting took place at 12:25 a.m.

In that case, a 38-year-old man walked into Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn with two gunshot wounds to his right arm, police said.

Cops said there was an earlier shot spotter activation in front of St. John’s Place, where four shell casings were recovered.

The early Sunday spree came after seven people were shot in five incidents on Saturday, including the one homicide, police said.

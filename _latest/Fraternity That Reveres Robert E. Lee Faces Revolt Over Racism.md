  Fraternity That Reveres Robert E. Lee Faces Revolt Over Racism 
description: > 
  Kappa Alpha, one of the nation’s largest and oldest college fraternities, is not unaccustomed to fending off charges of racism.Its embrace of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, as a “spiritual founder” has rankled students and faculty members.Black student groups have protested its antebellum-themed spring formals.One campus demanded an apology after Kappa Alphas recited a chant lamenting the Union victory in the Civil War.But the killing of George Floyd has for the first time sparked a racial reappraisal within the fraternity’s own chapters.

And the decision by Kappa Alpha&#8217;s national organization to suspend the chapter for its criticism of the fraternity&#8217;s racial profile has angered even some Black students on the Georgetown, Tex., campus who have not typically regarded Kappa Alphas as allies.</p></div>

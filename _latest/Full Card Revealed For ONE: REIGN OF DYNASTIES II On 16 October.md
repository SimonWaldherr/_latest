Full Card Revealed For ONE: REIGN OF DYNASTIES II On 16 October

After a successful return to Singapore with ONE: REIGN OF DYNASTIES on Friday, ONE Championship is getting ready to premiere the highly anticipated sequel.

This Friday, 16 October, the world’s largest martial arts organization will air ONE: REIGN OF DYNASTIES II, which was previously recorded in “The Lion City.”

Every matchup on the six-bout card features a top Chinese athlete hoping to inch his way closer to World Title contention.

In the main event, Japanese star Hiroki Akimoto will square off with former ONE World Title challenger “Muay Thai Boy” Zhang Chenglong in a ONE Super Series kickboxing bantamweight showdown.

Akimoto, a WFKO Karate World Champion who trains at Evolve in Singapore, brilliantly displayed his elite skills in the Circle during his debut 2019 campaign.

The Japanese striker recorded two victories, including a dominant win over ONE Strawweight Muay Thai World Title challenger Josh “Timebomb” Tonna.

Now, Akimoto is moving up a weight class and making his bantamweight debut against Zhang, who’s looking for some redemption.

After earning three consecutive victories, the Chinese athlete went toe-to-toe with Alaverdi “Babyface Killer” Ramazanov for the inaugural ONE Bantamweight Kickboxing World Championship in December. Though it was an extremely competitive affair, “Muay Thai Boy” fell on the wrong side of a unanimous decision.

Zhang is still ranked as the division’s #3 contender, but he’s eager to rejoin the World Title picture with a convincing win over Akimoto.

The ONE: REIGN OF DYNASTIES II co-main event features a Muay Thai World Champion versus Muay Thai World Champion battle, as Zhang’s older brother, “Bamboo Sword” Zhang Chunyu, faces Sagetdao “Deadly Star” Petpayathai in a ONE Super Series Muay Thai featherweight affair.

The Zhang siblings would love nothing more than to create a special memory and achieve victory together in Singapore.

However, this is also a special moment for “Deadly Star.” This fight will mark his first Muay Thai battle since retiring from the sport in 2014, and an impressive win could catapult him into ONE’s Athlete Rankings.

Also, the card will feature Malaysian sensation Keanu Subba, Chinese hero Han Zi Hao, the always-stylish Mohammed “Jordan Boy” Bin Mahmoud, and more.

Check below for the full lineup.

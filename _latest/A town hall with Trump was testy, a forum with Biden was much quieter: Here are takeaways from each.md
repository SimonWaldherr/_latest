A canceled presidential debate turned into a tale of of two very different town hall forums.

More than 1,000 miles apart on Thursday, President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden faced voters questions on everything from COVID-19 to race relations to health care.

But one was tense and testy. The other was conversational and intimate.

Here are five takeaways from the dueling televised appearances:

Guthrie grills, Stephanopoulos takes softer tack

In Miami, NBC moderator Savannah Guthrie grilled Trump for 18 minutes before opening the forum to audience members' questions. The president squirmed, chafed, and sarcastically called her "cute."

When Guthrie asked Trump if he had taken a COVID-19 test on the day of his debate with Biden, he dodged: "Possibly I did. Possibly I didn’t.”

When she asked if he had pneumonia during his COVID-19 illness, he said, "No, but they said the lungs are little bit different, a little bit – perhaps infected."

Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, ABC's George Stephanopoulos went straight to voters' questions and allowed the former vice president to give sometimes long-winded answers. Held in the National Constitution Center, with audience members seated safely distanced, the forum had the feel of an evening lecture hall on a college campus.

Biden is vague on court packing

Biden was asked Thursday if he supports expanding the Supreme Court as Republicans swiftly move to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s nominee to fill the seat vacated by the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

“I’m not a fan,” Biden said. “It depends how this turns out, not how (Trump) wins, but how it’s handled.”

Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, have repeatedly been asked whether they support expanding the court, but they have refused to give a clear answer. The Senate is expected to vote on Barrett’s confirmation later this month.

During the town hall, Biden said the Senate shouldn’t vote on the confirmation because early voting has already begun. More than 14 million Americans have early voted. When pressed about expanding the court, Biden said “No matter what I answer I gave you, that’s the headline tomorrow.”

“It won’t be about what’s going on now, the improper way they’re proceeding,” he continued.

Biden added he will make his position clear before Election Day on Nov. 3.

Trump on his debts: ‘$400 million is a peanut’

While discussing the issue of Trump’s taxes, he did not deny that he owes entities about $400 million, and pledged to tell Americans whom he owes money.

“I will not mind at all saying who it is,” Trump said. He said he doesn’t owe money to Russians, and said of whether he owes to any foreign interests, “Not that I know of.”

The New York Times reported that Trump has had low federal tax bills, just $750 for the years 2016 and 2017 and nothing for several other years, and taken major financial losses in his business career.

Trump has declined to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of tradition for presidential candidates. He cited an ongoing IRS review of his taxes as the reason, but there is no rule that prohibits him from doing so during an IRS investigation. He instead points to less detailed annual financial summaries required by law.

Trump was pressed during the town hall about a Times report that showed his real estate company suffered chronic losses. Trump said “the numbers are all wrong” in the report, but did not offer specific details about what was wrong.

“$400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world,” he said.

He further minimized the amount.

“What I’m saying is that it’s a tiny percentage of my net worth.”

“The amount of money – $400 million, is a peanut,” Trump said, arguing that his company is under leveraged.

Biden pressed on 'you ain't Black' comment

Cedric, a Black progressive voter from Harrisburg, Penn., pointedly asked how Biden would turn out young Black voters under 30, other than saying “you ain’t Black,” a reference to a previous comment Biden made. Cedric noted that he is part of a crucial voting bloc Democrats need to show up to the polls, adding that young Black voters aren’t going to vote for Trump but they are weighing whether to vote at all.

Biden gave a stem-winder response, saying he will give more funding to historically black colleges and universities, as well as to Title 1 schools. The former vice president also highlighted investing in Black entrepreneurs.

While Biden has the overwhelming support among Black Americans, younger voters have been more critical about supporting the former vice president.

During his answer, moderator George Stephanopoulos interjected, asking the voter whether he had heard enough to convince him to vote for the former vice president.

“I think so,” the voter replied.

“There's a lot more if you want to hang out afterward, I'll tell you more.” Biden said, before speaking about how he would combat red-lining practices that exclude Black Americans from home ownership.

Trump refuses to condemn conspiracy group QAnon

After Trump sparred with moderator Savannah Guthrie about his hesitancy to explicitly condemn white supremacy at the last debate, Guthrie asked him to condemn another group, which has been deemed dangerous by the FBI: QAnon.

Trump maintained he didn’t know much about the group, other than that they are “very much against pedophilia.”

“I’ll tell you what I do know about, I know about antifa and I know about the radical left,” he said.

Guthrie said to Trump that QAnon falsely alleges the existence of a satanic "deep state" apparatus that supports a child sex trafficking ring, but he said he couldn’t rely on her information to be factual.

“I just don’t know about QAnon,” Trump said.

“You do know,” Guthrie pressed.

“Why aren’t you asking me about antifa?” Trump pivoted, referring to the left-wing anti-fascist movement. “Why aren’t you asking Joe Biden questions about, why doesn’t he condemn antifa?”

Guthrie replied that she had Trump in front of her to ask questions, not Biden.

“Haha, so cute,” Trump responded.

On Tuesday, 143 coronavirus-related deaths were recorded, the highest figure for four months. Health officials described it as “hugely concerning”.

Mr Johnson was dealt another blow when the chairman of the UK vaccine task force said that a coronavirus vaccine was only likely to be 50 per cent effective, in line with flu deterrents.

Earlier, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, had said the concept of herd immunity from the virus was “emphatically false” as there could be no mass immunity “even if everyone caught it”.

Sir Keir’s intervention was seen as an indication that he believed the Prime Minister would ultimately be left with no choice but to impose a circuit breaker, and wanted to make it appear that he was following Labour’s lead.

He spoke moments before Mr Johnson faced his own MPs in a meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, and tried to divide the Tories by saying the Prime Minister could count on Labour votes for such a plan, implying that he may need to if his own party members rebelled against it.

Mr Johnson told the committee that Sir Keir was “careering all over the place like a broken shopping trolley” because he was calling for a national lockdown while some of his own front benchers were opposing local restrictions in their areas. Labour abstained last night when Parliament voted to approve the new three-tier system announced by Mr Johnson on Monday.

Mr Johnson is understood to have expressed concern that a circuit breaker would lead to the economy being switched on and off repeatedly.

One Tory MP said: “The circuit breaker option was raised and he just said, not in so many words, that the problem is that you are going to have a yo-yo-ing of the economy.

“You open up, you close down again, backwards and forwards.”

Despite Mr Johnson’s public stance on national lockdowns, government sources have privately conceded that a circuit breaker may become inevitable if the three-tier system fails to put infection rates into reverse.

<div><p>For one dad of three, getting dressed can be a real drag.</p>
<p>Mark Bryan, an American robotics engineer living in Germany, wears towering high heels and skirts every day to prove &#8220;clothes have no gender,&#8221; he told <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/confident-man-wears-heels-skirt-markbryan911/?utm_source=ladbible&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=organic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bored Panda</a>.</p>
<p>Bryan has shared his style shots on his now-viral <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CBkenlhKDVh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram, @MarkBryan911.</a> There, his bio explains further: &#8220;I am just a straight, happily married guy,&#8221; he wrote to his 62,000 followers, &#8220;that loves Porsche&#8217;s, beautiful women and incorporating high heels and skirts into my daily wardrobe.&#8221;</p>
<p>His daily wardrobe includes red pumps, plaid miniskirts, and seasonally appropriate suede boots, which Bryan paired with a sensible mid-calf beige pencil skirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer skirts to dresses,&#8221; Bryan, 61, said. &#8220;Dresses don&#8217;t allow me to mix the genders. I prefer a &#8216;masculine&#8217; look above the waist and a non-gendered look below the waist.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to footwear, Bryan, who also coaches football, prefers heels from the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CBkenlhKDVh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brand Lost Ink</a>. He has pairs of strappy stilettos and open-toed sandals from the company, because they &#8220;are great for men as they offer a wide fit in most of their shoes,&#8221; according to his Instagram.</p>
<p>Bryan insisted that his sartorial choices are for &#8220;non-sexual reasons.&#8221; The habit began in college with an old flame &#8212; the two would practice dancing together, both in high heels. Then it quickly became normal for him.</p>

 
	<p>He compared the experience of teetering around in public to having green hair. &#8220;You look up and see this person, your mind tells you it&#8217;s a person with green hair, you think to yourself, &#8216;that&#8217;s odd or interesting,&#8217; then you go back to do what you were doing and don&#8217;t give it another thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, his wife of 11 years helps him pick out clothes, and his daughter often wishes she could borrow his shoes.</p>
<p>At 6 feet tall without the heels, Bryan is quite the towering figure when he&#8217;s all gussied up. Even while working from home during the pandemic, when most former office-goers took the opportunity to dress down, Bryan wore business dress at his home desk.</p>
<p>His advice for men? &#8220;If you are asking about heels, then I would say to start with a low heel and work your way up as your confidence gets higher.&#8221;</p>

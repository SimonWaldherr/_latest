<div><p>Former President Barack Obama delivered an impassioned plea for his vice president and a scathing indictment of his successor at a Pennsylvania rally Wednesday, telling Philadelphians that a failure to come out strongly for Democrat Joe Biden would have repercussions for generations.</p><p>"We can't be complacent. I don't care about the polls. There were a whole bunch of polls last time. It didn't work out," Obama told a rally comprised of people sitting socially distanced inside their cars. "Because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home &#8211; and got lazy and complacent. Not this election. Not this time," Obama bellowed.</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on President Donald Trump</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4fb99c3/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fe0%2F2b%2Fd6d75bbe4cd8b6db026277148f17%2F20201020edphc-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>"Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies," including a plan to address the pandemic, while Trump "cannot even take the basic steps to protect himself," Obama said, then laid into Trump for reportedly referring to slain military members as "suckers and losers."</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>"Who does that?" Obama said. "With Joe and Kamala at the helm, you're not going to have to think about the crazy things they say every day. That's worth a lot," Obama said, referring to vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris of California. "You might be able to have Thanksgiving dinner without having an argument," Obama said, drawing approving honks of ralliers' horns.</p><p>Obama brought up Trump's retweet of a bizarre conspiracy theory that Biden had Navy SEALs killed to cover up the killing of an Osama bin Laden double.</p><p>"What?! WHAT?" Obama said, waving his hands in bafflement and disgust. "That's not normal presidential behavior," the former president said, referring to his successor as a "crazy uncle."</p><p>The events were the first time Obama campaigned in person for his former vice president, and the fact that Obama made Philadelphia his first stop was an indicator of how important the Keystone State is in deciding the next president.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>And almost four years out of office, Obama showed he could still wind up a crowd and generate an enthusiasm Biden tends not to draw from a campaign event. Obama marveled at the disclosure that Trump has a Chinese bank account &#8211; Fox News "would have called me 'Beijing Barry'" if he had done that, Obama said &#8211; and blasted Trump for his attention to Twitter over presidential leadership.</p><p>"This is not a reality show. This is reality, and the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously," Obama said.</p><p>Polls show Biden ahead in Pennsylvania - a <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/10/21/rel1a_pa.pdf">CNN poll </a>released Wednesday had the former vice president ahead, 53% to 43%, among likely voters. But the Biden campaign has warned that they think the race is much closer and has urged supporters not to get complacent.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Trump, too, is clearly worried about Pennsylvania, telling voters in a rally Tuesday night in Erie he only needed to come to Pennsylvania because of the pandemic.</p><p>"Before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn't coming to Erie. I mean, I have to be honest: There's no way I was coming. I didn't have to. I would have called you and said, `Hey, Erie, you know, if you have a chance, get out and vote.' We had this thing won," Trump told the ralliers.</p><p>Hillary Clinton narrowly lost Pennsylvania to Trump in 2016 in what was widely viewed as an upset. But the Democratic nominee's lead in polls at the <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html">same stage of the race</a> &#8211; 12 days before Election Day &#8211; was, on average, 4.3%, according to Real Clear Politics. </p><p>Obama, at the rally, pleaded with voters not to take any lead in the polls for granted and to deliver an unmistakable message that the state wants Trump out of office.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"I am asking you to remember what our country can be when your elected officials act responsibly," Obama said. "I'm asking you to believe in Joe's ability, in Kamala's ability to lead us out of these dark times</p><p>"We can't just imagine a better future. We've got to fight for it. We've got to vote like never before and leave no doubt about what this country stands for," Obama said.</p><p>At an earlier "Shop Talk" discussion with Black leaders in Philadelphia, Obama talked about the challenges of getting young people, especially young African Americans, out to vote and letting youth know the potential power they have.</p><p>"When I was 20 years old, I wasn't that woke ... because I had other stuff that I was interested in. We won't go into all the details," Obama said, drawing laughter.</p><p>"A lot of times, I think our young men &#8211; they may try to give a rationale for why they're not active and involved, but the truth is they're not active and involved because they're young and distracted," said the former president, who wore a mask during the entire time he was speaking.</p><p>Obama said he was "very proud" of his own barrier-breaking presidency, "but I didn't immediately solve systemic racism by virtue of me being president," he added. His administration was able to make things better, he said &#8211; not just by what was done at the very top but what was done through U.S. attorneys, not "throwing the book" at non-violent drug offenders.</p><p>"The answer for young people, when I talk to them, is not that voting makes everything perfect. It's that it makes everything better," Obama said.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Political post-mortems after Clinton's loss blamed lower turnout among Black voters as part of the reason for the outcome. Obama, who spurred record turnout among African Americans in 2008, reminded Black leaders of what could happen if they showed up in droves this year.</p><p>"It was still only 60%," Obama told the leaders at the "Shop Talk'' event. "We never tried (to see) what it would look like if we had 80% voting, or 90% voting. You don't know if it's going to work if you don't try it," he said.<br></p></div>

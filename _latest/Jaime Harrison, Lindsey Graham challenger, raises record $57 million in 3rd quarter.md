Harrison's haul is the highest quarterly amount raised by a Senate candidate in U.S. history, smashing former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke's record of $38 million when he ran in 2018.

"This campaign is making history because we're focused on restoring hope back to South Carolina," Harrison's spokesman Guy King said in a statement. "While Lindsey Graham continues playing political games in Washington, Jaime Harrison is remaining laser-focused on the real issues impacting people here, like healthcare, broadband access and COVID relief for businesses and families."

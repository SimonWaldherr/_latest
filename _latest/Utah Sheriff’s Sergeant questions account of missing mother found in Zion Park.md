  Utah Sheriff’s Sergeant questions account of missing mother found in Zion Park 
description: > 
  “If we had found somebody in that condition with that kind of severe head injury, we would have at minimum called for a transport agency to check her out,” he told ABC4.“The fact that that didn’t happen tells me that they did not find any significant injury to her that would’ve prompted them to do that.”

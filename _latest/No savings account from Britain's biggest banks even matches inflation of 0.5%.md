  No savings account from Britain's biggest banks even matches inflation of 0.5% 
description: > 
  All savers with Britain's biggest high street banks are losing money in real terms after their pitiful savings rates were outstripped by the latest inflation figure.But while 444 available savings accounts currently match or beat that rate, down from 661 last month, not a single one is offered by a major name, according to figures from Moneyfacts.And the best 'bread and butter' account available from a High Street savings provider pays just 0.25 per cent, or half the latest inflation reading from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday.Last month just 11 of the 661 inflation-matching savings accounts available on the market were offered by Britain's biggest banks, despite prices increasing at their slowest rate in four years.'In the current low interest rate environment we may see households having to increase their monthly savings contributions even more to offset smaller interest income in order to achieve their savings goals.'

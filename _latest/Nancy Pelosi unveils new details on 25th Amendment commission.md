WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday unveiled her plan to create a commission aimed at stripping President Trump of his presidential powers under the 25th Amendment.

“This legislation applies to future presidents but we are reminded of the necessity of action by the health of the current president,” Pelosi (D. Calif) said.

The bill would establish a Commission on Presidential Capacity to Discharge the Powers and Duties of Office that would “enable Congress to help ensure effective and uninterrupted leadership in the highest office in the Executive Branch of government.

Pelosi, who is second in line of succession for the presidency, insisted the commission was not about the commander-in-chief’s behavior.

The commission of 16 officials will be entirely bipartisan, co sponsor Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said, and would consist of Republicans, Democrats and even past presidents.

“Section 4 of Amendment 25 deals with a president who has become incapacitated but has made no provision to temporarily transfer powers,” Raskin said.

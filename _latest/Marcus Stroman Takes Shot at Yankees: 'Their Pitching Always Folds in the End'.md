  Marcus Stroman Takes Shot at Yankees: 'Their Pitching Always Folds in the End' 
description: > 
  Gary Landers/Associated PressMarcus Stroman either took one team out of the running ahead of his free agency Wednesday, or he made a not-so-subtle sales pitch.He isn't the first impending free agent who commented on the state of Yankees pitching.Stroman was a Yankees fan while growing up and, in 2014, spoke fondly about pitching at Yankee Stadium for the first time.It's tough to say whether Cashman saw Stroman's tweets since the latter doesn't have a verified account.Maybe Cashman can bring him in for a visit this offseason to get his forthright analysis in person.

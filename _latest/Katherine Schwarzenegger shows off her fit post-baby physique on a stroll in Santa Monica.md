Katherine Schwarzenegger looked incredibly svelte, as she displayed her impressive post-baby body on a stroll through Santa Monica on Saturday.

The Gift of Forgiveness podcast host, who shares her eight-week-old daughter Lyla with husband Chris Pratt, looked at ease during a solo coffee run.

As the best-selling author, 30, enjoyed her warm beverage in a light grey sweater and sporty legging as she dutifully wore a black CDC-recommended face mask and wireless headphones.

While strutting around in her Nike sneakers and coordinating work-out pants, she kept her lengthy honey-hued tresses swept into a messy bun.

During her outing, the USC grad shielded her eyes from any UV rays under a pair of retro tortoiseshell sunglasses.

Schwarzenegger competed her casual ensemble by toting her phone in a chic $105 green crocodile case, which allowed her to walk hands-free with its crossbody strap.

Last month an insider dished to Entertainment Tonight: 'Katherine, Chris and Lyla have settled in and have a good routine down. Both Chris and Katherine are busy with work but always make Lyla their priority.'

The source explained: 'Chris and Katherine have been overwhelmed with love and support from their family and friends. They are happier than ever and love how every day Lyla brings a smile to their face.'

Chris also shares an eight-year-old son called Jack with his first wife Anna Faris, whom he split from in 2017 with the divorce being finalized in 2018.

Schwarzenegger is reportedly in 'new mommy bliss mode,' a source told E! News in late September.

'She just reached the six week mark and is looking forward to getting out and doing more. She has been very cautious with COVID and the air quality in LA so has been staying in,' they explained to the outlet.

The insider also noted the parents have also reportedly 'had some help getting situated and helping the baby with sleep.'

But despite their helping hands, the source insisted that Katherine and Chris are 'very hands on' and that they 'are both home and with the baby, at almost, all times.'

'They have had some family visit for short periods of time but mostly have just been getting adjusted to their new little baby.'

Married: News of Katherine's pregnancy came just 10-months after her wedding to Chris, which took place in June of 2019; Chris and Katherine pictured in 2018

'We are beyond thrilled to announce the birth of our daughter, Lyla Maria Schwarzenegger Pratt,' Pratt said. 'We couldnâ€™t be happier.'

News of Katherine's pregnancy came just ten-months after her wedding to Chris, which took place in June of 2019.

He had proposed to Katherine in January of that year, less than a year after they began dating in June of 2018.

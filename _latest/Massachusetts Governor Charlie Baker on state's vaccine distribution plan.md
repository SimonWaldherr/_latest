<p>Officials anticipate limited supply in the early phase and plan to prioritize some health care workers, people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 &#8211; including people with underlying medical conditions and those older than 65 &#8211; and other essential workers, Baker said.</p><p>"The plan also outlines our messaging efforts to make sure people know once there is a vaccine available, that it has been approved by the federal government and is safe and effective," he said.</p>

<p>"We'll also make it a priority to reach out specifically to groups that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including people and communities of color."</p><p>Baker called it an interim plan "that will probably change as more information becomes available."</p><p>Massachusetts is among the states that has recently seen an uptick in COVID-19 cases. As of mid-last week, a total of 63 communities in the state, including Boston, were considered high risk for virus infections, up from 40 a week before. The designation is based on average daily cases per 100,000 residents, CBS Boston reported. High risk communities are those with over 8 cases per 100,000 residents during the last 14 days.</p> 
<p>"While we continue to plan for distribution of a vaccine, we can't take our eyes off the measures that we've been talking about for the last several months to keep people safe," Baker said Tuesday.</p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boston-mayor-marty-walsh-covid-19-update-watch-live-stream-today-2020-10-15/" target="_blank">Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said</a> late last week that officials are now giving "special attention" to gatherings and house parties "that are putting other people at risk," as the city sees a rise in coronavirus cases.&#160;</p><p>"We are tracing locations where house parties continue to happen," Walsh said, adding they are working with Boston's Inspectional Services department "to curtail these events." </p><p>Roughly half of new cases in the city continue to be in people who are under 30, said Walsh, who advised people to "get on Zoom" and socialize digitally.</p></div>

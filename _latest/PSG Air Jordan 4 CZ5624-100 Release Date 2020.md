First teased in early June, the PSG x Air Jordan 4 finally launches globally tomorrow, October 10th.

Although both organizations have collaborated before, tomorrow’s Air Jordan retro indulges in the least monochromatic arrangement yet. “Bordeaux” takes center-stage as it animates hardware, tongue and heel accents, and midsole tooling, while nodding to a beloved Jordan 7 arrangement. Nods to the storied Ligue 1 arrive in the form of “PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN” text on the rear, as well as “ICI C’EST PARIS,” the chant the club’s fans shout, on the sockliner. A tag on the forefoot rand also references Paris and its suburbs’ colloquial name (paname). (The light grey overlay also suggests more retros (“Military Blue”) using it are in the works.)

Enjoy another look at the collaborative Jordan 4 here below, and find an extensive store list ahead, too.

For more from NIKE, Inc., the original Nike Air Raid returns on October 15th.

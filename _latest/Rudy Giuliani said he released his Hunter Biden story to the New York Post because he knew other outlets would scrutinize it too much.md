  Rudy Giuliani said he released his Hunter Biden story to the New York Post because he knew other outlets would scrutinize it too much 
description: > 
  President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani told The New York Times on Sunday that he gave the New York Post a copy of a hard drive said to belong to Hunter Biden because other news outlets would have scrutinized it too much.Several of the Post's journalists voiced concerns about its reporting in interviews with The Times and New York magazine's Intelligencer, saying the sourcing was "flimsy" and didn't meet "journalistic standards."The Post last week detailed emails purportedly written by Hunter Biden and taken from a laptop left at a repair shop.They suggested that Joe Biden used his power as vice president to help his son curry favor with a Ukrainian energy company.He did say, however, that there was a "50/50" chance that one of his associates, a Ukrainian government official named Andrii Derkach, was a Russian spy.

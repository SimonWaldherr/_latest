Twitter did not take the tweet down, saying it was in the public interest for it to remain accessible.

This is the latest row to erupt between Mr Trump and Twitter. In May the company hid tweets written by Mr Trump, saying he had violated rules about glorifying violence. In the wake of rioting following the death of George Floyd, he tweeted “When the looting starts, the shooting starts."

Mr Trump had said he was "immune" from coronavirus as he prepared for a week of barnstorming around the country as the presidential election enters its final lap.

Just six days after being released from the Walter Reed Medical Centre, a bullish US president contrasted his health with that of Joe Biden.

“It looks like I'm immune for, I don't know, maybe a long time, maybe a short time. It could be a lifetime. Nobody really knows," he told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures.

"I passed the highest test, the highest standards, and I'm in great shape," he added.

On Saturday night White House physician, Sean Conley, gave Mr Trump a clean bill of health, saying the US president was "no longer considered a transmission risk to others."

Mr Trump held his first campaign event since being discharged from hospital on Saturday night, addressing a crowd from the balcony at the White House.

I was just so tired.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If I'm honest, I was really burnt out. I also wanted to have some freedom. I wanted to stay at home and learn how to cook properly and do what felt like healing things. Also, I went and got completely hammered for three years with Chris Evans.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David then asked her about her marriage to Chris, with Billie describing the relationship as 'very loving'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said: 'We had a really amazing time together, you know? I imagine it's what your uni years feel like. Sort of reckless, but you're learning a lot.&#160;</p><img id="i-e2c9f37bd98265a9" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="523" width="634" alt="History: The actress, 38, married the radio host, 54, in 2001 when she was 18 and he was 35, with the couple separating three years later before divorcing in 2007 (pictured in 2001)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-e2c9f37bd98265a9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/10/34609896-8858813-image-m-78_1603187951306.jpg" height="523" width="634" alt="History: The actress, 38, married the radio host, 54, in 2001 when she was 18 and he was 35, with the couple separating three years later before divorcing in 2007 (pictured in 2001)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">History: The actress, 38, married the radio host, 54, in 2001 when she was 18 and he was 35, with the couple separating three years later before divorcing in 2007 (pictured in 2001)&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was an incredible time and not to undermine our relationship because we also had a very loving relationship.

We had a very caring, loving relationship.'&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Billie added that Chris also gave her valuable advice on ignoring criticism, citing his words of wisdom to her when some doubted a former pop star was the right choice to be cast in sci-fi series Doctor Who, where she worked alongside David.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Billie said: 'I didn't pay much attention to it. He taught me how to not do that. And then, with Doctor Who, I had a sniff of it, but I didn't really know.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course, we didn't have smartphones, so you weren't constantly being reminded... So I just went for it. I wanted to prove myself as an actress. That was my goal.

Billie is also mother to daughter Tallulah, 21 months, with boyfriend Johnny Lloyd.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Elaborating further on the burn out she felt following her pop star days, which saw her reach the top of the charts at just 15 years old, Billie said whenever people would see a glamorous photo of her, she often felt miserable in them.</p><img id="i-a31e7a0aae08b7b" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="862" width="634" alt="Memories:&#160;Billie said she had an 'amazing time' with Chris and likened their relationship to being in university (pictured in 2001)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-a31e7a0aae08b7b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/10/34609904-8858813-image-m-79_1603187957414.jpg" height="862" width="634" alt="Memories:&#160;Billie said she had an 'amazing time' with Chris and likened their relationship to being in university (pictured in 2001)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Memories:&#160;Billie said she had an 'amazing time' with Chris and likened their relationship to being in university (pictured in 2001)&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said: 'Every time there'd be a picture of me looking completely groomed and manicured within an inch of my life, I can tell you I was completely unhappy and starving and dark on the inside. And I haven't brushed my hair since... I really have rejected that stuff.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Asked by David if she was able to 'take in' the level of success she was experiencing at such a young age, Billie admitted she has only come to terms with it recently.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said: 'I don't think you are. I've been talking about this more recently and I think I'm only just coming to terms with a lot of those things that happened to me in my teen pop star years.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think it's deeply unnatural to experience such highs at that age. I think it gives you a false sense of power. I think it's very confused and not something I'd want for my own kid.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Billie added that she does not have any regrets about her days as a pop star, saying: 'Not at all. None of it. I don't regret that time.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I can't regret that time, really. I don't think that would be very helpful... I wish I had done some things better and I wish other people had done some things better, but I don't sit there at night feeling really angry and regretful.'&#160;</p><img id="i-4fbc31efefe54b0b" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="893" width="634" alt="Honest: Recalling the burn out she felt as a pop star,&#160;Billie said whenever people would see a glamorous photo of her, she often felt miserable in them (pictured in 1999)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-4fbc31efefe54b0b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/11/34609890-8858813-image-m-95_1603188718532.jpg" height="893" width="634" alt="Honest: Recalling the burn out she felt as a pop star,&#160;Billie said whenever people would see a glamorous photo of her, she often felt miserable in them (pictured in 1999)" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Honest: Recalling the burn out she felt as a pop star,&#160;Billie said whenever people would see a glamorous photo of her, she often felt miserable in them (pictured in 1999)&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Billie and David discussed their time working on Doctor Who together where he played the lead role and Billie played his companion Rose Tyler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The actress said the buzz that surrounded the series was similar to how it felt at the height of her music career, remembering how crowds would show up to watch them filming&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said: 'I'd been there before and it's an uncomfortable position for me. I've never really liked that. You become this thing to people and you don't really have any part in that.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And so you have to behave a certain way or at least try to, and that's quite annoying. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it means that you can't be yourself entirely. And it means that you become incredibly guarded. And for me, reclusive, always.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David told his former co-star he thinks he 'survived' his increasing level of fame that came with the show thanks to Billie's help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'I've often said in the, in the intervening 15 years that entering into that madness... and particularly that loss of anonymity, which I had not really experienced before...&#160;</p><img id="i-f0470f347f6f1be0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="423" width="634" alt="Co-stars: David Tennant told Billie he believes he handled his increasing fame from Doctor Who better with he help" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f0470f347f6f1be0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/20/11/34610974-8858813-Co_stars_David_Tennant_told_Billie_he_believes_he_handled_his_in-a-12_1603191317533.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Co-stars: David Tennant told Billie he believes he handled his increasing fame from Doctor Who better with he help" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Co-stars: David Tennant told Billie he believes he handled his increasing fame from Doctor Who better with he help&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Because I had you to go on that journey with, I think I survived it much better than I might have done...

<div><p>Quibi, the well-funded short video app that billed itself as Hollywood's answer to TikTok and YouTube, is shutting down just seven months after launching to the public.</p>
<p>The company's chief executive Meg Whitman and founder Jeffrey Katzenberg confirmed on Wednesday that they had "exhausted every option available", with Mr Katzenberg admitting that its business strategy was "no longer viable".</p>
<p>The pair said that they would now wind down Quibi's operations, seek buyers for its assets and return money to its investors within the next few months. Subscribers will be told separately when their service will ens.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 and trading on Mr Katzenberg's stature as a former boss of Disney and Dreamworks,&#160;&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2020/05/22/will-quibi-expensive-flop-history/">Quibi's promise to give traditional TV and film studios an edge in the online streaming wars</a> attracted a mammoth $1.75bn (&#163;1.3bn) in funding.</p>
<p>It shelled out for more than 100 bite-size TV serials starring major names such as Laurence Fishburne, Anna Kendrick and Liam Hemsworth, sliced into five to ten minute episodes and specially formatted for smartphones.</p>
<p>Yet after launching this April to a lukewarm reception, the service struggled to lure subscribers away from rivals such as Netflix and Disney+ as the coronavirus pandemic both thinned consumers' wallets and drew them back to larger screens.</p>
<p>By Wednesday, Mr Katzenberg was forced to call Quibi's investors and tell them that the show was over,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quibi-weighs-shutting-down-as-problems-mount-11603301946"> according to the Wall Street Journal</a>, which first broke the news.</p>

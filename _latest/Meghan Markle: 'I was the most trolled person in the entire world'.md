"A lot of people don't know, that's like running a marathon,” said the Duchess. “So between every official engagement, I was running back to make sure our son was fed. That was a lot.

"But at the very end, the journalist asked me, ‘well are you ok’. I didn't realise my answer would receive such an interest from around the world.

"I didn't think about that answer, I just answered honestly. Because I was in a moment of vulnerability, because I was tired, because there was no presentation."

She continued: "Everyone asks about the baby and I think that’s par for the course and really sweet. [But] across the world, there was this ripple of 'yes ask me if I'm ok'.

“A year later, I would say yes I am doing well and the past few months have been layered for everyone. We certainly can’t complain, we are fortunate.”

Asked how she coped with challenges in her life, she said: “For me, journaling is a really powerful thing.

"It allows me to reflect on where I've come from and with that comes a lot of perspective.

"Most of us can connect to the idea that sometimes when you're going through something it feels like the biggest thing in the entire world.

“And then you look back at it a year and yeah it was still big...but it wasn't that big, comparatively."

The Duke said he made a choice not to read any negativity, adding that “meditation is key".

“I never thought I'd be the person to do that. The importance of creating the time in your day to take a breath and focus on the things that really matter, that builds up a certain amount of resilience.”

Speaking of online consumption, he likened the “nutritional value” of food labels to the digital world, urging people to make judgments about what was mentally healthy for them to spend time on. Now, he said, he makes sure to check in with friends to ask them how they are, and urged young people to know that speaking about their vulnerabilities is "a strength".

"We all know what it feels like to have our feelings hurt," said the Duchess. "We all know what it feels like to be isolated or othered. "You're not alone in all of it, we're all figuring it out."

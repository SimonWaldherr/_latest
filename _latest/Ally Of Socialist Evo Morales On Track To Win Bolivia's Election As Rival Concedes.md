<p>Socialists in Bolivia are celebrating a historic victory after a candidate handpicked by their ousted leader Evo Morales was on course to win the country's most important presidential election in a generation.</p>   <p>Luis Arce &#8212; a former economy minister during the Morales era &#8212; is poised to be officially confirmed as winner after his main rival conceded even before the official count from Sunday's election was complete.</p>   <p>Hours earlier, Morales, who is in exile in Argentina, announced what he called "an unprecedented historic triumph" and proclaimed, "We recovered our democracy."</p>   <p>The election followed the resignation last year of Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, after nearly 14 years in office. He left under pressure from Bolivia's military, after seeking a fourth term in an election that was later annulled following allegations of fraud. </p>   <p>A report by the Organization of American States raising questions about the results fueled mass anti-government protests. Morales and his supporters maintain he was the victim of a right-wing coup.</p>   <p>His departure, in November, laid the ground for Sunday's election, which was held despite the coronavirus pandemic and amid concerns that Bolivia's deeply polarized political scene could erupt into violence. </p>

   <p>Bolivians stocked up on food and other supplies ahead of the ballot. However, reports said that despite long lines at voting stations, the election went relatively smoothly.</p>   <p>In the runup to the vote, most polls gave Arce a significant lead, although analysts said he would likely fall short of the numbers needed to avoid a second round next month against his main rival, Carlos Mesa.</p>   <p>Conceding defeat at a news conference Monday, Mesa said initial counts showed a "strong and clear" win for Arce. "It is up to us, those of us who believe in democracy, to recognize that there has been a winner in this election," Mesa said. </p>   <p>The socialists' victory celebrations began earlier, when the country's unelected interim president, Jeanine &#193;&#241;ez, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeanineAnez/status/1318048552191483904">tweeted congratulations</a> to Arce on his apparent victory, while acknowledging the official count was not complete. &#193;&#241;ez, a right-wing arch-enemy of Morales, controversially took power after his departure.</p>   <p>"I congratulate the winners and I ask them to govern with Bolivia and democracy in mind," she said. Arce said he would seek to form a government of national unity and appealed for calm. </p>   <p>The British-educated Arce, 57, served two terms as Bolivia's economy minister. He presided over a nationalization program and commodities boom that helped provide funds to lift millions of Indigenous Bolivians out of poverty and delivered a period of sustained growth. </p>   <p>Mesa, 67, is a celebrated journalist and historian who served briefly as Bolivia's president from 2003 to 2005, and is widely considered a pragmatic centrist.</p>   <p>A victory for Arce and the socialist party will be seen as a triumph for the Latin American left and for Morales, who is considered one of its heavyweights. However, the next president faces profound challenges.</p>   <p>As in most of Latin America, COVID-19 has caused havoc within the health system and inflicted severe damage on the economy; the <a href="http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/538491588787962322/Global-Economic-Prospects-June-2020-Analysis-LAC.pdf">World Bank has forecast</a> a drop in Bolivia's gross domestic product of at least 5.9% this year. With more than 8,400 deaths (and more than 139,000 confirmed cases), its 11.7 million population has one of the world's highest recorded <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">per capita mortality</a> rates.</p>   <p>"Arce seems to have tapped most of the undecided vote," said Rodrigo Riaza, Bolivia analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. "The pandemic and the recession have taken a toll on people's trust in the alternative to the MAS," he said, referring to the Movimiento al Socialismo party. </p>   <p>"The key questions now is if the MAS will have an absolute majority in Congress," said Riaza. "Without it, Arce's ability to govern will be severely impaired."</p>   <p>Votes are still being counted from the congressional races, which were also on the ballot on Sunday.</p>

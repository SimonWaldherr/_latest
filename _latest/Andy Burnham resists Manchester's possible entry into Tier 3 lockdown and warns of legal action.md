  Andy Burnham resists Manchester's possible entry into Tier 3 lockdown and warns of legal action 
description: > 
  Asked whether legal action against the Government would be considered, Mr Burnham said: "We are law-abiding people, we would respect the law of the land.But we would consider other routes, legal routes, where we could protect our many thousands of residents who are going to be left in severe hardship in the run-up to Christmas."We would not just leave them in the lurch – we would try and support them, and that would include any legal action we could take on their behalf."He said he thought a national circuit-breaker lockdown would be a "better and fairer way" of tackling the Covid pandemic."When I say substantial support, I'm talking about an 80 per cent furlough guarantee across all of the sectors that would be required to close."

Asked whether legal action against the Government would be considered, Mr Burnham said: "We are law-abiding people, we would respect the law of the land. But we would consider other routes, legal routes, where we could protect our many thousands of residents who are going to be left in severe hardship in the run-up to Christmas.

"We would not just leave them in the lurch – we would try and support them, and that would include any legal action we could take on their behalf."

He said he thought a national circuit-breaker lockdown would be a "better and fairer way" of tackling the Covid pandemic.

The Labour mayor said accepting a Tier 3 proposal without a financial package that included an 80 per cent furlough scheme would be to "commit an act of self-harm" and would "level down" the region's economy, adding: "We will not let them be levelled down by this Government through this pandemic.

"When I say substantial support, I'm talking about an 80 per cent furlough guarantee across all of the sectors that would be required to close."

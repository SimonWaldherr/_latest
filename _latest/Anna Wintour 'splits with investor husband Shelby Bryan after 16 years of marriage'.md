There are a lot of rumours about me and probably about Anna Wintour&#8217;.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The separation sets up the prospect of a multi-million dollar divorce, with Wintour boasting an estimated net worth of&#160;$35million alongside her husband's sizeable fortune.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple split their time between a $11.4m townhouse in Manhattan's trendy Greenwich Village and a sprawling holiday home in the Hamptons, which features a tennis court and stunning landscaped grounds leading down to the waterfront.&#160;</p><img id="i-91c331befef2bb44" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="648" width="634" alt="Anna Wintour and her husband Shelby Bryan have split after 16 years of marriage, according to a Wednesday report running in Page Six.

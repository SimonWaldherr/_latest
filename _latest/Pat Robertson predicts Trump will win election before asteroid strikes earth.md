<div><p>Televangelist Pat Robertson predicted on Tuesday that President Trump will win the election, followed by mass civil unrest and then a potentially world-ending asteroid strike.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, I want to say without question, Trump is going to win the election,&#8217;&#8217; Robertson, the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network said on &#8220;The 700 Club,&#8221; <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/20/televangelist-pat-robertson-predicts-trump-win-end-world/5996435002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today reported</a>.</p>
<p>After the election, however, the 90-year-old preacher predicted global chaos, including a war against Israel, before a period of peace when God intervenes.</p>
<p>&#8220;God is going to bring a period of great peace,&#8217;&#8217; Robertson said.</p>
<p>But then, Robertson said, more than five years after the election, the world as we know it may come to end.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I think very frankly is the only thing that will fulfill the word of Jesus &#8230; is some kind of asteroid strike on the globe,&#8217;&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sudden destruction. It&#8217;s not going to be some nuclear war. We&#8217;re not going to be allowed to blow this earth up.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>Robertson has twice before incorrectly predicted the world&#8217;s end, the report said.</p>

<div><p>ABU DHABI &#8211; <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/walt-harris">Walt Harris</a>&#8217; last loss was tough on him emotionally, not only because of the outcome but the circumstances.</p>
<p>In May, when he returned from a brief MMA hiatus while still mourning the death of his stepdaughter Aniah Blanchard, Harris (23-8 MMA, 6-7 UFC) lost to Alistair Overeem by strikes in Round 2. Through the experience, Harris learned positive lessons about humanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned a lot about myself,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;I learned that there&#8217;s still good in the world with people. I heard a lot of great responses from that fight. Specifically, people (reached) out to me saying how grateful and thankful they were for me even getting in there &#8211; how much it inspired them to keep pushing through all the things that they&#8217;re going through &#8211; especially with the world being the way it is right now with this pandemic. That really touched me. It really picked me back up. I got back in the gym literally like two weeks later. I was right back on the horse.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Approximately five months later, Harris will return to action when he takes on Alexander Volkov (31-8 MMA, 5-2 UFC) on Saturday at UFC 254. The fight takes place on the pay-per-view main card and is one Harris sees as a potential stepping stone toward the upper echelon of the division.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfect,&#8221; Harris said of the matchup. &#8220;It&#8217;s still a big name. That was another blessing in the loss to Alistair. I was kind of concerned about my standing. I was like, &#8216;Man, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen now. I&#8217;ve worked so hard to get here.&#8217; Literally, this fight puts me right back where I was. When I beat him, I&#8217;m still in the mix, and I&#8217;m still pushing toward that title.&#8221;</p>
<p>UFC 254 takes place Saturday at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas. The main card streams on pay-per-view after prelims on ESPN 2/ESPN+.</p>

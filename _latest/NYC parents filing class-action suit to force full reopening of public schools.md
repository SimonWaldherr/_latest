<div><p>Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A group of fed-up city parents is suing the city to force the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/about-15-percent-of-nyc-parents-have-consented-kids-to-covid-19-tests/">full reopening</a> of the nation&#8217;s largest school system.</p>
<p>Organized by City Councilman Joe Borelli of Staten Island, the families are stressing the damage being wrought by screen-dependent remote learning in making their demand.</p>
<p>Some parents were scheduled to rally in front of a Staten Island courthouse Wednesday to draw <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/13/nyc-parents-still-in-the-dark-on-key-schooling-issues/">attention to their cause</a>.</p>
<p>The group will be &#8220;announcing the filing of a class action lawsuit against the New York City Department of Education seeking an injunction to ending remote learning and bring children back into the classroom,&#8221; according to a press release from Borelli&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>The councilman has recently questioned if remote learning satisfies state laws that guarantee public school students a basic education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have large cities opening, there are models in Dallas and Miami,&#8221; he tweeted in advance of Wednesday&#8217;s event. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have to settle the best Chancellor [Richard] Carranza and Mayor [Bill] de Blasio can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Borelli said the suit will be filed later Wednesday.</p>
<p>De Blasio partially reopened city schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/06/frustrated-parents-balking-at-does-coronavirus-testing-approach/">with a model</a> that has students alternate between home and classroom learning.</p>

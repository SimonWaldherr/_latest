Business owners in Liverpool are calling for clarity and detail from the prime minister, as some will be forced to close under new coronavirus measures.

Smithdown Road in Wavertree, Liverpool, has an eclectic mix of businesses, bars and cafes.

Adele Allan is fully masked up with a visor and PPE, busy working in her barbershop.

The idea of the city being put under further coronavirus restrictions, as part of a new three-tier system for England, has "got me really worried", she says.

"Even if we aren’t shut down, people are frightened and worried about coming to get their hair cut. There’s total confusion," she says.

A few doors away, Niall Scott is a bar manager at TriBeCa. It’s a bar and pizzeria so he isn't sure if it'll be allowed to stay open.

"Monday is a big day for us because we’re planning ahead for the week, ordering thousands of pounds' worth of food and drink. We need guidance on if we are going to be open or not," he says.

A few miles away, Connor O’Brien, who owns a firm operating gyms in the city centre, says the impact of forced closures on the area's fitness businesses would be "catastrophic" and "heartbreaking".

He says no coronavirus cases have been traced back to his gyms since they reopened following lockdown, and that the science and data "does not justify this closure" - adding that gyms are "vital" to people’s mental health and overall well-being.

Half-term holidays hang in the balance with the Prime Minister to consider a “circuit breaker” lockdown if his three-tier system fails to slow the spread of the virus.

Pubs, restaurants and other businesses could be forced to close under such measures with a decision to be made towards the end of next week. State schools' half-term break begins on October 26 and could be the start of such restrictions.

Regional ‘circuit breakers’ are under consideration; parts of the country are already facing limitations as the three-tier restrictions came into effect today – in those places under the highest tier, travel in and out of those areas in restricted, with the exception of school or work.

Northern Ireland is to bring in a partial “circuit breaker” with schools there to close for two weeks from Monday and closure of the hospitality sector apart from deliveries and takeaways.

Meanwhile, tourism authority Visit Wales told Telegraph Travel on Tuesday: “The First Minister of Wales is calling for travel restrictions to be put in place to ensure coronavirus cannot travel from areas where there are high levels of infection in the UK to areas where there are low levels of the virus in the UK."

Families' half-term holiday options are already limited with just four countries that Britons can visit without restrictions - those who had booked a UK break are now facing further uncertainty.

<div><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/switzerland/">Switzerland</a> will make face masks compulsory in indoor public spaces and ban gatherings of more than 15 people from Monday&#160;amid growing concern over a spike in coronavirus cases.&#160;</p>
<p>The Alpine country of 8.5 million people was <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/09/04/has-switzerland-handled-crisis-better-almost-anyone-else-europe/">largely spared</a> during the early stages of the pandemic, but Covid-19 has spread faster in Switzerland than in any other European country over the past week.&#160;</p>
<p>President Simonetta Sommaruga said the spread of the virus was &#8220;exponential&#8221; as she announced Switzerland&#8217;s first national restrictions and urged people to work from home. Previously measures to contain the crisis had been been left to local leaders in the country&#8217;s 26 cantons, or states.</p>
<p>Restaurants and bars may remain open provided they serve seated customers only.</p>
<p>A government statement said: &#8220;The sharp increase in the number of contaminations in recent days is worrying... It concerns all age groups and all cantons.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not obligatory to wear masks in schools and scheduled official events such as political rallies and sports events are exempt from the ban on gatherings, provided protection measures are enforced.</p>
<p>However, some cantons are imposing additional local restrictions on sports events. In Bern, a maximum of 1,000 spectators are now allowed.&#160;</p>
<p>In a sign of opposition to the new rules, several hundred protesters demonstrated on Sunday outside the Federal Palace, which houses the parliament and government.</p>
<p>Alain Berset, the health minister, urged people to be responsible and show common sense. &#8220;The second wave is here, earlier and stronger than we thought, but we&#8217;re ready for it. We know how to act and it is now time for all of us to make use of what we learned in the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Switzerland reported 3,105 new infections on Friday, compared with 1,487 a week earlier. It has had 1,822 deaths.&#160;</p>

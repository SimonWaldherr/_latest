Wichita State has launched an investigation into allegations of misconduct against head coach Gregg Marshall, according to a report published by The Athletic on Thursday night.

The investigation follows a turbulent season in which six scholarship players and a walk-on transferred from the program. A recruit who had committed to Wichita State also asked out of his letter of intent, and at least one player reportedly expressed concerns about Marshall’s behavior to the school before he transferred.

Former players Shaq Morris and guard Ty Taylor went on the record in a separate report by Stadium that detailed similar shocking allegations.

“He’s a maniac, a bully,” a former assistant told Stadium. “He disrespects people, brings up personal stuff, family, girlfriends.”

The reports include several explosive details, including an allegation that Marshall shoved and punched Morris during a practice in the 2015-16 season.

The alleged incident occurred during an October 2015 practice after Morris’ block attempt on teammate, Zach Brown, ended with Brown in pain after landing awkwardly.

“I went over to help (Brown) up, and as I was helping him up to make sure he was okay, bam — I’m struck on the left side of my face with a punch,” Morris told the website.

“I turned back with my fists ready to punch or swing. I don’t know who did what and I see Marshall standing there. I turned around and started walking out.”

The alleged punch came hours after Morris had told Marshall that his mom had cancer.

“Shaq walks away and Marshall punches him in the back of the head,” a former player said. “I’m in disbelief. He’s done flagrant stuff, but that was probably the reason I (transferred). I lost respect for him as a man. The worst part is that Shaq had told Marshall earlier that day that his mom had cancer.”

Morris confirmed the chain of events and told the website his mother passed away in July 2019.

Marshall also is alleged to have placed his hands around a staff member’s neck during that same season, and he allegedly berated a student-athlete from another sport and attempted to punch him through the driver’s side window of his vehicle because the student had parked in the coach’s spot.

“It wasn’t just players — the academic people, the marketing, everybody. If you had to associate with Wichita State basketball, you got caught in the crossfire,” one former player said to The Athletic. “I lost respect for him because I saw the way he treated my teammates and other people.”

Marshall declined to address specific allegations but sent a brief text message to The Athletic.

“I’m aware the university conducted interviews and I fully participated in the process,” he said. “I look forward to having it wrapped up as I continue to focus my energy on our team.”

The 57-year-old Marshall is entering his 14th season at Wichita State. He is 525-204 overall and 331-121 with the Shockers, whom he led to the NCAA Final Four during the 2012-13 season.

Marshall is under contract, at $3.5 million per year, through the 2021-22 season. His teams have averaged 27.4 wins per season since 2013-14.

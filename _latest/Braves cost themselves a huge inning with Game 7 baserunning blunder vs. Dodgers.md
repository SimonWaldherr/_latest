description: > 
  Nick Markakis hit a ground ball to the left side and the runner on third, Dansby Swanson, broke for the plate on contact.Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner fielded the grounder and quickly threw home to catch Swanson in a rundown.After getting a throw back from catcher Will Smith, Turner chased after Swanson and dove to apply a tag on his leg.Meanwhile the man on second, Austin Riley, had retreated once the rundown began but broke back towards third while Swanson tried going home.Turner popped up, turned around and quickly threw to shortstop Corey Seager covering third to put the tag on Riley.

 <p>     </p> <p> The Liverpool city region is currently the only part of England under Tier 3 - the strictest - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus-1">coronavirus</a> control measures. </p> <p>Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has said local leaders have "unanimously rejected" taking the city into a Tier 3 lockdown.</p> <p>He added the measures proposed for the city went "way beyond" the closure of pubs.</p> <p>But what do the tiers actually mean and what can people do, depending on which your local area is now in.</p> <p>Here Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in infection modelling from Warwick University, answers your questions.</p>

 <p>     </p> <p><strong>Can my child play with a friend at home after school?</strong></p> <p>Not in a Tier 3 area, says Dr Tildesley. &#8220;They can in Tier 1, but only if that means there are no more than six people in the house.</p> <p>&#8220;In Tier 2, they can play outdoors in the garden but not indoors. But Tier 3 rules prohibit mixing of households both inside and out.&#8221;</p> <p>Some parents may point out that their child has just spent the day with his friend and dozens of others in school. &#8220;It&#8217;s a balance of risk against benefits,&#8221; says Dr Tildelsey.</p> <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to make sure children remain in education, and the benefits of that outweigh the risks.&#8221;</p>

 <p>     </p> <p><strong>If there&#8217;s a circuit breaker lockdown will I still be able to go to McDonalds?</strong></p> <p>It depends on how severe any new lockdown might be, says Dr Tildesley.</p> <p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s going to be equivalent to Tier 3 rules, then restaurants could stay open. But if they decide to implement the same restrictions as the last lockdown, then all restaurants, including McDonalds, will close.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>I&#8217;ve booked a staycation for the half-term. If there&#8217;s a circuit breaker lockdown will I still be able to go?</strong></p> <p>Probably not. Dr Tildesley says: &#8220;If the model the Government follows is the same as the national lockdown in March you wouldn&#8217;t be able to go. But you won&#8217;t if it&#8217;s based on the rules of Tier 3 either, which advises against all non-essential travel.&#8221;</p> <p>He added that there is doubt whether there is time to bring in a circuit breaker lockdown by the half-term holidays.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t a circuit breaker just kicking the can down the road? What&#8217;s the point?</strong></p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an exit strategy, but it allows you to reset,&#8221; says Dr Tildesley.</p> <p>&#8220;If we can get the R below one, we&#8217;ll reduce the infection rate to levels of about five or six weeks ago. It buys you time to get test and trace capacity working, and further down the road, until a vaccine becomes available.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>If university students do have to isolate for two weeks before Christmas, won&#8217;t it just start spreading again once they go back in January?</strong></p> <p>&#8220;Isolating students is so they don&#8217;t go back to their home towns and potentially pass the infection on to the more vulnerable,&#8221; says Dr Tildesley.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible that infections may start again in January, but it&#8217;s also possible that a significant proportion of students have already been exposed to the virus, and we&#8217;ll see fewer infections in the new year.&#8221;</p>

 <p>     </p> <p><strong>Why do gyms have to shut in Tier 3?</strong></p> <p>Dr Tildesley says it isn&#8217;t compulsory for gyms to shut under Tier 3 rules, but left to local leaders to decide.</p> <p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re trying to minimise the spread of the virus in areas where we might expect people to mix, and gyms are a number of venues we think might be higher risk.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Can my kids still go trick or treating? And what about Bonfire Night?</strong></p> <p>It&#8217;s clearly not advisable to go knocking on doors during the pandemic.</p> <p> Dr Tildesley says: &#8220;This is a really difficult one. It&#8217;s important that we find a way to do these events that are so important to our children. We need to come up with a form of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> that doesn&#8217;t bring us into contact with people we wouldn&#8217;t normally see. </p> <p>&#8220;For Bonfire Night, there won&#8217;t be any big public fireworks displays this year, but you can still do one in your garden, as long as you adhere to the local rules.&#8221;</p>

 <p><strong>What&#8217;s going to happen at Christmas?</strong></p> <p>Decision-makers need to realise how important Christmas is, says Dr Tildesley.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s when families come together. We know that loneliness is a problem at Christmas anyway, and with the Tier 3 rules there are going to be an awful lot of people who are going to be by themselves this Christmas, unless we do something about it.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see us make enough progress in the next few weeks that we might have a slight relaxation on the rules over Christmas, such as extending the rule of six to 10, regardless of tier. It&#8217;s another argument for a circuit breaker so we can get on top of it.&#8221;</p> <p> I <strong>f my area becomes Tier 3, am I still able to travel outside of it for work?</strong></p> <p>&#8220;Under Tier 3 rules you must avoid all non-essential travel,&#8221; says Dr Tildesley.</p> <p>&#8220;If the purpose of that work trip can&#8217;t be achieved from home, then it would be regarded as essential travel.&#8221;</p>

 <p><strong>I&#8217;m in a Tier 3 area and I&#8217;ve got a holiday booked abroad. Can I still go?</strong></p> <p>The rules don&#8217;t explicitly ban travel abroad, says Dr Tildesley.</p> <p>&#8220;But the quarantine advice is still in place, which means you may need to quarantine in the country you&#8217;re going to, as well as 14 days when you get back.</p> <p>"In a Tier 3 area you are advised not to leave the area, but Government guidance doesn&#8217;t say whether it&#8217;s illegal and it&#8217;s unclear what the penalties are if you do.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Will I get a refund if the rules in my area prevent me from going to the hotel I booked?</strong></p> <p>Look at the booking policy and contact the hotel.</p> <p>&#8220;A lot of hospitality venues have been extremely understanding, but it is down to them and the policy at the time of booking as to whether they give you a refund.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>What are the rules on moving house/flat and changing households?</strong></p> <p>You are still allowed to move house, view, rent and buy properties, even in a Tier 3 area.</p> <p>Dr Tildesley says: &#8220;For people moving in with new flatmates that would move them into a new household situation, so if they&#8217;re moving out of their parents&#8217; house, for example, that might mean they won&#8217;t be able to visit their parents.&#8221;</p> 



<p class="spacer"></p>

 <p><strong>My boyfriend lives with flatmates. Will I still be able to see him?</strong></p> <p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re in Tier 1, you will be able to see him provided that, with you, there are no more than six people in that house. In Tier 2, you can see him outdoors, unless he and you are part of the same bubble. In Tier 3, you won&#8217;t be able to see him.&#8221;</p> <p>You might be able to see your boyfriend or girlfriend under an apparent loophole in the law, however - to have sex (see below).</p> <p><strong>Can you still have workmen in your home? Builders/plumbers etc?</strong></p> <p>Yes, says Dr Tildesley. &#8220;Just like during the first lockdown, the work of builders and plumbers counts as essential and will always be allowed.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>How come I need to wear a mask to the toilet but not when I&#8217;m sitting at the table?</strong></p> <p>Dr Tildesley explains: &#8220;When you&#8217;re at the table you should be sitting with people in your group.</p> <p>"When you get up from the table there is the possibility that you might interact with people you haven&#8217;t come to the pub with. So by wearing a mask you&#8217;re trying to minimise transmission.&#8221;</p>

 <p><strong>In Tier 2, I can go to the gym with others but not my friends? What happens if I bump into them at the gym?</strong></p> <p>&#8220;The point is that you can&#8217;t have an organised trip to the gym, because households can&#8217;t mix indoors,&#8221; says Dr Tildesley.</p> <p>Theoretically you could attend the same class with your friend, but you can&#8217;t go training in the gym with your friend. If you happen to bump into your friend in the gym then you should treat that the same as any other interaction with anyone else in the gym.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>I&#8217;m in Tier 2. Can I go and stay over at my mum&#8217;s in Tier 1?</strong></p> <p>&#8220;Unfortunately not, unless your mum is in your support bubble,&#8221; says Dr Tildesley. Someone who is the only adult in their home can form a support bubble with another household.</p> <p><strong>Can Tier 2 households holiday together in a Tier 1 area?</strong></p> <p>&#8220;No, because you are not allowed to mix between households, whether inside or outside your local area.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Can you travel to Scotland or Wales if you are coming from a Tier 3 location?</strong></p> <p>Leaders in Wales have said they will ban visitors from coronavirus hotspots in England if the Government doesn&#8217;t impose those restrictions by 6pm today (Friday). Scotland is also considering similar restrictions.</p>

 <p><strong>Why do pubs have to shut in Tier 3 areas but restaurants can stay open? What difference does serving food make?</strong></p> <p>Dr Tildesley says: &#8220;I assume that this is more of an economic decision, providing some level of protection to the hospitality sector.</p> <p>"It might also be that eating establishments are less likely to get the kind of drunken behaviour we&#8217;ve seen which has helped spread the virus.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>If we leave a Tier 2 area for a Tier 1 area, are we allowed to socialise indoors?</strong></p> <p>No, because the rules you must follow are those from where you live, not where you go to.</p> <p><strong>My mum&#8217;s in a care home in Tier 3. Will I be able to see her?</strong></p> <p>Tier 3 rules advise against visiting a care home except in exceptional circumstances, such as end of life. Dr Tildesley says: &#8220;What is allowed is very much down to the individual care home. Regardless of tier, access is very carefully managed. You should talk to the care home to find out what rules they&#8217;ve put in place.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>My sister&#8217;s wedding is in a Tier 2 area, and I&#8217;m in Tier 3. Will I be able to go?</strong></p> <p>Dr Tildesley says: &#8220;Very sadly, that&#8217;s a no, unless your sister is in your support bubble, which given it&#8217;s a wedding is probably unlikely.</p> <p>"As well as not being able to socialise outside their household, people in Tier 3 are advised against non-essential travel, and attending a wedding isn&#8217;t regarded as essential travel.&#8221;</p> <p>In Tier 3 areas wedding ceremonies are allowed but receptions aren&#8217;t allowed. In Tier 2 receptions are restricted to 15 people.</p> 



<p class="spacer"></p>
<img alt="You might still be able to have sex though">

 

 <p><strong>Can you have sex with someone who lives in a different house if you are in a relationship?</strong></p> <p>This is an anomaly which really needs clarification, says Dr Tildesley.</p> <p>&#8220;A recent change in the law allowed couples who are in committed relationships to have sex with their partner living in a different household, as long as it didn&#8217;t break the rule of 6. But under the new tier system it&#8217;s not clear if those rules have changed or not.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also not clear what this means, how long they can stay in the house and at what point the sex ends and they need to leave.</p> <p>"Under the rules, couples who are dating must do so in a socially-distanced way, forgoing even kissing, but when they want to have sex that allowed.&#8221;</p></div>

  Critics praise Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Borat 2' as 'fitfully funny' and 'urgently satirical' 
description: > 
  Movie critics seemed to have mostly positive feedback for the mockumentary, which has an 85% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes." 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' features an unexpectedly strong ending that at least pays off some of the sweeter aspects of the family dynamic, plus wraps up on an activist note," he wrote.Los Angeles Times critic Justin Chang lauded the mockumentary for its raunchy shenanigans, calling it "scattershot, fitfully funny and sometimes weirdly poignant.""Borat isn’t exactly woke, but his time has come: This searing brand of humor has never felt more essential."Having been made with a specific political purpose, Subsequent Moviefilm won’t age as well as the previous 'Borat' did," he wrote.

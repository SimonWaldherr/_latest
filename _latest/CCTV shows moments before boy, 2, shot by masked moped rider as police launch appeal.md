 <p>Lillian Serunkuma said: &#8220;This situation has had me perplexed by the actions of the person who did this and as much as I appeal to those who have any information I also understand their reluctance to say anything, however I urge them to do the right thing as this could have happened to anyone.</p> <p>She continued; &#8220;The perpetrator chose to do this to innocent victims, therefore this is not a person that should be free if anyone knows something. </p>

 <p>"I worry that someone with that mind-set is a risk to the community. This is something no family should have to deal with. The fact that an innocent child was also a victim, it&#8217;s important that people acknowledge this should never happen and any information however insignificant at the time may be important now.&#8221;</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Pete Wallis, Specialist Crime North, who is leading the investigation, said: &#8220;This was an appalling attack that left a little boy fighting for his life and, by sheer chance, did not end in a fatality. </p>

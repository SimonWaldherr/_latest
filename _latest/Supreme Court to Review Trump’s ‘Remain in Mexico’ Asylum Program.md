  Supreme Court to Review Trump’s ‘Remain in Mexico’ Asylum Program 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether the Trump administration could maintain a program that has forced at least 60,000 asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their requests are heard.An appeals court blocked the program in February, saying it was at odds with both federal law and international treaties and was causing “extreme and irreversible harm.” But the Supreme Court stayed that ruling in March while it considered whether to hear an appeal, leaving the program in place.The program applies to people who leave a third country and travel through Mexico to reach the United States border.In its brief seeking Supreme Court review, filed in April, the administration acknowledged that “the public health emergency caused by the Covid-19 virus” prompted it to take additional measures making it even harder to seek asylum.“The government’s response to the emergency is fluid,” the brief said, “and measures attributable to the emergency are not at issue in this case.”

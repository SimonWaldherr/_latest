The trailer for his directorial debut, completed well over a year ago, finally dropped last week.

And Josh Duhamel looked content and ruggedly handsome on Sunday, as he strolled alongside his beauty pageant winner girlfriend Audra Mari on the beach in Malibu, California.

Both Josh, 47, and Audra, 26, carried their footwear in hand during their romantic surfside walk, smiling coyly as they went.

The Transformers star wore a simple white tee that gave a hint of his built frame underneath.

He cuffed his chinos up to below his knee, so as not to get them wet.

Josh wore a dark trucker hat, and had an additional layer slung over his shoulder in the afternoon sun.

Audra, a native of Fargo, North Dakota, was dressed in a grey hoodie and white cutoff shorts.

The raven-haired beauty queen had a black purse with gild chain hanging from her shoulder, carrying her black heeled sandals as she walked barefoot in the sand.

Mari was crowned Miss World America in July of 2016, going on to represent the United States at the Miss World pageant that year.

She started dating Duhamel, also a native of North Dakota, in late 2019 – soon after his divorce to Fergie, nee Stacy Ann Ferguson, was finalized.

Josh, meanwhile, is star, co-writer and first-time director of the comedy Buddy Games.

What's more, he also produces the outlandish comedy, with the first trailer having arrived earlier this month via Saban Films.

The film follows Duhamel's character Bobfather as he assembles his best friends for a series of crazy and daring competitions, with the winner taking home $150,000.

The zany caper also stars Olivia Munn, Dax Shepard and Kevin Dillon.

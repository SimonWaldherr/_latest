  Lindsey Graham wants a COVID bill but slams Pelosi for trying to 'change election laws' 
description: > 
  I disagree,' Graham told 'Full Court Press' host Greta Van Susteren in a Sunday morning interview when speaking of those who don't want another relief package in general.On Saturday evening, Pelosi gave the White House a 48-hour deadline to resolve the contentious COVID-19 relief negotiations, which have become increasingly rooted in partisanship.Hammill then called on the White House to prove its commitment to reaching an agreement on the relief aid.Most recently, the White House unveiled a $1.88 trillion proposal that came just one week after House Democrats passed the $2.2 trillion relief bill this month.Trump also said he was willing to spend more than the $1.88trillion White House package, but that would likely be a hard sell to some Republicans.

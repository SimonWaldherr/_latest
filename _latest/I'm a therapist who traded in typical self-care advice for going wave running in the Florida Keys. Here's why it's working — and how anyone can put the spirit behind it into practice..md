  I'm a therapist who traded in typical self-care advice for going wave running in the Florida Keys. Here's why it's working — and how anyone can put the spirit behind it into practice.

<li>During the pandemic, Morin has been working from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-one-article-helped-me-quit-job-move-to-sailboat-2020-6">her sailboat home</a> with little social interaction or outside activities, which she says for some can be a recipe for depression.</li>
<li>Instead of going the traditional self-care route, she decided to step up her routine by scheduling time every day to take her WaveRunner out for a spin on the water.</li>
<li>Self-care doesn't all have to be aromatherapy or spa day-related, Morin says. An adrenaline-boosting activity can help clear your mind, and give you something to look forward to on a regular basis.</li>

<p>As an author, much of my time is spent staring at my laptop. I'm also a speaker, so in the pre-pandemic era, I spent a lot of time traveling to speaking engagements.</p><p>

</p><p>I love meeting new people, visiting fun places, and talking to new audiences about mental strength.</p><p>By mid-March, however, all of my business-related travel got canceled for the foreseeable future. So like many people, I found myself working from home all the time with no place to go.</p><p>I should mention that for me, home is a sailboat. And while the view is always great, it's not the most spacious place to work.</p>

<p>The living room is also the office&#8230; and the dining room. At the moment, it's also my podcast studio. I sit in the same spot whether I'm eating, watching TV, or working.</p><p>And while I can go outside to get a change of scenery in the middle of the day, the summer heat in South Florida drives me back into the air-conditioned boat pretty fast.</p><p>As a therapist, I know staring at the same walls day in and day out with little social interaction is a recipe for depression. So I stepped up my self-care routine.</p><h2><strong>I knew I didn't need the "traditional self-care" suggestions that are meant to help you unwind.</strong></h2><p>Meditation, journaling, or a bubble bath weren't going to cut it. I needed excitement &#8212; like an adrenaline rush.</p>

<p>I'm fortunate to have a WaveRunner and since I live on the water (literally), I can take it out whenever I want. But it's easy to let the days pass by without ever taking advantage of that.</p><p>So I decided to put "wave running" into my calendar. I scheduled it in, just like I would a business meeting, that at least two times a week, I'd take the WaveRunner out in the middle of the afternoon.</p><p>

</p><p>I chose the middle of the afternoon deliberately. Even though I've been self-employed and in charge of my own schedule for years, there's still something about taking an extended break on weekday afternoons that makes me feel like I'm "skipping school." And I like the feeling that I'm doing something slightly rebellious.&#160;</p><p>Riding a personal watercraft in the Florida Keys in the middle of a week day afternoon makes me feel alive &#8211; during a time when the news is trying to convince me that the world is falling apart.</p>

</strong></p><p>When I know the plan is to go for a ride in the afternoon, I get more done in the morning. I don't get distracted by social media or head down the rabbit hole of random media stories. I stay on task. After doing something fun, I'm more productive when I get back to work too. When I feel better, I do better.</p><p>It's slightly embarrassing to admit this felt like a revelation to me. It's something I've encouraged therapy clients to do for years. In the professional setting, we call it "pleasant activity scheduling."</p><p>That doesn't just mean do something fun when you feel like it.&#160;</p><h2><strong>The key to getting the most benefit means putting that enjoyable activity in your schedule.</strong></h2><p><strong>

</strong></p><p>Don't just do something fun when you feel like it, make it a priority in your routine. Not only does this increase the likelihood that you'll actually do it, but scheduling it also gives you something to look forward to.&#160;</p>

<p>And when you have something to look forward to, you get an instant boost in your mood. Then, when you do that fun activity, you'll get a second boost in your mood. Finally, after you've done that enjoyable thing, you get a third boost in your mood because you've created a positive memory.</p><p>It's easy to forget how something that seems so simple can have such a big impact. Scheduling something fun is tougher during the pandemic when you can't do a lot of the activities you might normally enjoy &#8212; like going to the movies or attending a concert.</p><p>And I know not everyone has a personal watercraft at their disposal. But, if you can find something fun to do on a regular basis, it can boost your mood and help you feel better.</p><h2><strong>Self-care doesn't have to involve putting cucumbers on your eyes or lighting scented candles.</strong></h2><p>Instead, self-care involves doing what's good for you in the long-term. And what's good for me right now just happens to involve skimming across the saltwater on a personal watercraft on a random weekday afternoon.&#160;</p>

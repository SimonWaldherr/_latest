<div><p>These chests were made for arrests.</p>
<p>In what could be one of the steamiest &#8212; and strangest &#8212; job recruitment videos ever, shirtless Egyptian Police Academy graduates were depicted last week in an over-the-top display of brawn and bravado.</p>
<p>The video, shared on Twitter by <a href="https://twitter.com/EgyProjects/status/1316783257556582404" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@EgyProjects</a>, depicted a bizarre parade of pickups, boats and armored vehicles all carrying the shirtless cops, who show off their best &#8220;Hulk smash!&#8221; poses and, in other scenes, performed some wild athletic feats in a Cairo stadium.</p>
<p>The ripped recruits were shown rolling huge tires, using sledgehammers to shatter cement blocks on their colleagues&#8217; firm abdomens, performing forward-rolls through hoops and pulling pickup trucks as fellow recruits do pushups in the back. (As one does.)</p>
 
<p>The audience, which Storyful reported included Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, also watched dudes zip-lining while wearing green overalls in a peculiar display straight out of a Cirque du Soleil show.</p>
<p>Twitter commenters called the display &#8220;cringe-worthy,&#8221; &#8220;hilarious&#8221; and &#8220;f&#8201;-&#8201;-&#8201;king amazing,&#8221; while some suggested the participants might be &#8220;overcompensating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others winked at the event&#8217;s homoerotic undertones. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably the most gay thing I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalMadjesty/status/1317554496663359488" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said one observer</a>, while others <a href="https://twitter.com/Fiddledock/status/1318129474341392390" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called it</a> &#8220;the gay circus&#8221; and an &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/Karrick46976979/status/1317475643034988545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outstanding LGBT parade</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The video, which was first posted Oct. 15, had been viewed more than 276,00 times by Monday morning.</p>
<p>This was definitely not Steve Guttenberg&#8217;s &#8220;Police Academy.&#8221;</p>

  Laptop allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden is linked to FBI 'White Collar' money laundering probe 
description: > 
  AdvertisementThe FBI's subpoena of Hunter Biden's alleged laptop and hard drive was linked to a money laundering investigation in late 2019, it has been revealed.However, it’s not clear if that investigation is ongoing or if it was directly related to Hunter Biden.On Wednesday the Biden campaign condemned the claims against Biden that were first reported by the New York Post last week.He said on CNN last week: 'We know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin.'Hunter Biden’s international business deals fell into the spotlight once again last week following the new report.

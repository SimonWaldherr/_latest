<div><p>Unearthing the most sought-after beauty products of the year is sure to reveal some interesting finds, but doing so at a time when life as we know it has completely transformed is an entirely different case.&#160; We are now spending more time at home, covering our faces and washing (just about everything) more than ever, and this of course, has seen a shift in our spending habits.&#160;</p>

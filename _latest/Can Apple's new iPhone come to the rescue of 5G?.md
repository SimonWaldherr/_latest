The last time an Apple phone ushered in a new era of mobile networks, the company drew little attention to the fact.

2012’s iPhone 5 was the first to support 4G connections, a leap forward that multiplied download speeds, made on-the-go video bingeing and web browsing possible, and helped create a series of mobile services like Uber and Spotify.

But when Apple unveiled the device, marketing chief Phil Schiller devoted just a few words to the upgrade, instead focusing on the phone’s new widescreen design, panoramic camera and the new Lightning port used to charge it.

By contrast, 5G is already at the centre of its sales pitch for the next iPhone, which Apple is due to announce on Tuesday evening. When the tech giant emailed invitations to the virtual event last week, they came with the tagline “Hi, Speed”, a reference to the blisteringly fast internet connections that the next generation of mobile networks promises.

Tuesday’s launch, held later than usual due to pandemic-related supply issues, is Apple’s most important event of the year. The iPhone makes up half of its revenues and remains the device that its supporting cast of products revolves around.

But the world’s biggest company is not the only one with a lot riding on the event. The world’s mobile operators have put billions into upgrading their networks to be ready for 5G, hoping to stoke consumer demand for connections 100 times faster than the previous generation.

That demand, however, has been lacking. More than a year after the UK’s first 5G network was switched on, the technology still seems like a solution looking for a problem.

“There’s just no definitive application that says ‘you need 5G for this’. You’re kind of throwing technology out there, but what are the use cases that justify it?” says Tuong Nguyen, an analyst at Gartner.

  Report: Michael Thomas Suffered Hamstring Injury in Saints Practice; Status TBD 
description: > 
  Tyler Kaufman/Associated PressNew Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas picked up a hamstring injury in practice, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.Pelissero reported the Saints have yet to make a decision on Thomas' status for Sunday's game against the Carolina Panthers.The 27-year-old already missed time earlier this season with an ankle injury and was also ruled out of a contest against the Los Angeles Chargers for disciplinary reasons.This is yet another setback in a season that hasn't gone to plan for arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL.There are few defensive backs in the league who can stop him, which makes New Orleans far more dangerous when he is on the field.

  Restaurants to accept business lunches through Covid loophole 
description: > 
  Some of the City's top restaurants are set to take advantage of a Covid loophole and restart bookings for business lunches despite a ban on household mixing in London.Firms including the Michelin-starred Galvin La Chapelle, The Wolseley and steakhouse chains Gaucho and M Restaurants have said they will accept business reservations with immediate effect due to an exemption written into the Government's guidelines.Swathes of other restaurants in London could now follow suit, along with those in other cities under so-called Tier 2 and Tier 3 regulations such as Liverpool and Manchester.People in Tier 2 or Tier 3 areas are banned from socialising with more than one household indoors, including in pubs and restaurants.Restaurants in central London - which was placed under Tier 2 restrictions last week - are heavily reliant on sales from business customers, who account for the vast majority of daytime trade from Monday to Friday.

<div><p>Some of the City's top restaurants are set to take advantage of a Covid loophole and restart bookings for business lunches despite a ban on household mixing in London.</p>
<p>Firms including the Michelin-starred Galvin La Chapelle, The Wolseley and steakhouse chains Gaucho and M Restaurants have said they will accept business reservations with immediate effect due to an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/working-lunches-pub-could-exempt-lockdown-restrictions/">exemption written into the Government's guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Swathes of other restaurants in London could now follow suit, along with those in other cities under so-called Tier 2 and Tier 3 regulations such as Liverpool and Manchester.</p>
<p>People in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/tier-2-lockdown-rules-high-alert-areas-restrictions/">Tier 2</a> or <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/tier-3-lockdown-rules-high-alert-areas-restrictions/">Tier 3</a> areas are banned from socialising with more than one household indoors, including in pubs and restaurants.</p>
<p>But this week Downing Street and local authorities suggested that such meetings are permitted so long as they are for "work purposes".</p>
<p>No10 has since stressed that the exemption is designed for freelancers or the self-employed who do not have an office to conduct face-to-face meetings.</p>
<p>However, it is understood that this is simply guidance and individuals who meet for a working lunch will not be liable for fines. &#160;</p>
<p>Restaurants in central London - which was placed under Tier 2 restrictions last week - are heavily reliant on sales from business customers, who account for the vast majority of daytime trade from Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>Operators said they had begun to see signs of office workers returning before the Prime Minister placed the capital on a &#8216;high&#8217; alert level last week, triggering the Tier 2 regime.&#160;</p>

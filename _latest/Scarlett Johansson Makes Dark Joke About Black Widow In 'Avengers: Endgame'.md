<p>The death of Black Widow drew <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/avengers-endgame-black-widow-death-scarlett-johansson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong reactions</a>, with some comparing it to the tired comic trope of &#8220;<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/2/18524155/avengers-endgame-failed-black-widow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fridging</a>,&#8221; in which a woman is killed as a plot device to move a male character&#8217;s story forward.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/avengers-endgame-questions_n_5d165532e4b07f6ca57cdafb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 interview</a>, writer Christopher Markus explained to HuffPost why Black Widow was ultimately chosen. &#8220;We had to take two people up there who love each other, and we know that Clint [Jeremy Renner] and Natasha [Johansson] have had a very long relationship that they would qualify, and then once we brought them up there, it became a question of who is at the end of their story because we wanted &#8212; when we were &#8216;killing people&#8217; or ending their run &#8212; we wanted to make sure that they had closure that there was an appropriateness to the death when it happened so that it would feel heroic and not tragic.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>Of course, Johansson&#8217;s character will return in her own post-mortem movie,&#160;&#8220;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-widow-delayed-coronavirus_n_5e710643c5b60fb69ddf2935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Widow</a>,&#8221; which has been repeatedly rescheduled because of the coronavirus and is now set to come out in 2021.

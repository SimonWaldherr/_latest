<p>The singer, 20, performed &#8220;This Is Us&#8221; with Jimmie Allen during Wednesday night&#8217;s show in a see-through bodysuit by <a href="https://www.saganyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Saga NYC</a> that featured a bedazzled bikini.</p>
<p>She accessorized the nearly-nude look with opera-length gloves and a cowboy hat, both by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/phalliccvnt/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phallic Cvnt</a>, along with thigh-high boots by <a href="https://jeffreycampbellshoes.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey Campbell</a> and <a href="https://chrishabanajewelry.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chrishabana</a> jewels.</p>
<p>Though many fans praised Cyrus&#8217; bold voice, others were divided over her skin-baring outfit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell is this!?? I guess Noah Cyrus forgot some clothes,&#8221; one person <a href="https://twitter.com/JoMama30146541/status/1319089845051002880?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>, while another <a href="https://twitter.com/courtneygirlx7/status/1319088759699312642?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, &#8220;Noah Cyrus, this is the country music awards. Put some clothes on.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/JessieeDi/status/1319091011193372673?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, &#8220;Seems Noah Cyrus didn&#8217;t get the memo that CMT Awards are not equivalent to the Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion show. I cannot fathom how incredibly distasteful &amp; abhorrent her &#8216;costume&#8217; was. Praying to God above that she&#8217;s forbidden to perform among CMT artists ever again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still others jumped to the star&#8217;s defense. &#8220;Everyone is heated about @noahcyrus outfit tonight but honestly I loved it and wish I had that kind of confidence,&#8221; one fan <a href="https://twitter.com/sunrisegrace/status/1319089652624723968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>Before hitting the stage in her jaw-dropping look, Cyrus <a href="https://pagesix.com/slideshow/cmt-awards-2020-red-carpet-all-the-best-dressed-celebrities/">took to the red carpet</a> in a knit crochet crop top by <a href="https://gorjeti.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gorjeti</a>, embellished denim jacket by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/phalliccvnt/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phallic Cvnt</a> and patchwork pants from <a href="https://hardeman.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hardeman Jeans Couture</a>.</p>

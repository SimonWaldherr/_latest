description: > 
  I f, as psychologists suggest, it takes an estimated eight truths to redeem one lie then the government sanctioning of police access to NHS test-and-trace data is going to need a lot of work to recover from such a betrayal of trust.In selling the virtues of those in England handing over personal information to the government we were assured that this would be confidential.That of course should be a given and not need the emphasis it was given when the system was introduced.

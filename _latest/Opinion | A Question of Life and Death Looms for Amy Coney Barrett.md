  Opinion | A Question of Life and Death Looms for Amy Coney Barrett 
description: > 
  In “Catholic Judges in Capital Cases,” a 1998 Marquette Law Review article, Judge Barrett and her co-author, John Garvey, now the president of the Catholic University of America, argued that Catholic judges had no choice but to recuse themselves when facing certain death penalty cases.“We believe that Catholic judges (if they are faithful to the teaching of their church) are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty,” they wrote.“This means that they can neither themselves sentence criminals to death nor enforce jury recommendations of death.”In her career, Judge Barrett has wrestled with this question of what to do.But she had assisted with capital cases when she was a clerk, and she voted recently to allow an execution to proceed.Perhaps her assent to capital punishment in certain cases arises from the fact that the church has historically wavered on the death penalty’s legitimacy.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Bishop Flores paused in our conversation, collecting his thoughts. He spoke quickly, alert and energetic, clearly disturbed by the fact of execution, and what it entails.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;We isolate them, and then we inject their veins &#8212; and it&#8217;s like they&#8217;ve completely been stripped of their humanity at that moment,&#8221; he reflected. But the Catholic Church holds that human dignity can never be effaced, even when a person is unborn, even when a person is ill and dying, even when a person is guilty of terrible crimes. &#8220;This is a human being,&#8221; the bishop told me. &#8220;And the state has decided what the state has decided, but there&#8217;s a justice beyond this.&#8221;</p><p class="css-6cdk4e e6idgb70">***</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Judge Barrett is well aware of the justice beyond our earthly simulacrum.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In &#8220;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/527/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Catholic Judges in Capital Cases</a>,&#8221; a 1998 Marquette Law Review article, Judge Barrett and her co-author, John Garvey, now the president of the Catholic University of America, argued that Catholic judges had no choice but to recuse themselves when facing certain death penalty cases.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;We believe that Catholic judges (if they are faithful to the teaching of their church) are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;This means that they can neither themselves sentence criminals to death nor enforce jury recommendations of death.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In her career, Judge Barrett has wrestled with this question of what to do. She reaffirmed in her 2017 confirmation hearings for her appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit that as a trial judge she would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/amy-barrett-views-issues.html" title="">recuse</a> herself from sentencing in capital cases. But she had assisted with capital cases when she was a clerk, and she <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/20-2128/20-2128-2020-07-10.pdf?ts=1594420215" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted</a> recently to allow an execution to proceed.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Perhaps her assent to capital punishment in certain cases arises from the fact that the church has historically wavered on the death penalty&#8217;s legitimacy. In the article she wrote with Mr. Garvey, the two said that the church&#8217;s &#8220;prohibitions against abortion and euthanasia (properly defined) are absolute; those against war and capital punishment are not.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Yet it&#8217;s hard to maintain that room for permissible capital punishment remains in Catholic thought. Earlier this month, Pope Francis published &#8220;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fratelli Tutti</a>,&#8221; an encyclical calling on Catholics to better realize the love of Christ in our relationships with one another and the world. He addressed capital punishment in that context: &#8220;The firm rejection of the death penalty shows to what extent it is possible to recognize the inalienable dignity of every human being and to accept that he or she has a place in this universe. If I do not deny that dignity to the worst of criminals, I will not deny it to anyone. I will give everyone the possibility of sharing this planet with me, despite all our differences.&#8221;</p></div>

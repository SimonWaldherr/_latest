 <p>     </p> <p>Police arrested the pair at the scene with inquiries revealing both had been drinking heavily.</p> <p>At Tameside Magistrates' Court, Jackson, who lives alone with her Pomeranian dog, pleaded guilty to outraging public decency and was fined &#163;50 and made subject of a 12-month community order.</p> <p>JPs imposed a Contempt of Court order banning details of her address being made public after Jackson claimed she was "in fear" of being found by an ex-partner. </p> <p>Pisani, of Stalybridge, is also accused of outraging public decency will appear in court for sentence in December.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>The incident occurred on August 10 this year after Jackson was her way to collect her dog from a property in Ashton-under-Lyne. </p> <p>Prosecutor Gareth Hughes said: "Police received a call a 999 call from a member of the public and they believed that there was a female being raped on the floor in the road or on the pavement at a junction on Market Street in Stalybridge.</p> <p>"It was 15.43pm so in broad daylight in Stalybridge town centre. The council CCTV operators have then seen via the cameras Mr Pisani and Miss Jackson kissing outside Bar Liquid in Market Street.</p> <p>"The camera moves on briefly and comes back and the couple are lay on the pavement cuddling and then Miss Jackson pulls Pisani on top of her and they start having sex on the pavement. </p>

 <p>"Members of the public can be seen in the vicinity walking past whilst this is going on and it is seen by numerous people at what was a fairly busy time of the day.</p> <p>"Police officers attended and arrested the pair. They were interviewed and no comment was made in interview from both parties. Both accept it and have pleaded guilty. The other defendant will sentenced at a future date."</p> <p>In mitigation, defence lawyer Christopher Squibbs said: "Kate accepts she's guilty in relation to this highly embarrassing incident. She's embarrassed by what's going on in literally in broad daylight and the implications are clear.</p> <p>"On that particular day, she had fled her ex-partner's address as a result of ongoing problems. She had a dog in Ashton and was trying to get a train back. </p>

 <p>"The trains were not running from Ashton so she found her way to Stalybridge and was told there was going to be a delay for a train."</p> <p>He added: "She was waiting outside and then struck up a conversation with a male and after being offered White Storm cider, her recollection then becomes particularly hazy. </p> <p>"She has medication for bipolar and personality disorder and taking particularly strong alcohol is likely to have led to this situation happening and it's highly embarrassing for her.</p> <p>"She now wants to move forward. She resides on her own with her Pomeranian dog and she's a woman who has experienced domestic violence in previous relationships and experienced domestic violence through her partner before.</p> <p>"She is fearful of her identity coming to light allowing her ex-partner who lives in Manchester to become aware of her whereabouts. Clearly there is ongoing needs for this lady and she has a long road for her getting well and moving forward. "It's highly embarrassing to her and she is devastated to be in this position "</p> <p>In addition to a &#163;50 fine, Jackson, who lives at a house on state handouts, was also ordered to pay &#163;180 in costs and surcharges.&#160; </p></div>

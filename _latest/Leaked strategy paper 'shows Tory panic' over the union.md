  Leaked strategy paper 'shows Tory panic' over the union 
description: > 
  Continuing to dismiss calls for a new independence referendum could be counterproductive but the campaign to save the union is “rudderless”, senior Tories have been secretly warned.A leaked strategy document prepared by a political consultancy firm with links to the Conservatives, and circulated to figures including Michael Gove, put forward a series of possible tactics for dealing with a surge in support for the SNP and independence.The memo, which was obtained by the Bloomberg news agency, suggests that a “velvet no” approach, involving rejecting a referendum in the short term, could buy time but that an overhaul to the devolution settlement could also be needed.Further devolution of powers could be rolled out after an SNP majority win next May, it is claimed, and eventually be put to the public in a referendum in an effort to “placate” demands for leaving the UK.Other ideas put forward included pressuring the European Union to publicly reject the idea of Scotland rejoining the bloc as an independent country.

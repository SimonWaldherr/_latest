  Whitey Ford, the Yankees' famous ‘Chairman of the Board,’ dies at age 91 
description: > 
  All of those lofty achievements were more than enough to get Ford elected to the Hall of Fame in 1974 along with his best friend and off-the-field “running mate” Mickey Mantle, but, in retrospect, probably didn’t surprise him.Almost from the time the Yankees signed him to a $7,000 bonus in 1947 following his graduation from the Manhattan School of Aviation Trades and a stint with Astoria’s 34th Street Boys in the Queens-Nassau high school league, Ford was always supremely confident in his ability.That was more than evidenced after his 1949 season with Binghamton (in which he was 16-5 and led the Eastern League in strikeouts and a 1.61 ERA) when the then 20-year old Ford telephoned the Yankees' chief scout Paul Kritchell and volunteered his services to the big club for the last couple of weeks of the season.

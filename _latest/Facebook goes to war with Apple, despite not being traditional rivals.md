<div><p>Nobody could ever forget the day that Apple pulled the plug on Facebook.</p>
<p>On a January morning in 2019, the social network&#8217;s then 35,000 employees woke up to discover that everything involving an iPhone was broken: their calendars, their maps of the company campus, their internal social networks and even their food-hall menus.</p>
<p>Meetings were cancelled because people couldn&#8217;t catch the campus shuttle buses, while work on any iPhone apps slammed to a halt as the test versions failed to boot up.</p>
<p>It could have been a cyberattack, but was in fact a show of force. Apple, incensed by the revelation that Facebook had exploited its workplace software scheme to spy on the habits of iPhone users as young as 13, had revoked the credentials that allowed Facebook&#8217;s internal iPhone apps to function the previous evening.</p>
<p>And so, in the midst of that chaos, perhaps sitting in the glass-walled office that employees call &#8220;the fishbowl&#8221;, what must Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg have been thinking?&#160;</p>
<p>That jolt may help&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/26/facebook-warns-iphone-apps-ad-revenues-will-plummet-due-apple/">explain the caustic PR warfare</a> that has erupted between the two companies. In&#160;the past six months, Facebook has become Apple&#8217;s chief antagonist, airing its gripes with investors, the media, its own employees and even the regulators writing the rules that will govern digital services for the next decade.</p>
<p>That is despite the companies <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/09/30/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-have-plan-kill-iphone/">not being traditional rivals</a>: Apple sells hardware and runs subscription services; Facebook gets 98 per cent of its income through advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Apple has] this unique stranglehold as a gatekeeper on what gets on phones,&#8221; Mr Zuckerberg told his workers in August, adding that it &#8220;blocks innovation, blocks competition&#8221; and charges &#8220;monopoly rents&#8221;.</p>
<p>His chief lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg and head of the Facebook app Fidji Simo likewise slammed the smartphone maker. The latter <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/16/apples-30pc-app-tax-has-outstayed-welcome/">labelled its 30 per cent app fee as the &#8220;App Store tax&#8221;</a>:&#160;confrontational language previously confined to Apple&#8217;s more bellicose critics, such as Fortnite maker Epic Games.&#160;</p>

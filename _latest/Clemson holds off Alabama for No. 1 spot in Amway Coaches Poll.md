Alabama’s impressive performance in its prime-time showdown with Georgia earned the Crimson Tide a couple more first-place votes, but not enough to overtake Clemson for the No. 1 position in the Amway Coaches Poll.

Clemson, who put up 73 points earlier in the day in a pounding of Georgia Tech, holds the top spot on 52 of the 62 ballots. Alabama received eight first-place votes, just three more than last week.

The voters were kind to the Bulldogs, who led Alabama at intermission but were blanked in the second half. Georgia falls just one place to No. 4 behind Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish managed a lackluster home win against Louisville but kept their record unblemished.

Ohio State rounds out the top five, with the Buckeyes and the rest of the Big Ten finally set to kick off this weekend. Some members of the panel continue to hold off on voting for teams yet to take the field, so the Big Ten as a whole might get a jump in next week’s poll.

  G4S stepped up its defence against the “opportunistic” and “very highly leveraged” GardaWorld in the latest salvo of the hostile takeover battle for the FTSE 250 security firm.Its board urged shareholders to reject GardaWorld’s 190p per share bid again after the Canadian rival made a firm offer to investors on Saturday.It claimed the £3bn offer “significantly undervalues” the “fundamentally re-positioned” company and attacked GardaWorld's debt pile.“We believe that GardaWorld needs G4S in order to realise its aspirations,” the board of G4S told investors in response to the offer document.The response from the security outsourcer was just the latest shot in a war of words between the two companies.

<div><p>G4S stepped up its defence against&#160;the &#8220;opportunistic&#8221; and &#8220;very highly leveraged&#8221; <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/07/g4s-spurns-latest-gardaworld-advances/">GardaWorld</a> in the latest salvo of the hostile takeover battle for the FTSE 250 security firm.</p>
<p>Its board urged shareholders to reject GardaWorld&#8217;s 190p per share bid again after the Canadian rival&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/17/advisers-line-300m-fees-bonanza-hostile-bidder-g4s-makes-firm/">made a firm offer to investors on Saturday</a>. It claimed the &#163;3bn offer &#8220;significantly undervalues&#8221; the &#8220;fundamentally re-positioned&#8221; company and attacked GardaWorld's debt pile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that GardaWorld needs G4S in order to realise its aspirations,&#8221; the board of G4S told investors in response to the offer document.</p>
<p>It added: &#8220;GardaWorld is a very highly leveraged business that has grown through a string of acquisitions and which has incurred net losses of C$940 million over the past three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>GardaWorld has given shareholders until Nov 7 to accept its 190p per share offer for G4S. The response from the security outsourcer was just the latest shot in a war of words between the two companies.</p>

The <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/steelers/2020/10/18/pittsburgh-steelers-cleveland-browns-score-afc-north-baker-mayfield/3704867001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">supposedly resurgent Browns appeared fraudulent</a>. The Dan Quinn-less (and previously winless) Falcons resembled&#160;a playoff team. The <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/patriots/2020/10/18/new-england-patriots-denver-broncos-score/3704665001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Patriots fell to 2-3 for the first time since 2001</a>. The Ravens showed why they might be the best team in the league for three quarters ... and then <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/ravens/2020/10/18/baltimore-ravens-philadelphia-eagles-score/3705003001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">gave up 22 to the Eagles in the final one</a>. Go figure&#160;&#8211; I'll certainly continue trying.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>2. </strong>The Seahawks, Steelers and Titans (barely) are now the only remaining unbeatens. Which one should be power ranked No. 1? I'll throw a dart and let you know Tuesday morning.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>3. </strong>New York improved to 1-11, the Giants <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/giants/2020/10/18/new-york-giants-washington-football-team-score/3704767001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">breaking through for their first win of the season</a>. The Jets, however, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/jets/2020/10/18/new-york-jets-winless-adam-gase-miami-dolphins-score/3706325001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">dropped to 0-6</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>4. </strong>The Colts trailed the Bengals 21-0 in the second quarter but <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2020/10/18/indianapolis-colts-erase-21-point-deficit-rally-beat-bengals/3705305001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">stormed back to prevail 31-27</a>. At least one team in all six weeks of this season has surmounted&#160;at least a 16-point deficit to win, something that never happened in the league's first 100 seasons.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>5. </strong>The Jets got throttled&#160;by Miami, the first team to be shut out in 2020.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>6. </strong>Adam Gase was actually 16-8 in South Florida while coaching the Dolphins. But, no surprise, he's 0-2 at Miami since becoming coach of the Jets.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>7. </strong>2020 scoreboard: Tom Brady 4, Bill Belichick 2.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>8. </strong>The Battle of the Bays was anything but as the Buccaneers humiliated the Packers 38-10. Aaron Rodgers, who hadn't been intercepted all season entering the game, threw two in a span of three passes&#160;&#8211; including the third pick-six of his career.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>9. </strong>Nice to see <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/buccaneers/2020/10/18/rob-gronkowski-catches-first-td-679-days-and-first-buccaneers/3705881001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">TE Rob Gronkowski reach the end zone</a> for the first time since he joined Tampa Bay. It was Gronk's first TD catch since he and Tom Brady last hooked up for the Patriots on Dec. 9, 2018&#160;&#8211; 679 days ago.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>10. </strong>Need to win a game? Fire your coach. Interim HCs are now 2-0 in their 2020 debuts, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2020/10/18/falcons-respond-to-quinn-firing-with-40-23-win-vs-vikings/114436002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">the Falcons' Raheem Morris</a> following the Texans' Romeo Crennel into the win column.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>11. </strong>The Bucs' rout of Green Bay means the Packers and Bears are now tied atop the NFC North at 5-1. I know you're loving it, Chicago fans ... as you should.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>12. </strong>The Bears continue to struggle mightily while running the ball&#160;&#8211; averaging 2.5 yards per carry Sunday at Carolina&#160;&#8211; but QB Nick Foles punched in a TD on 1-yard sneak, making Chicago the last NFL team to score points in the third quarter this season.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>13. </strong>The Browns still haven't won in Pittsburgh since 2003.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>14. </strong>Which is to also say, Steelers QB (and Ohio native)&#160;Ben Roethlisberger has never lost to Cleveland at Heinz Field.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>15. </strong>The Steelers are now 5-0 for only the second time in franchise history, the other being 1978&#160;&#8211; when the Steel Curtain went on to win Super Bowl XIII. But though Pittsburgh thrashed the Browns (now 4-2) 38-7 on Sunday, the Steelers' other four wins have come against opponents with a combined five wins.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>16. </strong>Congrats to Giants rookie head coach Joe Judge, the last of the five new head coaches in 2020 to notch a win. His special teams background surely helped, the G-Men covering an onside kick in the final minute far more effectively than, say, the Falcons would.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>17. </strong>The Titans' 601 yards of offense in their <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/titans/2020/10/18/tennessee-titans-houston-texans-score-afc-south-derrick-henry/3704949001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">42-36 overtime defeat of the Texans</a> were the most in franchise history, besting the previous mark of the 1991 Houston Oilers (583 yards).</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry (22) celebrates as he leaves the field after scoring the winning touchdown in overtime against the Houston Texans at Nissan Stadium."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>18. </strong>Tennessee is the only team in the last 70 years to win a game after playing the previous Tuesday. Of course, the 2010 Vikings were the only other club since 1950 that&#160;had the opportunity to pull that off.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>19. </strong>After racking up&#160;212 rushing yards Sunday, Titans RB Derrick Henry became the first man in NFL annals to post a 200-yard effort on the ground in three successive seasons.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>19a. </strong>Houston has allowed an opposing rusher to gain at least 130 yards three times this season.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>20. </strong>Ravens DL Calais Campbell produced at least three sacks in a game for the fourth time in his career Sunday.&#160;However Campbell didn't get a ton of help from his Baltimore teammates, who entered Week 6 with the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense. The Ravens allowed 28 points and 364 yards in Philadelphia, most they'd surrendered on either front in any of their five wins of 2020.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>20a.</strong> Good thing Baltimore scored 30 points&#160;&#8211; the 29th consecutive regular-season game in which the Ravens notched at least 20. Only Peyton Manning and the 2012-2014 Broncos have a longer streak (30 games) in NFL history.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>21. </strong>Given the seeming volatility of this season, don't count out Detroit just yet. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2020/10/18/detroit-lions-jacksonville-jaguars-score-dandre-swift/3704830001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">The Lions handled the Jaguars</a> 34-16, Jacksonville the only team they've faced that didn't have at least three wins in the first five weeks.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>22.</strong> Bummer to see <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2020/10/18/red-zones-andrew-siciliano-out-positive-covid-19-test/3703357001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Andrew&#160;Siciliano's Favre-ian streak of&#160;260 consecutive starts</a> on DirecTV's&#160;Sunday Ticket Red Zone Channel, which launched&#160;in 2005, come to an end due to a positive COVID-19 test.&#160;Siciliano subsequently had a negative retest Sunday morning but chose to stay home in deference to the safety of the&#160;Red Zone Channel's production team.&#160;Siciliano is one of the nicer guys you'll meet on the media side of this industry&#160;&#8211; here's hoping for a confirmed false positive ... or a speedy recovery if need be.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>22a. </strong>Siciliano remains safely ahead of Colts QB&#160;Philip Rivers, whose streak of 230 consecutive regular-season starts began in 2006 and reached 230 Sunday &#8211; a figure that allowed him to pass Hall of Famer&#160;Bruce Matthews for fourth most in league history ... though still 30 shy of Siciliano's Iron man streak.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>23. </strong>Sunday was only the fifth time in the last five regular seasons that Falcons WR Julio Jones had two TDs in one game. He's never had three.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>24. </strong>Vikings QB Kirk Cousins has 20 multi-interception games in his career after throwing three picks Sunday. His team is 0-20 on such days.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>25.&#160;</strong>Jon Brown became the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/jaguars/2020/10/18/jon-brown-jacksonville-jaguars-kicker-field-goal-attempt/3703574001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">fifth kicker to score for the Jags</a> this year, connecting on a 31-year field goal and an extra point. What makes that performances unique for Brown? It marked the first time the 27-year-old, a former college soccer player, had ever attempted a FG or PAT during a game <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/08/06/cincinnati-bengals-jonathan-brown-kicker-louisville-kentucky-soccer/837630002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">at any level of football</a>. Maybe Jacksonville should let Brown play quarterback, too ... or even coach.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>26. </strong>Speaking of kickers, Denver's&#160;Brandon McManus 18, New England 12. Who says special teams is only one-third of the game?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>27. </strong>Patriots WR&#160;Julian Edelman, who played quarterback at Kent State, attempted two passes in an NFL game for the first time in his 12-year career&#160;&#8211; completing both for 38 yards, including a 16-yarder to QB Cam Newton. Edelman, who was far more effective Sunday than Newton (2 INTs) &#8211; apparently rusty following his COVID-19 quarantine &#8211; has now connected on all six of the regular-season throws he's attempted as a pro.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>28.</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/dolphins/2020/10/18/tua-tagovailoa-miami-dolphins-nfl-debut-jets/3706431001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Dolphins rookie QB&#160;Tua Tagovailoa made his NFL debut Sunday</a>, completing two throws&#160;for 9 yards. He's got a ways to go to be as good a passer as Edelman.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>29. </strong>The Jets seem to have very few players to build around, but S Marcus Maye &#8211; unsigned beyond this season &#8211; might be one. He snared one of the crazies interceptions you'll ever see Sunday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>30. </strong>Give Washington Football Team coach "Riverboat" Ron Rivera points for consistency. He went for two rather than kick a game-tying extra point with 36 seconds remaining in his team's 20-19 loss to the Giants. Rivera benched starting QB Dwayne Haskins two weeks ago because he felt Washington could conquer&#160;a weak NFC East. Rivera's assessment may be off, but at least the message is unwavering.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>31. </strong>Giants QB Daniel Jones has a team-high 204 rushing yards after bolting for&#160;a career-high 74 on Sunday. Good thing he can run for his life &#8211; unlike predecessor Eli Manning, who never ran for more than 80 yards ... in a season.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>32. </strong>This seems apropos given the Jets are pretty clearly the NFL's 32nd-best team&#160;&#8211; and the league's only winless outfit after the Giants and Falcons both won. New York now officially owns the inside track to the No. 1 pick of the 2021 draft, which will almost certainly be spent on Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence. Of course, the only time the Jets previously started 0-6 was 1996, when they finished 1-15. But they didn't get to use the top pick of the 1997 draft on Peyton Manning ... because he opted to play his senior season for the University of Tennessee. New York ultimately dealt the No. 1 selection to the Rams, who used it on Ohio State OT Orlando Pace.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">***</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Follow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ByNateDavis" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">@ByNateDavis</a></p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/nfl/2020/10/18/nfl-week-6-best-photos/3703410001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

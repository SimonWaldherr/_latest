  The government will score an own goal by rejecting Marcus Rashford’s call to extend free school meals 
description: > 
  Mr Rashford’s advantage is amplified, of course, by his being on the side of hungry children looking for a meal over the school holidays.Mr Baker has monetarism on his side.And yet it seems Mr Rashford will not produce a repeat of his stunning campaign in the summer, which saw Boris Johnson order a swift U-turn on the issue.Local authorities, such as Greater Manchester, forced into tier 3 restrictions are being given inadequate resources on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.And the concession to hard-pressed families facing food poverty during school holidays is not to be repeated, even though many face the same financial hardship that they did in the summer.

<div><p>n a national popularity contest between Marcus Rashford , gifted young Premier League star, and Steve Baker MP, self-styled &#8220;Brexit hardman&#8221; and former chair of the European Research Group , it is not difficult to imagine who might win. Mr Rashford&#8217;s advantage is amplified, of course, by his being on the side of hungry children looking for a meal over the school holidays. Mr Baker has monetarism on his side.</p><p>And yet it seems Mr Rashford will not produce a repeat of his stunning campaign in the summer, which saw Boris Johnson order a swift U-turn on the issue. Now the mood in government <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rishi-sunak-furlough-jobs-lockdown-eat-out-to-help-out-vince-cable-b1181852.html">seems to have changed</a>. In short, it is getting tighter over money. The furlough scheme to protect jobs will end within days, to be replaced by a less generous support programme. Local authorities, such as Greater Manchester, forced into tier 3 restrictions are being given inadequate resources on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. And the concession to hard-pressed families facing food poverty during school holidays is not to be repeated, even though many face the same financial hardship that they did in the summer.</p></div>

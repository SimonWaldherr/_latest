<p>"This year I would say anecdotally there is a younger crowd. They're folks in their 20s and 30s and there's just a sense of stir crazy, a little bit of wanderlust, there's not a lot of planning going on. They're clearly not getting the messages, all the advisories we're putting out, the things that are on websites indicating that this isn't the year to come," <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/10/16/salem-halloween-2020-coronavirus-mayor-kim-driscoll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll.</a></p><p>Baker is speaking in Salem a day after he spoke in Revere about the<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/massachusetts-covid-vaccine-distribution-plan-2020-10-20/" target="_blank"> state's plan to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine</a> once one or more become available.</p><p>Officials anticipate limited supply in the early phase and plan to prioritize some health care workers, people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 &#8211; including people with underlying medical conditions and those older than 65 &#8211; and other essential workers, Baker said. &#160;</p><p></p></div>

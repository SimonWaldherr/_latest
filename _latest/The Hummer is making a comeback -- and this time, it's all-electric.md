  General Motors revealed the new all-electric GMC Hummer EV Tuesday night, officially bringing back the Hummer name after a decade.Hummer had been known for making large, rugged off-road capable SUVs and trucks that were often criticized for burning lots of gas.This Hummer pickup truck, however, will burn no gasoline at all.The GMC Hummer EV has four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering and an "Extract Mode" so the truck lifts itself up over obstacles.Another difference: Hummer is now a GMC model rather than its own separate brand.

The truck will also be available with the latest version of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/04/cars/cadillac-escalade/index.html" target="_blank"> GM's Super Cruise technology</a> that enables hands-free driving on major highways.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">A special driving mode will enable the truck to accelerate from zero-to-60 miles per hour in about three seconds, according to GM. The truck will be able to drive more than 350 miles on a full charge, according to GM's testing.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The Hummer EV's adjustable air suspension system features an Extract Mode that raises the truck by as much as six inches to make it easier to drive over obstacles or out of deep mud. Video cameras can provide up to 18 different views around and under the truck to help while driving around obstacles.</p><span class="el__storyelement__header"><a href="/2020/10/19/cars/hummer-electric-fans/index.html">Hummer fans hope new electric model redeems the divisive brand they love</a></span><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The truck also has removable roof panels that can store in the truck's "frunk," or front trunk. The back window also rolls down to allow for a fully open air driving experience.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The battery packs will be protected by steel plates to prevent damage during off-road driving.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">All of this will not come cheaply, though.

A less powerful version of the truck, with only two motors, will be available in 2024 for $80,000, according to GM. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The Hummer will be the most expensive truck GMC offers, but its capability and design will make it well worth the price, Aldred said.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"We really knew we had an element of great desire," he said.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The Hummer EV was developed in just two years, Aldred said, from initial conception to final production. That is almost certainly the shortest development time for any vehicle in General Motors' history, he said.

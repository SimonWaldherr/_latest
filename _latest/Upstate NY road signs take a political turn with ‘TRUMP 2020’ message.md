Someone hacked a handful of upstate road-work signs to boost President Trump’s reelection and nettle Gov. Cuomo over his coronavirus response Wednesday.

The trickster got the light-up variable-message signs to display missives including “TRUMP 2020” and “CUOMO KILLED NY.”

“I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” said Beacon resident Erin Mayne Kleinke, who posted snapshots of the unusual signs on her Facebook page. “I wasn’t sure who was doing the work and I thought, ‘Jeez, somebody’s going to be in trouble.'”

“Maybe it was hacked, I don’t know,” Kleinke told The Post. “I don’t know.”

Kleinke said she spotted the signs while driving on Washington Avenue in the town of Fishkill near the Beacon border shortly before 7 a.m., and figured they were tweaked by a prankster or a politically motivated vandal.

She said she drove by the signs later in the morning and noticed they were turned away from the road — and even later saw they were fixed.

In all she snapped four signs, with the two others reading, “TRUMP 2020 MAGA!!!” and another said, “YOU WILL BE LATE!”

Fishkill town officials could not be reached by The Post Wednesday evening.

But according to a report by the Hudson Valley Post earlier in the day, Fishkill Supervisor Ozzy Albra confirmed that the road sign mishap had been addressed and the signs restored to perform their intended tasks.

“It’s a private construction sign notifying residents of a future road closing,” Albra told the outlet. “And unknown person changed the text and since has been corrected.”

The Hudson Valley Post also reached out to ADMAR Construction Equipment & Supplies, which said the signs can be reprogrammed manually but added that the company does not control the signs once they are installed at the side of the road.

Meanwhile, officials in Gov. Cuomo’s office were not amused by the bogus roadside messages — and blamed it on Trump supporters.

Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi claimed Trump supporters fiddled with the sign.

“But we are focused on stamping out (coronavirus) hot spots, ensuring New York continues to have one of the lowest infection rates in the country and preventing a second weave,” he added.

<p>Trump has continued to relentlessly attack Whitmer even after several members of a Michigan militia were arrested last week and charged with plotting to kidnap Whitmer in response to business restrictions and safety measures like requiring masks she instituted in the state to help stem the spread of COVID-19. They consider the restrictions tyrannical. &#8220;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/whitmer-kidnapping-michigan-militia-trump_n_5f7f32a5c5b600470a99510d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grab the fuckin&#8217; Governor</a>.

The former Navy SEAL who shot dead Osama bin Laden hit out at the QAnon conspiracy theory pushed by President Donald Trump that claims Biden had SEAL Team Six killed after the raid.

Robert O'Neill, 44, appeared with Chris Cuomo on CNN on Wednesday night to voice his disgust that the 'highest-ranking person in the country' would be 'trampling on the graves of some of the best heroes' by claiming the team had not killed Bin Laden.

The online theory has suggested that O'Neill only killed a body double of bin Laden in the 2011 raid and that the Obama and Biden administration were implicated in the killing of the mission's team to cover it up.

It also claims that bin Laden is still alive.

The former Navy SEAL who shot dead Osama bin Laden, Robert O'Neill, hit out at the QAnon theory that claims the terrorist leader is still alive in an interview on CNN Wednesday

Trump retweeted the conspiracy theory this week, angering O'Neill

The idea was formed by QAnon, the far-right conspiracy theory centered on the baseless belief that Trump is secretly fighting enemies in the 'deep state' and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals.

Yet this week, the idea became more mainstream as Trump himself retweeted posts and a video promoting the conspiracy about bin Laden's death.

O'Neill, who is vocal about his conservative leanings, blasted the president as Cuomo questioned him on how it felt to see the rumors circulating, stating that this was 'bigger than a retweet'.

'I want to say that every man is alive [who was on that mission],' he told Cuomo, pushing back against suggestions the team had made a mistake with bin Laden's DNA and that they hand flown the body of the double into the mountains to hide the mistake.

He also laughed off claims that Hillary Clinton had ordered a missile to strike down SEAL team Six when the mistake was realized.

'We went in there, we kissed our kids goodbye, and we were expecting death but we were willing to do it because of what had happened on 9/11,' he said.

'To see this on the internet now is due to politics and its an insult to the real people.

'It's a shame we've gotten there because of politics,' he added.

He said that SEAL Team Six had taken many pictures from the night of the raid with bin Laden's body and that they had waited until they were absolutely certain it was him following the DNA test.

'This is comical, if you know the truth, then you are fine,' he added. 'If there is a time to release the photos, it is now.

'I've been getting texts from other guys on the mission saying, "I didn't know we were dead, did you? What did you do in there?"'

O'Neill spoke to Chris Cuomo on CNN about his anger at the QAnon conspiracy theory

Cuomo asked O'Neill about his politics, stating that he knows he is 'not a Biden fan' but asking how it felt for Trump to be the person sharing the theories.

'It's one thing for a wacko to be a conspiracy theorist and to claim this but to be retweeted by the highest-ranking person in the country,' O'Neill said of his disappointment.

'Biden or Trump, I'm an American.'

O'Neill also mentioned how he had been using his Twitter account throughout Wednesday to poke fun at the claims despite his anger.

He joked that he must have killed 'Osama bin Johnson' before taking a more serious tune in refuting the claims that the mission team were killed.

'Every SEAL from the UBL Mission is alive while you are reading this,' O'Neill wrote.

On Tuesday, he also paid tribute to Obama, who was president at the time of the raid.

'Very brave men said goodbye to their kids to go kill Osama bin Laden. We were given the order by President Obama. It was not a body double. Thank you Mr. President. Happy birthday @USNavy,' he said.

O'Neill joked about the theories on Twitter on Tuesday despite his anger

He reposted this tweet which he hit back at, stating that the entire team are still alive

O'Neill also honored Barack Obama who was the president who ordered the raid

He later joked about the theories again, sharing a picture of himself enjoying a drink on a lounge chair as he wrote: 'The right: OMG, you killed a body double. Me:'

O'Neill even slapped back at an account that questioned him stating: 'I know who I killed, homie. Every time.'

Trump retweeted the views on Tuesday from a QAnon account which has since been suspended.

'Hiden Biden and Obama may have had Seal Team 6 killed! EXPLOSIVE: CIA Whistleblower Exposes Biden's Alleged Role with the Deaths of Seal Team- Claims to have Documented Proof. RETWEET!!!' the tweet read, according to Newsweek.

The next day he tweeted a video that claims without evidence that 'three former CIA Directors involved in keeping bin Laden alive in Iran, moved him from Iran to Pakistan for Obama's trophy kill'.

O'Neill joked about the claims that he only shot a body double of bin Laden

Trump has previously slammed Biden over his alleged reluctance over the raid

The theory claims that the Obama and Biden administration had SEAL Team Six killed

Bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid by SEAL Team Six on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan as part of a mission ordered by Obama.

Trump has hit out at his rival Biden, claiming that the former VP had pushed back against the raid in talks with Obama.

O'Neill, pictured, was the person to shoot bin Laden three times in the head during a top-secret May 2011 raid on his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan

'No one has been more wrong, more often than Biden. He voted FOR the Iraq War, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed killing Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and he cheered the rise of China as a “positive development” for America and the world,' he wrote in September.

'If it were up to Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would still be alive, ISIS would be still on the rampage, and China would now be the dominant power in the world – not America.'

Biden was reported to have been skeptical of the raid.

O'Neill served in the Navy since 1995.

He was the person to shoot bin Laden three times in the head during a top-secret May 2011 raid on his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

The Intercept states he was forced from the team shortly after the raid after it was discovered that he was openly bragging about being the man to shoot Bin Laden as he frequented Virginia Beach bars.

O'Neill also took part in the 2009 rescue of the captain of a merchant ship taken hostage by Somali pirates. The mission was later the subject of a Tom Hanks movie named 'Captain Phillips'.

He recently hit headlines again after being banned from Delta for tweetig a pictured of himself not wearing a mask on a flight despite the rules implemented due to the coronavirus pandemic.

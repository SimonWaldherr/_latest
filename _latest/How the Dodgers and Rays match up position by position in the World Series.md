<p><b>Dodgers: </b>Clayton Kershaw, who has a mediocre 11-12 record and 4.31  ERA in 35 career playoff games, 28 of them starts, will start Game 1, but being pushed to seven games in the NLCS will disrupt the team&#8217;s World Series pitching plans. Manager Dave Roberts said he&#8217;ll &#8220;have to be creative&#8221; in Game 2, which could be a bullpen game featuring Dustin May and Tony Gonsolin. Walker Buehler will pitch Game 3, aligning the ace for a potential Game 7, and Julio Ur&#237;as likely will start Game 4.</p>

<p><b>Rays: </b>Tyler Glasnow, the 6-foot-8 right-hander who will start Game 1, can dominate with his high-90s fastball and big curve, but he&#8217;s also given up six homers in 19 1/3 playoff innings. Blake Snell, the left-hander who will start Game 2, features a 95-mph fastball, slider, curve and changeup and has a 3.20 ERA in four playoff starts. Charlie Morton, the veteran right-hander with an 0.46 ERA in three Game 7 appearances (including with the Astros against the Dodgers in 2017), is lined up to start Game 3 and &#8230; Game 7.</p>

Rookie left-hander Victor Gonz&#225;lez has shown promise, but fellow left-handers Adam Kolarek and Jake McGee have been erratic. </p><p><b>Rays:</b> A deep, versatile and often dominant relief corps has allowed manager Kevin Cash to have a short leash with his starters. Right-handers Nick Anderson, who has a lively 95-mph fastball and sharp curve, Pete Fairbanks, who has a 98-mph fastball and wipeout slider, and Diego Castillo, who features a 98-mile two-seam fastball, share closing and setup duties. There are sidearm throwers from the right (Ryan Thompson) and left (Aaron Loup) sides.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

Right-handed-hitting Yandy Diaz or Mike Brosseau could start against the left-handed Kershaw. </p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p><b>Rays</b>: Brandon Lowe hit .269 with a .916 OPS, 14 homers and 37 RBIs in the regular season but has struggled in the postseason, batting .115 with 18 strikeouts.

<p><b>Rays:</b> Willy Adames is no match for Seager offensively &#8212; he hit .259 with eight homers and 23 RBIs in 2020 and is batting .132 with three RBIs in 14 playoff games. But the 25-year-old from the Dominican Republic is a defensive whiz with superb instincts and reflexes, the range to make plays up the middle and in the hole. </p>

<p><b>THIRD BASE</b></p><p><b>Dodgers:</b> Justin Turner has had a quiet postseason compared to his usually robust Octobers, batting .209 with one homer and four RBIs, but that one homer was huge, a solo shot in a three-run first inning of a 3-1 NLCS Game 6 win. He also made a huge defensive play in Game 7, diving to tag Dansby Swanson in a rundown between third and home, scrambling to one knee and throwing out Austin Riley at third to complete a double play.</p><p><b>Rays:</b> Joey Wendle went six for 11 with four runs, one strikeout and one walk in the first three games of the division series, but in nine games since he&#8217;s hit .111 with two RBIs and nine strikeouts.

<p><b>LEFT FIELD</b></p><p><b>Dodgers:</b> AJ Pollock emerged as the everyday starter by hitting a team-high 16 homers and 34 RBIs in the regular season, but his .229 average), no homers and two RBIs in 11 playoff games could turn the position back into a platoon with the left-handed-hitting Joc Pederson, who is batting .375 with a homer and five RBIs in 10 playoff games.</p><p><b>Rays:</b> Randy Arozarena, the 25-year-old rookie from Cuba who missed the start of the season after a positive COVID-19 test, has been the breakout star of the playoffs, batting .382 (21 for 55) with a 1.288 OPS, seven homers 10 RBIs and 14 runs in 14 games.

<p></p><p><b>CENTER FIELD</b></p><p><b>Dodgers:</b> Cody Bellinger didn&#8217;t come close to replicating his 2019 MVP season, batting .239 with 12 homers and 30 RBIs, but he&#8217;s been more locked in October, batting .250 with three homers and 10 RBIs. Bellinger is shortening his swing with two strikes and spoiling tough pitches like he did Sunday, when he capped an eight-pitch at-bat with a game-winning homer in the seventh.</p><p><b>Rays:</b> Kevin Kiermaier won&#8217;t strike fear into opposing pitchers, but his glove will frustrate opposing hitters. Kiermaier has been one of baseball&#8217;s best defensive center fielders since 2010, as he showed in Game 3 of the ALCS, when he made two diving catches, one of a Carlos Correa flare to shallow center with runners on second and third in which Kiermaier covered 64 feet in 3.8 seconds.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p><b>Rays:</b> Manuel Margot has provided surprising power in the playoffs, with five homers and 11 RBIs in 13 games. He also made a superb play in Game 2 of the ALCS, racing into foul territory to make a leaping catch of George Springer&#8217;s slicing drive with two on before tumbling over the wall and falling six feet to the ground. He held onto the ball for the final out.</p>

<p><b>Dodgers:</b> Austin Barnes will catch Kershaw, but Will Smith will handle the bulk of the catching duties.

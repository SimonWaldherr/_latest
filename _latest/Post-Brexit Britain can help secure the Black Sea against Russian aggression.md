The Black Sea region sits at a strategic point between Europe, Eurasia and the Middle East. The current strategic-military and political situation in the wider Black Sea area therefore has serious ramifications for all European and Nato countries. Georgia is the primary Nato/Western ally in the region: strengthening Georgia's ability to support our shared security goals can support regional peace and security, as well as deter our common foes.

Moscow currently executes multiple and varied hybrid instruments and tactics in countries all across the region. The goal is simple: to exercise control over their foreign and security policies, keeping these nations in a state of non-alignment or insecurity relative to Russia and the West. To this end, Russia has deployed military force, cyber domain, information warfare, coercive diplomacy, manipulation of territorial conflicts, exploitation of energy vulnerabilities, application of economic tools, disruption of critical infrastructure, and many other hybrid tactics.

The Georgian government is determined to resist this aggression. We will not be swayed from our publicly-stated goal of closer ties to the West.

Recently, the UK-Georgia Wardrop Strategic Dialogue addressed these challenges. Both governments reinforced our shared commitment to counter this aggression, and to ensure Black Sea security. This includes proactive engagement, such as more frequent port visits by Royal Navy vessels in the region.

Today's warfare is not fought only on the terrestrial battlefield. UK-Georgia strategic cooperation is also closely focused on cybersecurity. Georgia's infrastructure is regularly attacked by the Russian Federation, mot recently on the 1st September this year, when our health research facilities were targeted. Georgia is very much on the frontline of this battlefield. The UK, of course, has suffered similar attacks targeted both at NHS facilities and at institutions involved in developing a Covid vaccine.

With the invaluable assistance of UK experts, the Georgian government is now developing a comprehensive National Cybersecurity Strategy. The support from the government in London has been invaluable, and is a crucial element to protecting not only Georgia but the wider Black Region from ongoing Russian aggression.

Georgia's geographic location, and historic leadership role, means it is seen as a gateway to the region. The Georgian Dream government has invested in transforming Georgia into a multi-dimensional regional hub, including in digital technology. In such an unstable security environment, this can only happen with the strong and continued support of the UK and other our Western partners.

On behalf of the people of Georgia, I want to thank the UK for helping to safeguard the country, and our territorial integrity, against real and present external threats.

I would like to stress that Georgia's path of integration into the Euro-Atlantic security space and to Nato is irreversible. As a government, and a people, we remain wholly committed to this goal. Georgians go to the polls on October 31st in Parliamentary elections. If the Georgian Dream government is re-elected in October, we will accelerate that progress: this is our promise to the Georgian people, and also to our partners in London and around the world.

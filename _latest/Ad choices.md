<div> <p> <br> </p> <p> <i>Published September 16, 2016</i> </p> <p>Online advertising for washingtonpost.com is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick. DoubleClick places cookies on your browser to facilitate serving particular ads &#8211; for instance, to help determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, to tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can opt out of DoubleClick&#8217;s use of cookies for these purposes by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/" shape="rect">http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/</a>.</p> <p>In some cases, we and advertisers on washingtonpost.com and other sites work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and audience segment providers, and they use &#160;cookies, beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited and mobile apps you use) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads on our site and other sites that they believe you would find most relevant.

<div><p>Ashley Graham is being celebrated for her latest stripped-down selfie.</p>
<p>Taking to Instagram on Sunday, the 32-year-old model shared a photo of herself posing naked in front of a mirror, captioning the post, &#8220;Nakie big girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>The steamy shot, which has since amassed over one million &#8220;likes&#8221; as of Monday, was met with countless compliments from Graham&#8217;s famous fans and followers, including Emily Ratajkowski and Helena Christensen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naked beautiful girl,&#8221; Christensen commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beauty girl,&#8221; Ratajkowski responded.</p>
<p>Others praised Graham and her &#8220;real body,&#8221; with one fan eliciting a remark from the model herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate that this is seen as &#8216;big girl&#8217; I see nothing but a beautiful, naturally curvy woman in all her glory &#8230;.. super sexy and womanly,&#8221; the fan penned, to which Graham replied, &#8220;I hear what you&#8217;re saying. But if you look at &#8216;big&#8217; as a positive or love then you can see it like I do. I love my big strong beautiful body. Love you girlie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graham, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/09/23/ashley-graham-makes-her-runway-return-after-giving-birth-in-january/">who returned to the runway</a> last month <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/01/20/model-ashley-graham-gives-birth-to-baby-boy/">after welcoming son Issac</a> with husband Justin Ervin in January, recently opened up about how her stretch marks <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/08/03/ashley-graham-says-her-stretch-marks-make-her-feel-like-a-superhero/">have made her feel like a &#8220;superhero.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always reminded that our bodies were built to do this,&#8221; <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a33396152/ashley-graham-kristen-bell-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graham told Elle</a> in the publication&#8217;s first-ever digital issue. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a beautiful thing to be able to give birth, but I didn&#8217;t realize it until afterward. Before I was even pregnant, that was always my hope for women in general, that they could learn to continue to love their bodies through the changes and the ups and downs.&#8221;</p>

Gareth Southgate was handed a left-back crisis by the Football Association after Kieran Trippier had to pull out of England’s Nations League game against Denmark to appear at a personal hearing over his betting charge.

England manager Southgate was clearly annoyed by the timing of the hearing and the farcical nature of yet more disruption, as Trippier became the eighth player in under a year to miss an international game because of off-the-pitch problems.

And Southgate could face more difficulties, with Eric Dier emerging as a doubt for the Denmark game with a hamstring problem that will upset Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho who is already watching Harry Kane’s situation carefully.

Southgate insisted Kane is 100 per cent fit to start Wednesday night’s game at Wembley, but Spurs are worried about a thigh problem he has been carrying and Mourinho will be furious if his striker suffers any difficulties.

Trippier’s personal hearing will be conducted over video because of coronavirus regulations, with the defender, who captained England in the friendly against Wales last week, facing the threat of a six-month ban relating to bets made around the time of his move from Tottenham to Atletico Madrid in July 2019.

The 30 year-old has insisted that he did not place any bets or profit from any bets and his absence for the Denmark game is a blow to Southgate, who is also without left-back Ben Chilwell who returned to Chelsea as a precaution over the foot injury he has been carrying.

Trippier filled in at left-wing back in each of England’s games against Wales and Belgium, and Southgate must now choose between Arsenal duo Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Bukayo Saka for the position.

With Kyle Walker likely to keep his place in the back three, Trippier’s withdrawal could also hand an opportunity for Chelsea’s Reece James to make his first England start after making his debut from the bench against Wales.

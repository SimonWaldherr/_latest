<div><p>A former New York City Ballet principal dancer claims his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s bombshell lawsuit <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/05/ex-nyc-ballet-dancer-joked-about-abusing-ballerinas-like-farm-animals-suit/">alleging he shared revenge porn</a> was no more than a publicity stunt to bolster her modeling career, according to new court papers.</p>
<p>Chase Finlay &#8212; who was sued by student-dancer Alexandra Waterbury in September 2018 &#8212; also claims that Waterbury attacked him three times in jealous rages during their sporadic two-year relationship, according to Manhattan Supreme court papers filed Friday.</p>
<p>Since filing suit, Waterbury &#8220;has maligned Mr. Finlay and made numerous malicious, false and/or misleading statements about him to the public both in the press and on social media to promote her own career ambitions,&#8221; the court papers allege.</p>
<p>Finlay says that the pair&#8217;s relationship &#8212; which spanned 2016 through 2018 &#8212; was &#8220;marked by jealously and an excessive use of alcohol by both individuals,&#8221; which escalated to her hitting him on three occasions &#8212; May 13, 2017, Nov. 22, 2017 and Jan. 30, 2018, the court documents claim.</p>
<p>One of the alleged attacks left Finlay with a black eye, the court papers allege.</p>
<p>Then after Waterbury discovered that Finlay had sent racy pictures of her to other NYCB dancers she began demanding money from him and at least one other person in exchange for keeping quiet about the incident, the filings allege.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure city ballet would looooooove this,&#8221; Waterbury allegedly texted Finlay on May 25, 2018 as she demanded a $20,000 payment, the court papers claim.</p>
<p>And despite Finlay asking Waterbury to return the keys to his apartment that same day, she used them to enter his place and take some 200-pages worth of screen shots from his computer without his permission, the court documents allege.</p>
<p>Waterbury eventually dropped her demand for the payment from Finlay and others, bragging to another dancer that with a lawsuit she &#8220;&#8216;would win a lot&#8217; of money because the NYCB had insurance companies that would pay her and the NYCB was worth a half a billion dollars,&#8221; the court papers claim.</p>
<p>While Waterbury did sue the Ballet company and three other men, a judge <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/28/nyc-ballet-cleared-in-porn-suit-as-case-against-ex-dancer-proceeds/">has since tossed out those claims</a> leaving only one claim against Finlay for sending the pictures.</p>
<p>Finlay also claims that Waterbury and her legal team lied about the pair&#8217;s age gap &#8212; claiming he was 29 rather than 26 while she was 19 &#8212; &#8220;in an apparent effort to make the difference in their ages greater than they appear and sensationalize this lawsuit,&#8221; the court filings charge.</p>
<p>Finlay is asking a judge to dismiss Waterbury&#8217;s case and grant him unspecified damages against her.</p>
<p>Finlay resigned in the wake of the scandal in 2018 and hasn&#8217;t danced professionally since, the court papers say.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unfortunate that after all that he has done to Ms. Waterbury, as alleged in the complaint, that Mr. Finlay has engaged in this type of conduct,&#8221; Waterbury&#8217;s lawyer Jordan Merson told The Post. &#8220;The counterclaims are baseless, retaliatory and we are confident that they will be dismissed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ms. Waterbury will not be intimidated and she will continue to fight to protect herself and others from enduring a similar fate,&#8221; Merson said.</p>
<p>Finlay&#8217;s lawyer declined to comment.</p>

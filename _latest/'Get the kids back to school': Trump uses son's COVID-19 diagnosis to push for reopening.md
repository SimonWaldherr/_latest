Barron Trump’s positive test for COVID-19 has become part of his father’s push to physically reopen schools.

“It happens,'' President Trump told a crowd at a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa of his 14-year-old son testing positive for the coronavirus. "People have it, and it goes. Get the kids back to school. We’ve got to get them back to school.”

Of Barron Trump testing positive for the coronavirus, the president also said, "He had the China virus, right? And he had it for such a short period of time. I don’t even think he knew he had it because they’re young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off 99.9 percent. And Barron is beautiful, and he’s free, free.”

Melania Trump says son Barron tested positive for COVID-19, had no symptoms

First lady Melania Trump said Wednesday that after an initial negative test, 14-year-old Barron Trump tested positive for COVID-19, but is now negative.

"My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive," she said. "Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms. In one way I was glad the three of us went through this at the same time so we could take care of one another and spend time together. He has since tested negative."

Here's everyone at the White House Rose Garden SCOTUS event now called a likely 'superspreader.' Help us ID them all.

Barron was the most recent positive coronavirus diagnosis stemming from the White House.

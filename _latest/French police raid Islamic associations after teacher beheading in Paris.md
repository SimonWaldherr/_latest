<div><p>French police on Monday <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/gunman-shouts-allahu-akbar-before-beheading-man-in-paris/">raided Islamic associations</a> and probed foreigners suspected of holding extremist religious beliefs &#8212; three days after teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside his school in a Paris suburb.</p>
<p>Paty, 47, was murdered in broad daylight Friday by Abdoulakh Anzorov, 18, a Chechen refugee granted a 10-year residency in France this past March.</p>
<p>Following the attack, Anzorov confronted responding cops with an air-gun rifle &#8212; and <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/gunman-shouts-allahu-akbar-before-beheading-man-in-paris/">shouted &#8220;Allahu Akbar,&#8221;</a> or &#8220;God is great&#8221; in Arabic &#8212; as the officers opened fire, killing him.</p>
<p>Anzorov sought to avenge Paty&#8217;s use of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in the nude during a class on freedom of expression for 13-year-olds. Muslims consider any depiction of the Prophet as blasphemous.</p>
<p>The cartoons in question were published by the magazine Charlie Hebdo, <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/01/07/police-say-shots-fired-at-french-satirical-paper/">which was attacked</a> by Muslim extremists in 2015 over the caricatures &#8212; leaving 12 people dead and prompting massive demonstrations at the time.</p>
<p>Public figures have called Friday&#8217;s killing an attack on the Republic and on French values.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said that he was determining whether to disband about 50 associations within the Muslim community, and that some 80 investigations were being conducted into online hate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Police operations have taken place and more will follow, concerning tens of individuals,&#8221; the minister told Europe 1.</p>
<p>A police source said Sunday that the country was preparing to deport 213 foreigners on a government watchlist, suspected of holding extremist beliefs &#8212; about 150 of whom are serving jail sentences.</p>

 
	<p>The deportations were already in the works before Friday&#8217;s attack, according to a security source.</p>
<p>In the 24 hours after Paty&#8217;s killing, 10 people were detained in connection to the attack.</p>
<p>Among them, according to prosecutors, was the father of a student at Paty&#8217;s school and another person on the radar of intelligence services, who allegedly used social media to campaign against the teacher.</p>
<p>The second person is identified by a judicial source as Moroccan-born Abdelhakim Sefriuoi, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Sefriuoi has been on the French intelligence services watchlist for more than 15 years, according to security sources, and has used social media to fight against what he calls &#8220;Islamaphobia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thousands <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/thousands-march-in-france-for-teacher-beheaded-by-islamist-extremist/">marched in Paris Sunday</a> in tribute to Paty, chanting &#8220;Je suis enseignant,&#8221; or &#8220;I am a teacher.&#8221;</p>

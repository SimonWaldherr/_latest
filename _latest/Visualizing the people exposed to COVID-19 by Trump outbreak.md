Since last week’s announcements that President Donald Trump and his adviser Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus, dozens who came into contact with them or their associates have also contracted the virus.

Many attended the Sept. 26 event at the White House Rose Garden where Trump announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. The function – which drew high-profile public officials, religious leaders, and other dignitaries – has been called a coronavirus "superspreader" by many health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

While that event was the likely genesis of thousands of potential exposures to the virus, some White House staffers and others in Trump’s orbit had COVID-19 earlier. Crede Bailey, head of the White House Security Office, fell ill ahead of the Rose Garden ceremony. Two other staffers tested positive as early as Sept. 16.

Since then, prominent members of U.S. leadership, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have been forced to quarantine.

The White House has failed to provide contact tracing for those who have tested positive, and has refused offers of help from disease management agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. USA TODAY and volunteer organizations are seeking to fill that void with their own efforts to identify attendees.

The following is a record of all of the individuals in Trump's sphere that we know to have contracted, or been exposed to COVID-19 since mid-September. Please note that this is a developing story, and the information here is subject to change.

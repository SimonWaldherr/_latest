Breyer and Elena Kagan, said the state&#8217;s policy discriminated against older and disabled voters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If those vulnerable voters wish to vote in person,&#8221; Justice Sotomayor wrote, &#8220;they must wait inside, for as long as it takes, in a crowd of fellow voters whom Alabama does not require to wear face coverings,&#8221; referring to masks that help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She quoted from the testimony of one of the plaintiffs, Howard Porter Jr., a Black man in his 70s with asthma and Parkinson&#8217;s disease, who recalled that his ancestors had died for the right to vote. &#8220;And while I don&#8217;t mind dying to vote,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re past that &#8212; we&#8217;re past that time.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Officials in some Alabama counties agreed, Justice Sotomayor wrote. &#8220;They are ready and willing to help vulnerable voters like Mr. Porter cast their ballots without unnecessarily risking infection from a deadly virus.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Alabama law neither provides for nor forbids curbside voting, and some counties have used it in previous elections. In the current one, John H. Merrill, Alabama&#8217;s secretary of state, a Republican, ordered county officials not to offer it.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Several older or disabled voters sued, saying that Mr. Merrill&#8217;s order violated the Constitution and the Americans With Disabilities Act in light of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/kallon-abdul-k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Abdul K.

Biden Jr. in Philadelphia on Wednesday, ridiculing President Trump for complaining about campaigning in Pennsylvania, contracting the coronavirus and hiding business dealings with China.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We know that he continues to do business with China because he has a secret Chinese bank account. How is that possible?&#8221; Mr. Obama asked a crowd of supporters invited to hear him speak in the parking lot of South Philadelphia Sports Complex.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He was referring to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/trump-taxes-china.html?smid=tw-share" title="">New York Times report</a> that revealed previously unknown financial holdings in China &#8212; at a time when the president is criticizing Mr. Biden for ties to that country.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Can you imagine if I had a secret Chinese bank account?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Can you imagine if I had secret Chinese bank account when I was running for re-election?&#8221; His voice straining, he added, &#8220;They would&#8217;ve called me Beijing Barry.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It is &#8220;not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, adding that he had probably paid more in taxes working a high school job at an ice-cream parlor than Mr. Trump paid during each of his first two years as president &#8212; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/trump-750-taxes.html" title="">$750</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama&#8217;s long-anticipated speech, the first of several he intends to deliver on behalf of the Biden-Harris ticket over the next two weeks, marked a reversal of his initial reluctance to engage Mr. Trump directly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And even though his remarks, interrupted from time to time by the honking of horns at the drive-in rally, had moments of his signature soaring rhetoric, he seemed to divert somewhat from the kindler-gentler 2016 mantra inspired by his wife, &#8220;When they go low, we go high.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;By the way, his TV ratings are down,&#8221; the former president said. &#8220;So you know that upsets him. But the thing is, this is not a reality show. This is reality. And the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama, who has helped raise millions for his former vice president online but has not appeared in person at campaign events during the coronavirus pandemic, slammed Mr. Trump&#8217;s failure to contain the outbreak in more personal terms than he has used before.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Eight months into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Donald Trump isn&#8217;t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can&#8217;t even take the basic steps to protect himself.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama, who set aside his lofty campaign style in a go-for-the-jugular moment, seized on a misstep, recalling that Mr. Trump told supporters on Tuesday at a rally in western Pennsylvania that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/us/trump-biden-election/trump-says-before-coronavirus-he-never-planned-on-campaigning-in-erie-pa-we-had-this-thing-won" title="">he would not have visited them</a> if his campaign had not been struggling.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The president spent some time in Erie last night and apparently he complained about having to travel here,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, laughing. &#8220;Then he cut the event short. Poor guy. I don&#8217;t feel that way. I love coming to Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Philadelphia in August, for the virtual Democratic National Convention, Mr. Obama delivered a televised speech that cast the election as an existential battle for the future of American democracy. He struck those same themes in his return visit on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He said that Mr. Trump&#8217;s antics were unacceptable and wouldn&#8217;t be tolerated if the person were a school principal, coach or even a family member.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Why would we expect and accept this from the president of the United States?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He warned Democrats not to let up because of the polling advantage Mr. Biden is now seeing and said that some had become &#8220;lazy&#8221; in 2016. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care about the poll,&#8221; Mr. Obama said, referring to Hillary Clinton&#8217;s polling lead. &#8220;There were a whole bunch of polls last time. It didn&#8217;t work out.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to out hustle the other side,&#8221; he added, as the Democratic horns began to honk in unison.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Obama is scheduled to hold his next event on Saturday in Miami, followed by another rally in Orlando next week, according to a Democratic official with knowledge of his plans.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Neil Vigdor</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="iran-used-voter-data-to-send-threatening-emails-fbi-says"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#iran-used-voter-data-to-send-threatening-emails-fbi-says">Iran used voter data to send threatening emails, F.B.I. says.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, on Capitol Hill in May." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/21elections-briefing-fbi-emails4/merlin_172204521_3d201324-3742-4abd-b0eb-2168036e8c27-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, on Capitol Hill in May.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Pool photo by Gabriella Demczuk</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">WASHINGTON &#8212; Iran and Russia have both obtained American voter registration data, and Tehran used it to send threatening, faked emails to voters that were aimed at influencing the presidential election, top national security officials announced on Wednesday evening.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There was no indication that any election result tallies were changed or that information about who is registered to vote was altered, both of which would threaten to change actual votes, said John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, in an appearance at the bureau&#8217;s headquarters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And it was not clear that either nation hacked into voter registration systems. Some voter information, including party registration, is public, and voters&#8217; names may have been merged with other identifying material like email addresses that is available in other databases, according to intelligence officials, including some sold by criminal hacking networks on the &#8220;dark web.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, the announcement that a foreign adversary, Iran, had tried to influence the election by sending intimidating emails was a stark warning. Some of the faked emails, sent to Democratic voters, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/florida-alaska-trump-emails.html" title="">purported to be</a> from pro-Trump far-right groups, including the Proud Boys.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was not clear what Iran&#8217;s intentions were. Mr. Ratcliffe said the effort was aimed at hurting President Trump, and intelligence officials have said Iran opposes the president&#8217;s re-election. But if the emails had the effect of intimidating Democrats, they could also have hurt Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,&#8221; Mr. Ratcliffe said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He also said Iran was circulating a video that was pushing disinformation about fraudulent ballots being cast overseas.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julian-barnes" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Julian Barnes</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-e-sanger" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="trump-in-north-carolina-all-you-hear-is-covid-covid-covid-covid-covid"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#trump-in-north-carolina-all-you-hear-is-covid-covid-covid-covid-covid">Trump in North Carolina: &#8216;All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid.&#8217;</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump complained about the news media&#8217;s intensive coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday evening, describing the disease as an annoying inconvenience even as the country&#8217;s case count and death toll continue to soar.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Attacking two television networks, CNN and MSNBC, with barbed epithets, Mr. Trump insisted for the second night in a row, &#8220;That pandemic is rounding the corner. They hate it when I say it.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,&#8221; Mr. Trump said, repeating the word 11 times. &#8220;That&#8217;s all they put on, because they want to scare the hell out of everyone.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump&#8217;s lament about television news followed a familiar line in his recent speeches, insisting in defiance of all evidence that the coronavirus is rapidly disappearing as an issue. It is not a perspective shared by most voters: A national poll published Monday by The Times found that 51 percent of likely voters believed the worst of the pandemic was yet to come, compared with 37 percent who said the worst was over.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">And that was not the full extent of Mr. Trump&#8217;s dissembling on the pandemic. He repeated a familiar &#8212; and false &#8212; line claiming that the country only appears to have so many cases because there is so much testing, and telling supporters that his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was seeking to &#8220;prolong the pandemic&#8221; and &#8220;shut down your country,&#8221; even though the former vice president has presented a public-health agenda aimed at doing the opposite.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president also continued taunting Democratic governors who have imposed restrictions on gatherings and commercial activity to counter the spread of the virus, including North Carolina&#8217;s Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat seeking re-election whose popularity has risen in response to his handling of the pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You got to get your governor to open up your state here,&#8221; Mr. Trump said, prodding Mr. Cooper. &#8220;Open up your state, governor. It&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Mr. Trump also went out of his way to poke at a governor outside the region, once again attacking Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who was recently targeted by right-wing militants in a kidnapping plot.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also reiterated a call for the jailing of one of his political opponents, a demand he has made often in his political career and with new frequency toward the end of this campaign. His adversary this time was U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, whom Mr. Trump derided for raising the issue of foreign disinformation that targeted Mr. Biden. &#8220;Honestly, that guy should be locked up,&#8221; Mr. Trump said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As he swerved from one topic to the next, Mr. Trump occasionally delivered some elements of a conventional political message, promising &#8220;record prosperity&#8221; in a second term and accusing Mr. Biden of plotting with leftists to raise taxes.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Yet as usual, it was in his digressions that Mr. Trump showed real passion, including in interludes spent going after &#8220;the Deep Staters,&#8221; former President Barack Obama &#8212; whom he referred to using his middle name, Hussein &#8212; and the CBS newsmagazine show &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; with which Mr. Trump has been feuding.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Describing an interview that he abruptly ended Tuesday week, but which has not yet been broadcast, Mr. Trump claimed that the interviewer, Lesley Stahl, had described him as &#8220;begging for women to love you,&#8221; a characterization to which he objected.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You&#8217;ll see. You&#8217;ll see,&#8221; Mr. Trump said, seemingly forecasting some kind of payback, &#8220;We have a little surprise for &#8216;60 Minutes.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Also on Wednesday night, the Sinclair Broadcast Group aired an hourlong town hall with Mr. Trump recorded at the White House a day earlier. Speaking in the Rose Garden with the Sinclair host Eric Bolling and fielding friendly questions from several voters, Mr. Trump boasted that he had been doing a &#8220;flawless&#8221; job before the coronavirus hit and branded Mr. Biden as &#8220;corrupt.&#8221; If he is re-elected, he vowed, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to finish it strong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alexander-burns" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="giuliani-borat"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#giuliani-borat">Giuliani denies he did anything wrong in the new &#8216;Borat&#8217; movie.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Sacha Baron Cohen, left, features former New York Mayor Rudolph W.

Biden Jr.&#8217;s son, Hunter Biden.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;The Borat video is a complete fabrication,&#8221; Mr. Giuliani, 76, tweeted after he got off the air. &#8220;At no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate. If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I called the police,&#8221; he said in a brief text exchange on Wednesday. &#8220;He and all his crew ran away leaving their equipment behind.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still photos and descriptions of the scene from those who have screened the movie say the heavily edited clip, in line with the actor&#8217;s signature mockumentary format, begins with Mr. Giuliani, seated on a couch answering questions. Soon after, the actress, who speaks with a heavy Eastern European accent, asks the former mayor if they can continue their discussion in the bedroom. Mr. Giuliani agrees, and is then shown sitting on a bed, as she appears to take his microphone off and he appears to pat her.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The segment then cuts to the image of Mr. Giuliani, reclining on the bed, placing his hands down the front of his pants.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I had to take off the electronic equipment,&#8221; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMGqi76ihb4&amp;feature=emb_logo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Giuliani told the hosts of the &#8220;Curtis &amp; Juliet Show.</a>&#8221; &#8220;And when the electronic equipment came off, some of it was in the back and my shirt came a little out, although my clothes were entirely on. I leaned back, and I tucked my shirt in, and at that point, at that point, they have this picture they take which looks doctored, but in any event, I&#8217;m tucking my shirt in. I assure you that&#8217;s all I was doing.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The scene ends with Mr. Cohen, dressed in an outlandish pink costume, bursting in to the room and shouting that the woman, played by the actor <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7210025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Bakalova</a>, was 15 years old (the actor is 24, according to the IMDb).</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Cohen was frightened by his call to the police, bolted away and left him talking with the filmmaker&#8217;s lawyer.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The former mayor is not the first Republican politician to be ensnared in one of Mr. Cohen&#8217;s cringe-inducing pranks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In 2018, Mr. Cohen tricked the former G.O.P. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama into giving him an interview for the Showtime satire show &#8220;Who Is America?&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Later in 2018, a Republican lawmaker in Georgia <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/arts/television/jason-spencer-sacha-baron-cohen.html" title="">resigned after he was fooled into repeatedly yelling a racial epithet on Mr. Cohen&#8217;s Showtime series</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, accused Mr. Cohen of pretending to be a disabled veteran to land an interview with her, which she said was part of his repeated attempts to humiliate and &#8220;devalue&#8221; middle-class Americans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;He&#8217;s got a lot of people &#8212; Newt Gingrich,&#8221; added Mr. Giuliani, who insisted he was not taken in by Mr. Cohen. &#8220;He got Donald Trump before he was president.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Cohen&#8217;s new movie, &#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,&#8221; is scheduled to be released on Friday on Amazon Prime.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Glenn Thrush</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="quinnipiac-polls-show-a-biden-lead-in-pennsylvania-and-a-tight-race-in-texas"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#quinnipiac-polls-show-a-biden-lead-in-pennsylvania-and-a-tight-race-in-texas">Quinnipiac polls show a Biden lead in Pennsylvania and a tight race in Texas.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Senator John Cornyn,&#160;Republican  of Texas,&#160; on Capitol Hill Tuesday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/multimedia/21elections-briefing-Cornyn/merlin_178813632_378db12d-831b-4cb3-a39c-5ce671c381f0-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Senator John Cornyn,&#160;Republican  of Texas,&#160; on Capitol Hill Tuesday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Two polls were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://poll.qu.edu/pennsylvania/release-detail?ReleaseID=3680" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University</a>, showing a solid lead for Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Pennsylvania and a tight race in Texas.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Pennsylvania, Mr. Biden led President Trump 51 percent to 43 percent, with a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points. Hoping to help solidify that lead, former President Barack Obama made his first live appearance on the campaign trail in Philadelphia Wednesday at a drive-in rally in support of Mr. Biden.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In Texas, Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump were tied at 47 percent each, with a margin of 2.9 percentage points. Support for Mr. Trump in the reliably red state has dropped by 3 percentage points since last month, and Mr. Biden saw a bump of 2 percentage points.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The results were fairly similar to polling averages, which show Mr. Biden leading by about six points in Pennsylvania and Mr. Trump leading by about one point in Texas. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania by seven-tenths of a percentage point and Texas by nine points.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Quinnipiac also polled the race between Senator John Cornyn, a Republican of Texas, and his Democratic opponent, M.J. Hegar, and found Mr. Cornyn leading 49 percent to 43 percent. The seat is on Democrats&#8217; wish list, but is not one of the party&#8217;s main targets in its effort to retake control of the Senate.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The poll interviewed 1,241 likely voters in Pennsylvania and 1,145 in Texas by phone from Oct. 16 to 19.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-astor" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="senate-judiciary-democrats-plan-to-boycott-a-thursday-vote-to-send-barretts-nomination-forward"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#senate-judiciary-democrats-plan-to-boycott-a-thursday-vote-to-send-barretts-nomination-forward">Senate Judiciary Democrats plan to boycott a Thursday vote to send Barrett&#8217;s nomination forward.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump&#8217;s nominee for the&#160; Supreme Court, is expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but Democrats might not be there." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/us/21election-briefing-barrett/merlin_178837371_40f8ff48-bf1a-4531-93cf-1b7e9a44b8f3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump&#8217;s nominee for the&#160; Supreme Court, is expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but Democrats might not be there.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats plan to boycott a Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Thursday to approve the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, in a symbolic move intended to protest Republicans&#8217; push to confirm President Trump&#8217;s nominee before Election Day.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Around the time that the committee convenes, Democrats intend to gather instead on the steps of the Capitol for a news conference spotlighting their opposition to Judge Barrett and an extraordinarily swift confirmation process they say has been deeply unfair.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Left in their places in the hearing room will be large posters of Americans whose health care coverage they argue could evaporate in the event Judge Barrett sides with a conservative majority next month when the Supreme Court hears a Republican challenge to the Affordable Care Act.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Throughout the hearings last week, committee Democrats demonstrated the damage a Justice Barrett would do &#8212; to health care, reproductive freedoms, the ability to vote and other core rights that Americans cherish,&#8221; Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement on Wednesday. &#8220;We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just 12 days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Three Democratic aides who discussed the plans cautioned on Wednesday that they were still subject to change.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats have sharply opposed Judge Barrett, a conservative in the mold of former Justice Antonin Scalia, on policy grounds. But their goal on Thursday was to tarnish the legitimacy of her confirmation, arguing that Republicans have no right to fill the seat vacated by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg when millions of Americans are already voting.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Democrats are particularly angry that Republicans have reversed themselves since 2016, when they refused to consider President Barack Obama&#8217;s Supreme Court nominee because the election was only nine months away.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Republicans intend to proceed anyway, even if it means tossing out Judiciary Committee rules that require members of the minority party to be present to conduct official business. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and the chairman of the committee, argued this week that broader Senate rules only require a simple majority of all committee members present.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Republicans on the panel have the votes to recommend Judge Barrett&#8217;s confirmation to the full Senate, and are expected to do so unanimously.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Judge Barrett deserves a vote and she will receive a vote,&#8221; Mr. Graham said. &#8220;Judge Barrett deserves to be reported out of committee and she will be reported out of committee. Judge Barrett deserves to be on the Supreme Court and she will be confirmed.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has indicated that after the committee&#8217;s action, the Senate will proceed on Friday to bring up Judge Barrett&#8217;s nomination, with a final vote on Monday.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-struggling-bar-owner-in-a-biden-ad-also-happened-to-be-an-angel-investor-the-ad-disappeared"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-struggling-bar-owner-in-a-biden-ad-also-happened-to-be-an-angel-investor-the-ad-disappeared">A struggling bar owner in a Biden ad also happened to be an &#8216;angel investor.&#8217; The ad disappeared.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Joe Malcoun, who owns the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor, Mich., appeared in an ad for Joseph R.

It is shameful.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It was not immediately clear if the Biden campaign knew of the bar owner&#8217;s background or not. A Trump campaign spokesman seized on the oversight.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;In their desperation to pin something else on the president, they fabricated a story in a last-ditch effort to lie to voters because nothing else has worked &#8212; and they got caught,&#8221; the spokesman, Ken Farnaso, said in an email on Wednesday night.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Malcoun, owns the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor, Mich., a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.blindpigmusic.com/history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">magnet for musicians for 50 years</a>, attracting acts from Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon to Pearl Jam and Nirvana.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There were cutaways in the ad to an idle microphone, bar stools turned upside down and beer taps gone dry.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Right now, it&#8217;s an empty room,&#8221; Mr. Malcoun said in the ad. &#8220;This is the reality of Trump&#8217;s Covid response.

Biden Jr. and President Trump will meet for their final debate on Thursday in Nashville. The Plexiglass dividers &#8212; described by campaign aides as seven feet tall and four feet wide &#8212; are a safety measure intended to help prevent any aerial transmission of the coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But their debut at the vice-presidential debate did not exactly merit good reviews.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Experts in airborne viruses called the plastic barriers basically useless, saying that an air filter and a box fan would be far more effective. Aides to Mike Pence called for the vice president to be allowed to debate without dividers nearby, saying there was no justification for it. (Mr. Pence&#8217;s team ultimately acquiesced.)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Commission on Presidential Debates has not yet announced any specific medical precautions ahead of Thursday&#8217;s debate, such as requiring Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump to submit to independent tests for the virus. At the first debate in Cleveland, each campaign was allowed to test its own candidate on the honor system; two days later, Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The president has been highly critical of the debate commission&#8217;s handling of Thursday&#8217;s matchup.

<p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Barack Obama carried Iowa twice, but the state swung decisively to Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/iowa" title="">in 2016</a>. But as in other Midwestern states, Mr. Trump&#8217;s incendiary conduct has alienated many voters. The president is viewed unfavorably by more than half of likely Iowa voters, and very unfavorably by over half of women and college-educated voters there.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Another survey of Iowa, released Wednesday by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_IA_102120/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monmouth University</a>, found Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump by 50 to 47 percent among likely voters there. Mr. Biden&#8217;s edge, which is within the poll&#8217;s margin of error, was calculated using a high-turnout scenario that most observers say is already playing out in early voting and absentee balloting.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">It also represents a dramatic shift in just the last month: In September, Monmouth found Mr. Trump leading by a 49-to-46 percent margin using the same voter model.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Monmouth poll found Ms. Greenfield narrowly leading Ms. Ernst, by a 49-to-47 percent margin, which was also within the poll&#8217;s 4.4 percent margin of error.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-martin" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Jonathan Martin</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="a-man-in-maryland-was-arrested-and-charged-with-threatening-to-kidnap-and-kill-biden-and-harris"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#a-man-in-maryland-was-arrested-and-charged-with-threatening-to-kidnap-and-kill-biden-and-harris">A man in Maryland was arrested and charged with threatening to kidnap and kill Biden and Harris.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A man in Maryland was accused on Wednesday of threatening the lives of Joseph R.

Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A criminal complaint filed by the Secret Service on Wednesday did not describe any steps taken by the man, identified as James Dale Reed, to carry out the alleged threat. It said that on Oct. 4, Mr. Reed approached a house in his hometown, Frederick, Md., northwest of Washington, that had Biden-Harris campaign signs in the yard and left a handwritten note that contained graphic threats against the candidates and their supporters.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The resident&#8217;s video doorbell had captured an image of the man who left the note, the complaint said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We are the ones with these scary guns, we are the ones your children have nightmares about,&#8221; the note read in part. Mr. Reed, 42, was arrested last Friday and is being held without bond in Frederick County, Md., according to court records. A spokeswoman for the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, which is representing Mr. Reed, declined to comment.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He provided a palm print and handwriting sample and acknowledged having written the letter, according to the complaint. He is charged with the federal offense of threatening a major candidate, which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, and two violations of state law: threatening mass violence and voter intimidation.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The complaint said that Mr. Reed was known to law enforcement for making a complaint against a person under Secret Service protection in 2014.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Death threats against the United States president and presidential candidates are not uncommon in election years.

Noting that Mr. Trump has never delivered on regular promises to unveil a comprehensive health care plan to replace Obamacare, which he has worked to eliminate, Twitter users shared memes in which the book was variously filled with hundreds of blank pages, the names of people who had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1318673998671204353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1318673998671204353%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_1&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fkayleigh-mcenany-lesley-stahl-big-book-trump-health-care_n_5f8f6799c5b695a32fae5345" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost health insurance</a> under Mr. Trump&#8217;s presidency, or even <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/donmoyn/status/1318680476668858368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obituaries</a> for some of the more than 200,000 Americans who have died from coronavirus.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Not so, Ms. McEnany said in an email.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;It was a very large book of everything President Trump has signed &#8212; executive orders and legislation &#8212; to improve health care for Americans over the past three and a half years,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;All of these items are public, just compiled in one place in this book.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump grew irritated with Ms. Stahl&#8217;s questions during a 45-minute sit-down with her at the White House on Tuesday. According to people familiar with the exchange, the president refused to participate in a subsequent &#8220;walk-and-talk&#8221; that had been planned with Ms. Stahl and Vice President Mike Pence. He later tweeted a short video clip showing Ms. Stahl in the White House without a mask.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1318980039388561410/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Wednesday several photographs of Ms. Stahl speaking to him on camera, providing no commentary and thus leaving their point unclear &#8212; but perhaps suggesting he is ready to make good on a threat he tweeted on Tuesday to release White House video of their interview before &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; airs on CBS Sunday. The interview with the president is scheduled to be broadcast Sunday, and will also feature an interview with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senator Kamala Harris and Mr. Pence were also interviewed for the broadcast. Norah O&#8217;Donnell spoke with Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;You have to watch what we do to &#8216;60 Minutes,&#8217;&#8221; Trump told supporters in Erie, Pa., on Tuesday night. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get such a kick out of it.

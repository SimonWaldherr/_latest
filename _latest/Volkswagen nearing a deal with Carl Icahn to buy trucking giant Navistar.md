<div><p>Volkswagen has been locked in a staring contest with Carl Icahn &#8212; and the billionaire is blinking.</p>
<p>Navistar &#8212; the maker of the International brand of big-rig trucks whose big shareholders include Icahn and his former prot&#233;g&#233; Mark Rachesky &#8212; reached a deal in principle Friday to sell itself to Volkswagen&#8217;s truck-making subsidiary Traton for $44.50 a share, which values the company at about $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s up slightly from the $43 a share that Traton offered last month after it sweetened an earlier bid for $35 a share. But the $44.50-a-share offer is well short <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/04/carl-icahn-mark-rachesky-in-navistar-boardroom-battle/">of the $50 a share that Icahn wanted</a>, according to sources close to the talks. Rachesky, as The Post has previously reported, had once been seeking significantly more.</p>
<p>The haggling came to a head this week when Traton sent a letter to Navistar saying its $43-a-share offer represented its &#8220;best and final.&#8221; </p>
<p>Traton, a large Navistar investor that controls two board seats, said it would walk off the lot at 6 p.m. Friday unless Navistar agreed in writing to proceed with a deal at that price.</p>
<p>Traton&#8217;s hard-knuckle announcement sent Navistar&#8217;s shares tumbling 20 percent on Wednesday, bringing &#173;Icahn and Rachesky to their knees.</p>
<p>Navistar and Traton on Friday said Traton will buy the Navistar stock it doesn&#8217;t already own for $44.50 a share, subject to due diligence and final approval from both the board and shareholders. Navistar&#8217;s shares closed up 22.8 percent, or $8.10 a share, to $43.52. </p>
<p>The handshake agreement ends four years of on-and-off talks between the two truck makers. Volkswagen&#8217;s Traton is seen as the only natural buyer for Navistar because it is the only leading global truck maker that does not already have a US operation, which it sorely wants.</p>
<p>Navistar&#8217;s International line has a roughly 14 percent share of the US truck market, which will allow Traton to compete with Daimler-Chrysler&#8217;s Freightliner trucks and Volvo&#8217;s Mack trucks without the expense of building its own operations from the ground up.</p>
<p>Icahn and Rachesky will make money on the deal, although not nearly as much as they likely hoped when buying into Navistar shares roughly eight years ago.</p>
<p>Icahn bought into Navistar in 2011 when its stock was around $35 a share, and Rachesky in 2012 when the shares were in the mid-20s. </p>
<p>Since Sept. 2011, when &#173;Icahn announced he had been buying Navistar shares, the stock has risen 28 percent. The S&amp;P 500 in that same time period is up 179 percent.</p>
<p>Icahn&#8217;s other auto-sector investments have done worse, including this year when his roughly $2 billion investment in Hertz went up in smoke after the car-rental company filed for bankruptcy. The pandemic crushed Hertz&#8217;s sales, leaving it unable to pay its debts. </p>
<p>Icahn&#8217;s 20-year investment in Federal-Mogul has also taken a hit. In 2018 the billionaire helped sell the auto-parts maker to Tenneco in a $5.4 billion deal that left him with a 15 percent stake in the parent company.</p>

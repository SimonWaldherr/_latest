<div><p>Twitter held a Chris-off &#8212; and Chris Pratt proved the crowd&#8217;s least favorite contender.</p>
<p>On Saturday, screenwriter and television producer Amy Berg gave Twitter a challenge. &#8220;One has to go,&#8221; the Oakland-born showrunner wrote in a post with headshots of Chris Pratt, Pine, Hemsworth and Evans.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/bergopolis/status/1317583965520240640?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post has since gone viral</a>, racking up over 6,600 comments and 12,800 retweets.</p>
<p>Respondents overwhelmingly voted out &#8220;Parks and Recreation&#8221; actor Pratt, citing him reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/GwotThot/status/1317882467395768326" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">being a Trump supporter</a> and &#8212; in a claim Pratt, 41, has denied &#8212; last year <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/chris-pratt-responds-ellen-page-calling-his-church-anti-lgbtq-n970651" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supporting a church</a> which maintains anti-LGBTQ beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah he can go,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/biguyreviews/status/1317865350705278978" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responded</a> one non-fan of the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/22/chris-pratts-hot-new-bible-based-diet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proud Christian and Bible-based dieter</a>.</p>
<p>Others argued that all the Chrises look the same to them. &#8220;How to choose?&#8221; the competition critic <a href="https://twitter.com/Palle_Hoffstein/status/1317734436864200704" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> alongside four identical Friendly&#8217;s vanilla-flavored ice cream tubs.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all the same person!&#8221; more directly <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1317892495728992256" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> another.</p>
<p>Pratt found himself in hot water this month after encouraging fans to vote not in the upcoming presidential election but for his movie in this year&#8217;s People&#8217;s Choice Awards. &#8220;With all that&#8217;s going on in the world it is more important than ever that you vote,&#8221; he wrote in the Oct. 2 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CF1tC7opgEy/">Instagram post</a>. &#8220;Just ask any celebrity. They will tell you. Every day. Several times a day. To vote. But me? I will tell you EXACTLY who to vote for. #onward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;File Chris Pratt&#8217;s latest Instagram post as &#8216;Things You Can&#8217;t Believe Are Real, But Absolutely Are,&#8217; &#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/Lulamaybelle/status/1312078658622771200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote one critic</a> shocked by the perceived insensitivity of the post.</p>
<p>Berg followed the Chris-off post with <a href="https://twitter.com/bergopolis/status/1317585440614985728" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another Chris-based competition</a>, now featuring Irish comedian Chris O&#8217;Dowd in place of Pratt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like this is harder,&#8221; Blerg captioned the second Chris-off. Following the initial viral post, Berg has posted a number of other versions of the same-name celebrity Twitter battle format, including an <a href="https://twitter.com/bergopolis/status/1317700481259503617" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amy-off</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/bergopolis/status/1317695319983878144" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tom-off</a>, although neither have achieved nearly the same level of success.</p>

Wayne Rooney is reportedly in line to become manager of Derby County, with the Manchester United legend nearing taking over from Phillip Cocu as Rams boss, according to The Sun.

Under-fire Cocu is facing increasing pressure in the east midlands, with Derby having won just one of their opening four league games of the season and languishing in 20th in the Championship.

The Rams host Watford on Friday evening and a defeat could spell the end of the Dutchman's tenure at Pride Park, who is teetering on the verge of being sacked by the club.

Pressure is mounting on under-fire boss Phillip Cocu, with the Rams suffering a poor start

The Sun reports that the club's hierarchy would have sacked Cocu following a negative result against Norwich before the international break.

Ironically, though, Rooney's strike saved the 49-year-old from being axed but the pressure is still on for Cocu to turn the club's fortunes, and time is running out for him to do so.

Owner Mel Morris is believed to be willing to turn to former England captain Rooney if they lose to the Hornets on Friday.

The 34-year-old joined the club as player-coach last year but could make the step up

Manchester United's all-time record goalscorer is yet to receive his coaching badges, so will be in need of an experienced coach to form part of his backroom staff.

Former Rams boss John Gregory has been identified as the man to help an inexperienced Rooney if he is to take the helm in the dugout.

The 34-year-old joined Derby last year as a player-coach on an 18-month contract after returning from a stint with DC United in Major League Soccer.

Cocu replaced Frank Lampard as manager after the latter left for Chelsea in the summer of 2019. The Dutchman failed to get the club in the play offs last campaign.

<div><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.reptrak.com">RepTrak</a> and <a href="https://onclusive.com">Onclusive</a> are announcing a partnership that Onclusive CEO Dan Beltramo said will combine corporate reputation tracking and PR analytics for the first time.</p>
<p>RepTrak, founded in 2004, helps businesses measure their reputations (and their competitors&#8217; reputations) through a database of more than 1 million company ratings collected every year. Meanwhile, Onclusive (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/airpr-series-b/">formerly known as AirPR</a>) offers a variety of tools to analyze the impact of PR and earned media coverage on a company&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>Those two areas might not sound dramatically different, but Beltramo said that for PR professionals, they represent two separate goals &#8212; and that RepTrak&#8217;s reputation data helps to fill in some of the areas that Onclusive was missing.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>&#8220;We made our name in PR analytics, [measuring] what I would call bottom of the funnel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an important objective for PR: Are you driving sales? Are you driving downloads?&#8221;</p>
<p>By combining Onclusive&#8217;s data with RepTrak&#8217;s, Beltramo said they&#8217;re giving PR people &#8220;a good measure to shoot for at the top of the funnel&#8221; &#8212; and for some, improving reputation may be more important than driving sales: &#8220;At bigger companies with longer cycles and bigger issues, reputation is where the PR person&#8217;s psyche was focused.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conversely, he said that for a chief communications officer who&#8217;d previously paid more attention to high-level reputation, Onclusive&#8217;s provides more real-time data and tactical tools.</p>
<p>Beltramo added that there will be multiple stages to the partnership. First, the companies are working to present Onclusive&#8217;s media analytics in the RenTrak system. Eventually, information will be flowing in the opposite direction too, with Onclusive&#8217;s team figuring out how to incorporate RenTrak as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased that our partnership with Onclusive will give our clients an even more proactive way to activate their reputation management efforts by using the RepTrak Platform to prioritize and diagnose opportunities and threats, then drill into the details of their media presence to take action,&#8221; said RepTrak CEO Kylie Wright-Ford in a statement. &#8220;The media and cultural environments are very dynamic right now, so companies need to have a complete set of accurate data to make the right decisions.&#8221;</p>

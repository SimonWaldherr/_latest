  Millennials are the poster children for what happens when Congress fails to stimulate the economy - The Washington Post

  Massive state and local government layoffs, forestalled while officials held out hope for federal help, are likely to come soon.We’ve already seen what happens when officials reject aggressive fiscal interventions when they’re needed, or pivot prematurely to austerity.ADAnother recent paper looked specifically at the Great Recession, the subsequent anemic recovery and the “Lost Generation” that resulted.There was a surge in young adults moving back home during and immediately after the Great Recession.To be sure, some young adults are bunking with Mom and Dad because they wanted to escape dense cities during a lockdown, or because their dorms closed.

And the stereotypes of basement-dwelling are true: We&#8217;re more likely to still live with our parents.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">There was a surge in young adults moving back home during and immediately after the Great Recession. The trend was expected to reverse eventually but never did. Since the pandemic began, it has supercharged: For the first time since at least the Great Depression, most young adults now live with their parents, according to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/04/a-majority-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-live-with-their-parents-for-the-first-time-since-the-great-depression/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>.</p><p></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">To be sure, some young adults are bunking with Mom and Dad because they wanted to escape dense cities during a lockdown, or because their dorms closed.

I wanted to have kind of a senior role in my career.

It&#8217;s the result of a sharp economic contraction, followed by the federal government&#8217;s decision to withdraw fiscal support (including to states and cities) too soon, which let poor hiring conditions fester for longer than necessary.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In the years after the financial crisis, successive classes of unlucky students kept graduating into a stagnant job market.

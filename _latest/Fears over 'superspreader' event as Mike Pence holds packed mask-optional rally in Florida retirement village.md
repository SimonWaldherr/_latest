The first to arrive at Mike Pence’s rally in The Villages, Florida, took their places on the socially distanced chairs. When the seats filled up, the rally-goers - who had turned out in huge numbers to see the Vice President - crammed in together.

The supporters kept coming and coming on Saturday afternoon, and before long it was standing room only.

One older woman joked to her similarly aged friend: “there goes social distancing.” The few who were wearing masks were pulling them down to speak to each other and take licks of their ice cream.

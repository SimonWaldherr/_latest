For Manfred Abraham, the first plunge into lockdown came at an especially challenging time.

The boss of BrandCap was about to become a co-chief executive of a new consultancy, Yonder, as his firm and two others merged into a single business. “The official launch was going to be April 7,” recalls Abraham. “Getting into the first week of March we had planned a big internal launch party.”

Then lockdown came and the integration was paused before getting off the ground this month, pitching together teams where some people had never met their colleagues in person.

“We were originally thinking that we might run out of office space very soon. We’re not worried about that anymore,” says Abraham.

Support functions such as the finance team are unlikely to return to the office for more than a couple of days a week, he says. Firms as diverse as Microsoft and Schroders, the asset manager, have already told staff they will be able to work from home permanently. Companies are expected to reduce office space and cut costs.

Hybrid working

As lockdowns spread across the country this weekend, the more immediate puzzle is to adapt existing offices for an extended “hybrid” working world where some staff come to the office while others stay at home.

“People are starting to think about offices as places where we network and communicate and have workshops and things like that, not just sit in serried ranks of desks where we barely look up from our own computer screens,” says Peter Cheese, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Those who returned before the Government reintroduced its working from home guidance found their workplaces felt out of date.

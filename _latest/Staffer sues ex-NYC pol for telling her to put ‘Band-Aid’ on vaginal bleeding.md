An ex-staffer is suing disgraced former City Councilman Andy King for telling her to “put a Band-Aid on it,” when she asked to go to the emergency room for chronic vaginal bleeding, new court papers allege.

Antonia Ava Frampton-Shillingford says she suffers from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome which caused her excessive and painful bleeding for a month while she worked as King’s aide in August and September of 2017.

The 34-year-old says things came to a head on Sept. 2, 2017 when she asked King — who knew about her symptoms — to leave work early but he laughed and mocked her saying “Put a Band-Aid on it” forcing her “to work that entire day,” her new Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit claims.

Frampton-Shillingford says her doctor told her she didn’t need to take any time off from work and resolved the issue by changing her medication. But King forced her to go on unpaid medical leave for three months and “ignored [her] numerous requests to return to work” forcing her to eventually quit in January 2018, the court papers allege.

Before her leave began, she met King at his home to fight the forced break where he told her “the damage [had] already been done” and that he had to “put her out” because she had spoken to people in the office about her medical condition, the court documents claim.

King allegedly told her the leave “would serve as ‘a learning lesson’ for plaintiff to ‘keep her business to herself,” the suit says.

Frampton-Shillingford is suing King and the City Council for unspecified damages, unpaid wages and legal fees.

“When the man that is elected to lead and protect his residents chooses instead to use his power to intimidate, discriminate and commit unlawful acts upon them, a true injustice transpires,” plaintiff lawyer Sally Mourad said. “Former council member Andy King abused his position of power by engaging in hostile, derogatory and discriminatory conduct against my client based solely on the fact that she is a woman who suffers from a painful medical condition which is exclusive to women.”

“Andy King’s conduct was reprehensible and resulted in his expulsion from the Council,” a Law Department spokesman said. “We’ll review the case.”

King’s civil lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.

City Council declined to comment.

King was expelled earlier this month after three rounds of ethic charges in just two years were mounted against him for allegedly misusing government funds and mistreating his staff.

Frampton-Shillingford is not related to King’s wife, Neva Shillingford-King. The former lawmaker allegedly misused city resources to help her with her day job as a top executive at the SEIU Local 1199 labor union.

A special election to fill King’s seat has been set for Dec. 22.

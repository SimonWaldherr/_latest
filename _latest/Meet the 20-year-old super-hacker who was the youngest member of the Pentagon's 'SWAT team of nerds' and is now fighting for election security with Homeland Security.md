<p>Imagine this was the first presidential election in which you are old enough to vote. For four years &#8211; one-fifth of your life &#8211; you've heard about hacking, foreign interference, disinformation, and mistrust of the results.&#160;</p><p>And now it's your job &#8211; at age 20 &#8211; to help fix all that.</p><p>That's real life in autumn 2020 for Jack Cable, who is taking time off from his junior year at Stanford to work for the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as a technical advisor of election security. And if it seems strange that CISA would hire someone so young for that position, consider young Mr. Cable's robust resume:</p><p><a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/interview-with-hack-the-air-force-winner">He won the Air Force's first-ever hacker challenge</a> to find cybersecurity vulnerabilities at the agency &#8211; at age 17; he was named one of <a href="https://time.com/5463721/most-influential-teens-2018/">Time Magazine's 25 most influential teens</a> in 2018; he was the youngest member of the Pentagon's Defense Digital Service at 18; and he has identified <a href="https://hackerone.com/cablej?type=userv">over 300 cybersecurity vulnerabilities</a> in code from Google, Facebook, Uber, Yahoo, and other companies. And Chris Krebs, the director of CISA and the nation's top cybersecurity official says of him: "Jack will be successful wherever he goes and even if we only have Jack on board for a few years, his impact will be immeasurable."&#160;</p><p>You might think that as a Gen Z hacker, Cable would see tech innovation as the way to safeguard elections, but that's not the case: He actually advises putting down your phone and working things out with ink and paper.</p><p>"As convenient as it would be, for instance, to vote on our phones, the technology is not there yet to enable doing so securely," he says. "Instead, we need to focus on the basics to continue improving election security, like continuing to require auditable paper trails for ballots cast."</p><p>Public concern may be focused on the wrong areas of the election, he believes. "On the security side, what's gotten the most attention is voting machines," he says. But those are actually not a big target for hackers because "the vast majority of the time those aren't connected to the internet."&#160;</p><p>Instead, disinformation&#160;campaigns creating mistrust of the process is a bigger issue, he believes: "Ultimately what makes the election viable is people believing the results."</p>

<p>CISA, the federal agency Cable is working with on election security, is <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0717_cisa_foreign-influence-taxonomy.pdf">addressing disinformation and foreign interference</a> by working with the FBI to stop the hacking of websites and social media accounts, working with social media companies to address social media bots, and working with state and local election officials to report the amplification of false or inflammatory information.&#160;</p><p>CISA's chief, Krebs, is effusive in his praise for his young team member. "Jack is a great example of someone who is drawn to public service and the challenges we tackle here at CISA," Krebs says. I'm thankful to have Jack on the team, and the nation is better for it."</p><p>

</p><p>The election work is not the first government work of Cable's career. He was an 18-year-old member of Defense Digital Service, which the <a href="https://dds.mil/">Department of Defense describes on its website</a> as "a SWAT team of nerds established by the Secretary of Defense to provide the best in modern technology to bolster national defense."&#160;</p><p>Cable describes the group as "50 or so people now who run around trying to improve security at the Pentagon."&#160;</p><p>Cable says his government service has convinced him that "when it comes to cybersecurity, you can make changes in government that are of real value." For example, by creating audits to validate election results and boosting funding to test and improve the security of state and local electoral computer systems.</p><p>That doesn't mean he plans to stay in the public sector forever: He is a Stanford student, after all and said that launching his own startup is "definitely something to consider."</p><p>For now he is working for Uncle Sam from home in San Jose to help secure the elections, and voting in his first presidential election by mail.</p><p>On Tuesday, Cable is also appearing on a panel discussing election security at a virtual conference called <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/security-at">@Security</a>, which is hosted by HackerOne, a firm that connects companies with freelance researchers such as Cable, who search for cybersecurity "bugs" in return for cash prizes.&#160;</p>

Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Halls Image Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times; Emily Elconin for The New York Times President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. each held a televised town hall on Thursday night. Mr. Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics. Mr. Biden stuck closer to the facts.

Mr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate.

The president’s characterizations of the economy’s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate.

Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements.

A team of journalists from The New York Times fact-checked both candidates in their separate appearances, providing context and analysis.

By Health Reporter “We’ve done an amazing job. And it’s rounding the corner.” — Mr. Trump False. The United States is not “rounding the corner” when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past week, there have been an average of 53,120 cases per day, an increase of 23 percent from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database. As case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly below 20,000. “And now it’s kind of going back and forth between 40 and 50,000 cases a day,” Dr. Fauci said. “I have said many times, and I’ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.” Read more

By Politics Reporter “Before I came up here, I took another test. I’ve been taking them every day.” — Mr. Biden False. Mr. Biden tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday and again on Thursday, his campaign said before the town hall event. But his claim about being tested daily is inaccurate, based on the information his campaign has disclosed publicly. In the past, the Biden campaign declined to specify whether Mr. Biden was being tested daily for the coronavirus, saying only that he was being tested “regularly.” Early this month, after Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus, the Biden campaign said it would disclose the results of all of Mr. Biden’s tests. Since then, Mr. Biden has generally been tested every other day, based on the test results disclosed by the campaign.

By Fact-check Reporter “I have done more for the African-American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.” — Mr. Trump False. Not according to historians. Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act. A 2017 study that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top. Mr. Trump would place in the bottom third, the study’s co-author told The Times.

By Health Reporter “Just the other day they came out with a statement that 85 percent of the people that wear masks catch it.” — Mr. Trump False. Mr. Trump appears to be referring to a Sept. 10 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found dining out raised the risk of infection more than other social activities. The report went viral on social media, prompting the C.D.C. to write on Twitter that “the interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.” The C.D.C. followed 314 people who had coronavirus symptoms and sought testing during the month of July; about half tested positive. The study found that in the 14 days before the onset of illness, 71 percent of those who tested positive and 74 percent of those who did not reported always using a cloth face coverings or masks when in public.

By Economics Reporter “We had the greatest economy in the history of our country, last year.” — Mr. Trump False. Mr. Trump often says that his administration fostered the best economy in history before the onset of the pandemic. But data show that the economy in 2019 failed to measure up to prior economic eras across several dimensions. The expansion that stretched from 2009 through early 2020 was the longest on record, and it brought very low unemployment and improving wage gains. But many people remained on the job market’s sidelines: the employment rate for men in their prime, for instance, never rebounded to pre-2008 crisis levels. Output growth, which did receive a temporary boost from Mr. Trump’s tax cuts, has otherwise generally hovered around 2 percent. That is roughly the level economists see as sustainable given modern productivity and demographic trends, and lower than the run rate that prevailed in prior decades. And inequality remained very high. The top 1 percent held almost 40 percent of the nation’s wealth last year, little changed from 2016, based on Federal Reserve data.

By Politics Reporter “Moody’s, Wall Street, said I will create 18.6 million new jobs, good-paying jobs, No. 1. No. 2, the G.D.P. will grow by a trillion dollars more than it would under Trump.” — Mr. Biden True. Mr. Biden is referring to a report by Moody’s Analytics in September that analyzed the effects of the economic policies that Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump have proposed, depending on the outcome of the presidential election as well as House and Senate elections. Mr. Biden accurately cites the report’s findings, though it is worth noting the assumptions that go with those findings. Mr. Biden is referring to the best-case scenario for him, in which Democrats control all of government. In the scenario of a Democratic sweep, with Mr. Biden winning the presidency and Democrats controlling both the House and Senate, the report projected that the economy would create 18.6 million jobs during Mr. Biden’s term — 7.4 million more than under a scenario in which Mr. Trump wins and Republicans control both the House and Senate. With Mr. Biden as president and Democrats in full control of Congress, the analysis found that the nation’s real gross domestic product would be $960 billion larger at the end of the next president’s term than it would be if Mr. Trump won re-election and Republicans controlled both houses.

By Fact-check Reporter “I denounced white supremacy” during the first debate. — Mr. Trump This is misleading. Asked during the September presidential debate to condemn white supremacist and militia groups, Mr. Trump said “sure, I’m willing” but did not outright denounce them. “I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing,” he said as Mr. Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, pressed for a condemnation. Mr. Trump then asked for a specific group to denounce, to which Mr. Biden responded “Proud Boys.” “Proud Boys stand back and stand by,” he said, going on to add that “somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem.” Read more

By Fact-check Reporter “DACA is somewhat different than Dreamers, you understand that.” — Mr. Trump False. Mr. Trump is drawing an inconsequential distinction between the terms “DACA” and Dreamers. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created in 2012, protects about 700,000 young immigrants from deportation. Recipients under the program are known as “Dreamers,” named after legislation called the Dream Act. When Savannah Guthrie, the moderator of the town hall, noted that Mr. Trump had curtailed the program, he wrongly claimed his actions were because of the pandemic. The Trump administration announced in 2017 — long before the coronavirus was discovered — that the program would be phased out, but was blocked by the Supreme Court. The administration has not accepted new applications since 2017 and, in a memo after the Supreme Court decision, said it would allow recipients to renew their status under the program for only one year, rather than two.

By “I managed the Recovery Act, and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost of — the cost per B.T.U. of wind and solar. So, now, it’s cheaper than coal, it’s cheaper than oil right now.” — Mr. Biden Mostly True. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act contained $90 billion for the clean energy sector, including electric vehicles, public transit, energy efficient buildings and modernizing the electricity grid. Economists have widely credited the stimulus funding with driving down the costs of wind and solar energy and boosting its growth from less than 1 percent of energy production at the time to about 9 percent today. In some parts of the country, though not all, wind and solar electricity are as cheap or cheaper than coal or gas, though fossil fuel remains cheaper in parts of the country that do not have renewable energy facilities.

By Economics Reporter “People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.” — Mr. Trump This lacks evidence. It is true that people are leaving New York City temporarily amid the pandemic, but it is not yet clear what the city will look like in the months and years after the virus is brought under control. A recent report in Bloomberg, based on data from the U.S. Postal Service collected by the company MYMOVE, suggests that 110,000 people on net signaled that they were leaving Manhattan between February and July 2020. It remains unclear how many will remain out permanently.

By Mitch Smith and “The U.K. is up 2,500 percent, the E.U. is up 722 percent and the United States is down 21 percent.” — Mr. Trump This is misleading. It’s not clear what time frame Mr. Trump was using. But over the last two weeks, reports of new deaths have been mostly flat in the United States while they have increased by 128 percent in the United Kingdom. Still, on a per capita basis, recent deaths in the United States have remained higher than in the U.K. Mr. Trump may have been selectively comparing the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom to a low point in the United States. Deaths in the United States have fallen sharply from their peak this spring, though cases have recently started surging again. Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom fell to an average of seven per day at one point this summer, but have since been trending upward as the country struggles to control a growing outbreak.

<div><p>It looks like the Washington Football Team has decided on a name for next season: The Washington Football Team.</p>
<p>Though it originally was thought the &#8220;Washington Football Team&#8221; would be a one-season stopgap after the franchise ditched its controversial nickname in the summer, it now appears the organization will use the new moniker for at least another year.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a pretty good chance we will be the Washington Football Team next season,&#8221; team president Jason Wright told <a href="https://wjla.com/sports/washington-football-team/washington-football-team-president-no-fans-at-dallas-game-and-temporary-name-could-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington TV station WJLA</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On July 13, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/13/washington-redskins-officially-retire-name-logo/">team retired the name and logo</a> it used for 87 years following a review of the name Redskins which many considered as racist. The Washington Football Team name <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/23/the-washington-football-team-has-a-new-name-sort-of/">was announced July 23</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think next year is fast because of how the brand has to come together through uniforms, through approval processes through the league,&#8221; Wright said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could get there quicker, it&#8217;s actually pretty hard to get there that quickly because of all the steps that need to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Owner Daniel Snyder, who has owned the team since 1999, had long been opposed to changing the team&#8217;s name and vowed in 2013 to &#8220;never&#8221; change his view. He even fought all the way to the Supreme Court to protect the team&#8217;s original name.</p>
<p>Snyder was forced to change his tune after corporate sponsors <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/02/fedex-puts-heat-on-washington-redskins-to-change-team-name/">FedEx &#8212; which has its name on the stadium the team plays in &#8212;</a> Nike and PepsiCo put pressure on the team to axe the nickname.</p>

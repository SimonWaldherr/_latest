It’s spooky season, and Nike‘s latest Air Force 1 “Skeleton” is more than ready for the festivities. An autumnal Nike Sportswear staple that debuted in 2018 with a white/gray pair and continued in 2019 with a black/gray makeup, the Air Force 1 “Skeleton” has proved to be one of the Swoosh’s most popular in-line releases each October.

For its third go-around, the “Skeleton” discards the stark contrast of its past two iterations in favor of a jack-o’-lantern inspired orange leather base. Atop this bold build sits its signature detail: an x-ray inspired printed graphic of a foot’s bones, done up in black and gracing both lateral and medial sides. Black branded details like lace deubres and tongue tag/heel tab hits add a little extra contrast. If you look closely at the tongue tag, you’ll notice its Nike spellout is made of small bones as well.These detailed anatomy prints continue on the insoles, and the entire upper sits above a milky-colored midsole that glows brightly in the dark to complete the build.

The Nike Air Force 1 “Skeleton” in orange is set to release via Nike SNKRS on October 28, and is priced at $130 USD.

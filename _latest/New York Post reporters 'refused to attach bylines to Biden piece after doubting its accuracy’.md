They questioned the timing of the story - weeks before the election, a perfect "October surprise" - and whether enough fact checking had been done on the details. &#160;</p><p>Mr Giuliani openly admitted he chose to leak the story to the <i>New York Post</i> because he knew other outlets would spend too much time fact checking the information. &#160;</p><p>"Either nobody else would take [the story], or if they took it, they would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out," Mr Giuliani said. &#160;</p><p>The story asserts that during Mr Biden's tenure as vice president, he helped direct foreign policy decisions in Ukraine in a way that would help his son, Hunter Biden, who formerly sat on the board of <a href="/topic/ukrainian">Ukrainian</a> energy company <a href="/topic/burisma-holdings">Burisma Holdings</a>. &#160;</p><p></p><p>A Republican-led Senate committee that investigated Mr Biden's involvement with Ukrainian officials found no wrongdoing had occurred. &#160;</p><p>The paper's top editors allegedly pressured staff members to put their bylines on the story, but were unsuccessful in finding anyone willing to take responsibility. At least one other journalist other than Mr Golding refused to attach their name to the story. &#160;</p><p></p><p>Eventually, the story was published under the bylines of Emma-Jo Morris and Gabrielle Fonrouge. &#160;</p><p>The Times found that Ms Morris did not have a byline on the site prior to the publication of the Biden story. She is a deputy politics editor who formerly worked at Fox News. &#160;</p><p>The other reporter, Ms Fonrouge, apparently did not learn her name had been added to the story until after it was published. Reporters at the<i> New York Post</i> speaking to The Times said Ms Fonrouge had little to do with writing or reporting the story.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the <i>New York Post</i> said the paper stands by the story. &#160;</p><p>"The story was vetted and The Post stands by its reporting," she said. &#160;</p><p>The spokeswoman did not offer <i>The Times</i> a comment on how the story was written or edited.</p><p class="sc-ptCms fzKffT"></p></div>

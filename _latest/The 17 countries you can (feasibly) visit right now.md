The approved list of travel corridor countries, which Britons can visit without needing to self-isolate on their return, is shrinking.

In recent weeks, Iceland, Turkey, Poland, Slovakia, Denmark, Slovenia, mainland Portugal, Hungary, French Polynesia, Spain, France, Belgium, Croatia, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Andorra, Luxembourg, the Bahamas, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, Guadeloupe, Curacao, Bonaire and Aruba have all be removed from the green list, as have a clutch of Greek islands.

On the plus side, Sweden, Thailand, Singapore and Cuba have been added.

However, many of the countries on the green list (including Thailand and Singapore) are not yet welcoming UK tourists. Others have reintroduced restrictions due to rising cases in the UK. So where can you go?

In all, there are now just four places on the travel corridor list that have no restrictions on UK arrivals, and a further 13 with limited restrictions that make holidays feasible. Here is the full guide, as of October 8:

Open for business

Europe

1. Germany (With exceptions)

Germany recently added Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and large parts of northern England to its list of high-risk destinations. Arrivals from high-risk countries must take a test on arrival, something offered by most major German airports. If they test negative they are free to continue their holiday.

2. Gibraltar

Travellers must report to the authorities if they have been in a “relevant area” in the 14 days before their arrival in Gibraltar. Failure to do so constitutes an offence punishable with a fine of up to £1,000. A relevant area means a country, area or territory outside the European Union but does not include the United Kingdom, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man.

3. Greece (Partially open)

Travellers returning to Scotland from the whole of Greece must self-isolate.

For England and Northern Ireland, those returning from Lesvos, Tinos, Serifos, Mykonos, Crete, Santorini and Zakynthos must quarantine; for Wales, the exclusions are Mykonos, Zakynthos (Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos, Crete, Santorini, Serifos and Tinos.

You must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before your arrival in Greece. Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a fine on arrival, or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter the country.

4. Sweden

Feasible to visit

Europe

5. Cyprus: Test before departure

Cyprus has placed the UK in Category B: this means that tourists are permitted to travel, but they need to provide a negative Covid-19 test result on arrival, obtained no more than 72 hours before travel. Test results can be in the form of an email or SMS, but the result itself and/or appointment letter must include the date and time when the test was taken. Children under 12 years old do not require to be tested in order to travel to Cyprus. Please see the Republic of Cyprus Information Office website for further information. All travellers to Cyprus must complete a Cyprus Flight Pass before travelling, available on the Cyprus Flight Pass website. You will be responsible for ensuring your PCR test result is uploaded to Cyprus Flight Pass within 24 hours of your departure. More details here.

6. Faroe Islands: Test on arrival

All travellers to the Faroe Islands must be tested (at their own expense) for Covid-19 on arrival until at least October 31. A follow up test on the sixth day of the visit is strongly recommended. Children younger than 12 do not need to be tested.

7. Jersey: Test on arrival

Jersey requires UK arrivals to show evidence of a negative Covid test or take a test on arrival if they want to avoid a 14-day quarantine.

8. Italy (including Vatican City)

A negative Covid test, administered in the 72 hours before your travel, is required. Alternatively, you can get a free test on arrival at some airports, or at a testing facility in Italy shortly after you arrive. If you test positive within Italy, you will be required to quarantine.

You should download and complete a self-declaration from the Interior Ministry before you travel.

9. Madeira

Before you arrive you must complete and submit a traveller questionnaire between 12 and 48 hours before departure. If you have one, upload proof of a negative Covid-19 test, carried out 72 hours before departure.

On arrival, you will be subject to a health screening. If you have not uploaded your Covid-19 test result, you will be asked to show it at the airport. If you do not have proof of a test, you will be able to take one at the airport and self-isolate at your accommodation until the results are known. This will take about 12 hours.

10. San Marino

You must travel through Italy to reach San Marino. See “Italy”, above.

Caribbean

11. Anguilla: Test before departure

It may be open, but visitors to Anguilla have to jump through lots of hoops during their holiday.

Applications to enter, made via ivisitanguilla.com, must be updated with a negative PCR test taken three to five days before arrival. Thereafter all arrivals are tested upon arrival, and again, after ten days. During the first ten days holidaymakers are required to remain at their chosen accommodation, which can be either a private villa, hotel, or resort. Only after a second negative test can they move freely around Anguilla.

This process, however, doesn’t come cheap. Not only will visitors be required to provide an insurance policy covering medical expenses related to Covid-19, they’re also charged $1,000 (£770) per individual for a stay of less than three months. The fee covers testing, additional health staff required during your visit, and surveillance and security for the ports and accommodation. A family up to four will be charged $1,500 (£1,155) in total.

12. Antigua and Barbuda: Test before departure

All passengers 12 years and older arriving by air in Antigua and Barbuda, including those transiting the country, must provide evidence of a negative PCR test taken no more than seven days before arrival. Further health screening is in place at VC Bird International Airport and a further test on arrival may be required.

13. Barbados: Test before departure

All visitors must present evidence of a negative Covid test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. All arrivals from the UK must remain in an approved hotel (at their own expense), or a government facility free of charge, until they receive a second negative test result taken 2-3 days after arriving. Once they have the second all-clear, they are free to explore the island and leave the designated accommodation. They will also be asked to monitor their health and check-in with public health representatives via call or text.

14. Bermuda: Test before departure

All visitors from the UK will need to apply for Travel Authorisation and are required to have a pre-departure test.

15. Grenada: Test before departure

Grenada recently revised its entry restrictions, moving to a three-tier system of Caricom Travel Bubble; Low Risk Countries; All Other Countries. The UK currently sits in the ‘All Other Countries’ category (along with most European countries, Canada and the USA).

UK arrivals must show a negative PCR test taken within seven days of travel. They must spend the first four days at an approved accommodation for observation and quarantine (see here for a list of 58 approved properties) after which they can take a PCR test to be allowed into the community, or may remain at the hotel/resort/villa for the duration of their visit. Visitors must also download the approved Contact Tracing App prior to arrival; visitors without smartphones or unable to use the app may be required to wear a monitoring device; visitors must complete relevant paperwork upon arrival and may be interviewed by a health or immigration official. Check www.PureGrenada.com for updates.

Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic aim to restart direct flights to Grenada this month: BA from October 14 (departing London Gatwick, through St Lucia, on Saturday and Wednesday) and Virgin Atlantic from October 26 (departing London Heathrow, through Antigua, on Monday and Thursday).

16. St Lucia: Test before departure

Visitors must provide a negative test result taken no more than seven days previously. All arriving passengers will be screened, including temperature checks, at the airport. Any symptomatic passengers will be isolated and tested. Visitors must stay in an approved resort.

17. St Vincent and the Grenadines: Test before departure

All travellers must complete a pre-arrival questionnaire found at www.health.gov.vc. If you’re travelling from the UK, you must arrive with a negative result of a test done no more than five days before arrival. You will be retested on arrival in SVG and must quarantine for up to 72 hours at a government-approved hotel to await clearance.

Not feasible

Europe

Azores

The Azores would be feasible, except Ryanair has suspended flights for the winter. The only option is to fly via Portugal, which would breach quarantine rules.

Before you arrive you must complete and submit a traveller questionnaire between 12 and 48 hours before departure. If you have one, upload proof of a negative Covid-19 test, carried out 72 hours before departure.

On arrival, you will be subject to a health screening. If you have not uploaded your Covid-19 test result, you will be asked to show it at the airport. If you do not have proof of a test, you will be able to take one at the airport and self-isolate at your accommodation until the results are known. This will take about 12 hours.

Estonia

If you’re arriving in Estonia from the UK, you’ll need to self-isolate for 14 days. You have the option of taking a test to reduce your self-isolation period (not be available for children). Full details can be found on the Estonian Health Board website. Until the test results are known, one must be in complete self-isolation. In the case of a negative result, the person will be notified via text message; positive results will be communicated over the phone. In the case of a negative test result, the person must stay in limited self-isolation for the first seven days following arrival to Estonia, i.e. the person can go to work and, for example, a shop, but unnecessary contacts must be avoided. The person should also keep their distance from others while at work. A second test must be performed no earlier than seven days after the results of the first test, and if it is also negative, a person can resume their daily life.

Greenland

It is on the green list, but the only way to reach Greenland is via Iceland or Denmark, and both countries have lost their travel corridors in recent weeks.

Guernsey

Guernsey requires all arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days.

Ireland

All arrivals from overseas, including Irish residents, are asked to restrict their movement for 14 days on arrival. There are some exemptions, including if you are returning to Ireland from Northern Ireland or from any of the countries that are on the Irish Government’s Green List. The UK is not currently on the list.

Isle of Man

All arrivals must self-isolate for two weeks. Those caught breaking the rules have been handed prison sentences.

Latvia

UK arrivals are required to self-isolate for 10 days.

Liechtenstein

While Liechtenstein is on travel corridors list, it has no airport and its only land borders are with Austria and Switzerland – both of which are not. To reach it without needing to self-isolate on your return to Britain you will need to fly to a travel corridor country (such as Germany) and drive to Liechtenstein without leaving your vehicle to mix with anyone in a “red list” country. Furthermore, as of September 28, arrivals from the UK will need to quarantine for 10 days.

Lithuania

British nationals resident in the UK will need to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 PCR test on arrival in Lithuania and self-isolate for 14 days.

Norway

All travellers from the UK are required to quarantine for 10 days on arrival.

Caribbean

Cuba

Foreign tourists can visit Cuba on international charter flights into the following destinations only: Cayo Coco, Cayo Cruz or Cayo Guillermo (served by Jardines del Rey airport); Cayo Santa Maria (flying into Santa Clara airport), or Cayo Largo del Sur. However, there are currently no direct flights from the UK to Cuba, with the majority of options requiring a transfer in a non travel corridor country (such as Mexico). The Cuban government recently announced plans to permit flights to the beach resort of Varadero from Octover 15, however. This could make trips to the country from Britain possible.

Dominica

Arriving passengers must complete an online questionnaire 24 hours before arrival, and have a PCR swab test with a negative result taken up to 72 hours before arrival. A Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) will be taken on arrival. If the RDT is negative, then the traveller must self-isolate in a government operated or government certified facility for five days before having a further PCR test. If the RDT is positive, then a further PCR swab test will be carried out. This will be at the traveller’s expense.

St Barts

To enter the French Overseas Territories, the French government has confirmed you must complete a travel certificate. Visitors are subject to a health check upon arrival, which may result in a period of quarantine. However, the only direct flights are via France, which is not on the travel corridor list.

Americas/Atlantic

Falkland Islands

All arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days.

St Helena

All arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days.

St Pierre and Miquelon

Travel certificate required for entry; however, there is no way to reach the country from the UK without entering a non travel corridor country.

Asia/Oceania

New Caledonia

You must complete a travel certificate; however, there are no flight options from the UK

South Korea

All arrivals, regardless of nationality and length of stay, are required to be tested for coronavirus and to undergo quarantine for 14 days.

Closed to UK tourists

Europe

Finland

Finnish borders remain closed to non-resident foreign nationals entering the country, with some exemptions. From November 23, however, restrictions are being relaxed. VisitFinland.com explains: “Leisure travel will be possible from all EU and Schengen countries (including the UK) with infection rates above 25 per 100,000 persons [over the previous 14 days]. However, travellers from these countries will need to have proof on arrival in Finland of a negative Covid-19 test result no older than 72 hours. On arrival in Finland, visitors from these countries are placed in quarantine for 72 hours, after which they need to take a second test. After a second negative Covid-19 test result, the person can move around in Finland freely. If the visit to Finland lasts less than 72 hours, no quarantine or second test is required.”

Liverpool will wake up on Tuesday with a collective hangover. The city, whose economic revival in recent years has been underpinned by its vibrant nightlife, has been plunged into chaos and confusion after being singled out for a strict new Covid-19 lockdown by the Prime Minister.

The order, announced in the Commons by Boris Johnson after days of briefings, provoked a mixture of anger and distress on Liverpool's streets. The rules, subject to a vote in Parliament, will come into force at 5pm on Wednesday.

Pubs and bars – unless they serve "substantial meals" with drinks attached – will be forced to shut, along with gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos.

Travel in and out of Liverpool City region, which comprises 1.5 million people, is no longer advised unless for work or other essential activities. Even wedding receptions are now banned as Liverpool is placed under a partial lockdown as part of the Government's three-tier rules.

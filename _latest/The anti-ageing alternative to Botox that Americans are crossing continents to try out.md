It’s not often the UK gets to claim a non-surgical cosmetic procedure first over America, but in the case of Profhilo, a hyaluronic acid skin treatment, the Brits did.

While it waits to get full approval for use in the US, those in America who have heard of its effectiveness have reportedly been travelling to the UK to get their fix. And with good reason, for crucially Profhilo contains no BDDE (butanediol diglycidyl ether), a chemical found in most filler products on the US market, which is believed to be carcinogenic in high quantities.

Profhilo first arrived into the world of exclusive treatments four years ago after its development in Italy by a leading hyaluronic acid lab. Already used widely in dermal fillers, and liked by the industry for its long-lasting skin rejuvenation properties and moisture retention, hyaluronic acid can be manipulated to work in different ways.

According to its makers, the formula developed for Profhilo has the highest quantity of active agents ever in a skin treatment and is also a 'bio-remodeler', meaning it closely mimics and stimulates rejuvenating activity within skin cells.

However, it manages to do this via a chemical process which does not require BDDE. While harmless in the small quantities used in other fillers, no research as yet exists on the longterm effects of having a regular BDDE-containing filler injection three or four times a year, over a longer period of time.

Meanwhile, Profhilo continues to grow in fame and popularity. Cosmetic treatment connoisseur Meg Mathews praised it on her Instagram feed on September 1 as, “the way forward for a plump, hydrated look without that awful filler look.”

Adding that she no longer uses fillers, Mathews is part of a growing client group eager to try the new trend for injection treatments where multiple small jabs replace one or two deeper injections, or painful surface lasering, which requires a longer recovery time afterwards.

During a treatment, the practitioner administers Profhilo through a sequence of five small injections around the face. The defining difference between this procedure and a hyaluronic dermal filler is that the substance seeps through the skin closer to the surface, as the injections are smaller, rather than those used to fill deeper lines or boost chin volume or cheekbones.

“These new hyaluronic acid boosters remind me of the old days when we had collagen in the form of cosmoderm and zyderm, which essentially did the same thing but fell out of favour because the effects don’t last,” says top New York City cosmetic surgeon Dr Doris Day.

“If you injected some of the current products too superficially you may get bumps or a bluish tint due to the change of reflection of light as it passes through the skin but these newer products have a specific mix of cross-linked and free hyaluronic acid to allow for more superficial injections without those concerns, or at least less of a concern.”

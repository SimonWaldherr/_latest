But Musk knows he has to win the economic argument for electric cars as well as the environmental one. “I don’t think there will be an ICE [internal combustion engine] industry long term”, he said, confidently.

Musk has a history of grand promises but also missed deadlines, so it is perhaps not unreasonable to interpret his three year timeline as five.

Perhaps to reassure on this point, the company went into great technical depth about its battery work. Reaction to the event was, however, mixed.

Tesla shares fell 7pc in late trading, and after months of build-up, investors had possibly expected something more ambitious. If Musk can deliver on his promise of a $25,000 Tesla on schedule, they will probably forgive him.

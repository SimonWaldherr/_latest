It's not a such thing as a super champion, not at all. And I'm not taking nothing away from no fighter. It's too many belts.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sanctioning bodies usually take three per cent of a purse from the champion and challenger and the financial interest is at the heart of the problem.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Promoters, sanctioning bodies and fighters are always likely to prefer belts being on the line to ramp up the spectacle of a fight, despite the long-term damage it does to the image of the sport.&#160;&#160;</p><img id="i-f1c65d21cb2ff27b" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="438" width="634" alt="Mayweather was speaking ahead of Gervonta Davis' (right) fight with Leo Santa Cruz" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-f1c65d21cb2ff27b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/22/14/34708374-8868247-image-a-69_1603372140890.jpg" height="438" width="634" alt="Mayweather was speaking ahead of Gervonta Davis' (right) fight with Leo Santa Cruz" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Mayweather was speaking ahead of Gervonta Davis' (right) fight with Leo Santa Cruz</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mayweather went on to address this point: 'People don't know you have to pay, for every belt that you win, there's a sanctioning fee. So now, if a fighter wins an interim belt, he has to pay a sanctioning fee. If a fighter has just the regular belt, he has to pay a sanctioning fee. Then, if a fighter is a super champion, then he has to pay a sanctioning fee.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is not good for the sport of boxing. Now, when a fighter fights, every fighter is a champion now. Belts now is like a fighter winning an amateur trophy. Everybody is a champion. Everybody have a belt.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If there are four titles on the line for a fight, that would mean around 12 per cent of a purse could go to the sanctioning body, a significant amount.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One stat that illustrates the problem of mass champions is that the WBA recognises three or more champions in 12 of 17 weight divisions in the sport.&#160;</p><img id="i-83ad4755072a176b" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="422" width="634" alt="He accepted partial responsibility for the problem lies with Mayweather Promotions" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-83ad4755072a176b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/22/14/34707130-8868247-image-m-72_1603372266745.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="He accepted partial responsibility for the problem lies with Mayweather Promotions" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">He accepted partial responsibility for the problem lies with Mayweather Promotions</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Davis, who is represented by Mayweather, fights Santa Cruz, the WBA 135-pound title is on the line even though neither man is allowed to tip the scales for that weight limit next weekend.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Calling for change and exacting it are two very different propositions, even with Mayweather's influence.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no overarching authority that can order each sanctioning body to agree to terms and provide clarity for spectators.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boxing is also challenged by the rise of MMA where the primary promotion, the UFC, routinely pits the best against the best for one championship in one weight division.&#160;</p></div>

Proposition 14 ($5.5-billion general obligation bond for the state’s stem cell research institute)

— No

When California voters approved a stem-cell research initiative in 2004, the idea wasn’t to have the state replace the federal government’s funding for the long term. It was to kick-start an industry that would then operate on its own.

Proposition 15 (property tax “split roll” for commercial and industrial real estate)

— Yes

At long last, here is a fix for one of California’s most intractable problems: a wildly unfair and lopsided property tax system that has starved local governments of revenue and distorted the cost of buying a house and starting a business.

Proposition 16 (repeal of ban on affirmative action in state programs)

— Yes

Proposition 209, a ban on affirmative action programs in public institutions that voters adopted in 1996, has set back the state’s efforts to promote diversity. It’s past time to remove it.

Proposition 17 (restoring parolees’ right to vote)

— Yes

In California, felons who have served their time in prison are denied the right to vote until they finish their parole. That’s an obstacle they don’t need as they reintegrate into society.

Proposition 18 (right to vote in primaries for some 17-year-old Californians)

— Yes

It makes sense that the teens who will be 18 years old and eligible to vote in a general election in California should also help decide, when they are 17, whose names will be on that ballot.

Proposition 19 (transfer of property tax assessments when homes are sold)

— No

By letting older homeowners keep the property tax break they’ve built up when they move to a new home, Proposition 19 would extend inequality by benefiting those who were lucky enough to buy a home years ago and hold onto it as values skyrocketed.

Proposition 20 (criminal justice reform rollbacks)

— No

California is leading the nation away from decades of foolish and wasteful policies that prevent even low-level offenders from correcting their mistakes and getting on with productive and law-abiding lives. This is no time to reverse course.

Proposition 21 (rent control authority for local jurisdictions)

— Yes

Cities are on the front lines of managing the upheaval and suffering caused by the state’s housing crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. They need the flexibility to adopt policies in response, such as limits on rent increases or temporary rent freezes.

Proposition 22 (treating app drivers as independent contractors)

— No

California needs a better approach to gig workers. But rather than accepting the bad bargain Proposition 22 presents, voters should demand a better, broader answer from Sacramento.

Proposition 23 (dialysis clinic requirements)

— No

There’s no evidence that the measure would protect the health and safety of dialysis patients, but there’s plenty of evidence that it is being improperly used as a labor organizing tool.

Proposition 24 (consumer data privacy)

— Yes

The state’s groundbreaking data privacy law has come under attack in the Legislature. This measure would expand the protections for personal data and bar the Legislature from weakening them, while leaving the door open for improvements.

Proposition 25 (money bail referendum)

— Yes

This measure would ratify a law to end bail and the use of wealth or poverty in California to determine whether a person accused of a crime stays in jail or goes home before trial.

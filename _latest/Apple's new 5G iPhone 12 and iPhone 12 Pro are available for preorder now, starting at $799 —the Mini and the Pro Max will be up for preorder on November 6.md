Like the iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 has a dual camera and comes in an array of colors: This year's lineup is black, white, red, green, and blue.</p><p>But the new device differs from last year's model in a few key ways. While the iPhone 11 had the rounded design Apple had employed since the iPhone 6, the iPhone 12 has a sharper edge, similar to older iPhones like the iPhone 4 and the new iPad Pro. Apple said&#160;the iPhone 12 is 11% thinner and 16% lighter than the iPhone 11.</p><p>Unlike the iPhone 11, the new device will be 5G-enabled and have a 6.1-inch OLED display. (Last year's model had Apple's Liquid Retina display.) Apple said the iPhone 12 has four times better drop performance thanks to a new step in the glass-making process called ceramic shield.</p><p>The iPhone 12 will run on Apple's new A14 Bionic chip, which Apple said would&#160;provide increased performance with better energy efficiency.</p><p>While last year's iPhone had wireless charging, Apple added a way to make it easier with the iPhone 12: The phone will have MagSafe built in, meaning any MagSafe accessory will automatically snap to the back of the device.</p><p>The iPhone 12 starts at $799.

The device will come in silver, graphite, gold, and blue.</p><p>The Pro will have a 6.1-inch OLED display, Apple's new A14 Bionic chip, and a three-camera array with wide, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses.

  Mookie Betts’ big World Series night was a Red Sox nightmare

  Mookie Betts, whose stolen bases earned the country free Taco Bell, starred in the Dodgers’ 8-3 Game 1 World Series win over the Rays on Tuesday night.That, of course, came with the Fox broadcast discussing the stunning trade that sent Betts from Boston to Los Angeles and Twitter mocking the Red Sox for it.Here is a sampling of that mocking as the 28-year-old Betts, who helped the Red Sox win the World Series two season ago, went 2-for-4 with two stolen bases and a home run.The common response from portions of Red Sox Nation was that Betts had turned down long-term offers from Boston and had no intention of re-signing.The Red Sox sent Betts, along with David Price, to the Dodgers in February and in July the outfielder signed a 12-year, $365 million extension.

<div><p>The tacos won&#8217;t be quite as crunchy in Boston.</p>
<p>Mookie Betts, whose stolen bases earned the country free Taco Bell, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/dodgers-top-stars-deliver-in-rout-of-rays-in-game-1-of-world-series/">starred in the Dodgers&#8217; 8-3 Game 1 World Series win</a> over the Rays on Tuesday night. That, of course, came with the Fox broadcast discussing <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/02/04/red-sox-reportedly-trading-mookie-betts-david-price-to-dodgers/#:~:text=In%20a%20blockbuster%20trade%20Tuesday,The%20Post's%20Joel%20Sherman%20confirmed.">the stunning trade that sent Betts from Boston to Los Angeles</a> and Twitter mocking the Red Sox for it.</p>
<p>Here is a sampling of that mocking as the 28-year-old Betts, who helped the Red Sox win the World Series two season ago, went 2-for-4 with two stolen bases and a home run.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The common response from portions of Red Sox Nation was that Betts had turned down long-term offers from Boston and had no intention of re-signing. While Betts intended to test free agency, he had maintained that he loved playing in Boston and entering free agency did not mean he would necessarily be leaving the franchise.</p>
<p>The Red Sox sent Betts, along with David Price, to the Dodgers in February and in July <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/22/mookie-betts-closing-in-on-mega-contract-extension-with-dodgers/">the outfielder signed a 12-year, $365 million extension.</a></p>
<p>Price, who opted out of the season over coronavirus concerns, <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9ldE5zM1BwTg/episode/Y2U2ZjM5YzAtMDE5My0xMWViLTkzZjItZmI2YjcyZjkxZTIw?hl=en&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjw0K-u1sXsAhUol3IEHYsUBD4QjrkEegQIJhAF&amp;ep=6">was asked recently on Jayson Stark&#8217;s podcast</a> if this would be the Red Sox&#8217;s new Curse of the Bambino.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that. Mookie&#8217;s that good, period,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;That&#8217;s just not something you expect to happen with an organization like Boston. You expect a player like Mookie to be there forever. And that wasn&#8217;t the way it happened, and it wasn&#8217;t the way it happened with Babe Ruth. And it is remembered daily.&#8221;</p>

Well, I gave Emily in Paris a good go. After watching people tear it apart on Twitter, I couldn't resist any longer. Sure, the trailer made my skin crawl. But it was made by the Sex and the City guy! How bad can it be? The answer is: pretty bad. Sure it's frothy and fun(ish) and quite a good antidote to *gesticulates wildly* all this. But the Netflix show – which rolls out the well worn trope about a clueless American girl going to live in romantic Paris – would leave most people with a few questions. And if you've ever lived in Paris, it'll make you simultaneously desperate to go back and also furious with whoever decided to portray that glorious city with quite such a heavy dose of cliché.

There are many things about Emily in Paris which I just don't buy (the first being that she'd actually eat any of the delicious things put in front of her) but here are just a few things the show gets wrong.

1. You have to hustle for a pied-à-terre

An attractive estate agent is not simply going to meet your taxi from Charles de Gaulle, flirt with you and carry your suitcase up to a charmant but also inexplicably large garret apartment with views over the rooftops. “Oh my God I feel like Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge,” exclaims Emily upon opening the shutters in her “chambre de what now?”

Anyone who has ever tried to find somewhere to live in Paris knows you have to earn your rooftop view through blood, sweat and tears. In 2011, I finally found a flat after days spent pounding the streets, scouring the noticeboard at the American Church of Paris, and briefly getting locked in an apartment by a psychotic old man who wanted me to clean for him (and, I suspect, do other things) in exchange for his spare room.

  Excluding special items such as stock-based compensation, Tesla made 76 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates of 57 cents.At $394.5billion, Tesla's market capitalization is the largest among all automakers in the world, despite Tesla trailing rivals in terms of sales, revenue and profit.Tesla's ascent highlights investor confidence about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla's shift from niche carmaker to global leader in clean cars.But that revenue is expected to dry up as Tesla's competitors begin selling more electric vehicle models of their own.Tesla does not break out regional sales, but data from China's auto industry association, CPCA, showed Tesla Model 3 sedan sales remained roughly flat from July to September.

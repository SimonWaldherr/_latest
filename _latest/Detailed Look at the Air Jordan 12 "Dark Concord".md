As part of Jordan Brand‘s Holiday 2020 retro collection, the Air Jordan 12 has received a rich “Dark Concord” colorway. “Concord” is a storied hue in the greater Air Jordan lineage — appearing on iconic models like the Air Jordan 11 “Concord” — and here it’s used to give Michael Jordan‘s already-luxe 12th signature sneaker a metallic makeover.

Uppers are dressed in supple, smooth black leather with pebbled black leather on the signature mudguard providing a material contrast. The eponymous “Concord” shade, a rich purple, is presented in metallic fashion here, appearing on the midfoot overlays and two uppermost eyestays. It also graces the heel tab in non-metallic fashion.

Further branding is handled by white Jumpman logos on the tongue, white “TWO 3” spellouts on the throat and a #23 graphic on the lower heel. Zoom Air-equipped midsoles are done up in black and use a carbon fiber plate under the arch for support. Herringbone outsoles with final touches of purple and one more Jumpman logo round off the look.

The Air Jordan 12 “Dark Concord” will release in men’s and grade school sizes via Nike SNKRS and retailers like Foot Locker come October 23. The MSRP is set at $190 USD for men’s pairs and $140 USD for kids’ pairs.

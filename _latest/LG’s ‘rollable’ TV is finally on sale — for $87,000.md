<div><p>LG&#8217;s TV of the future is finally on sale &#8212; and it costs as much as a brand-new luxury sedan.</p>
<p>The Korean electronics giant made its cutting-edge &#8220;rollable&#8221; TV available for purchase on Tuesday, more than four years after unveiling its <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/01/04/lg-steps-into-future-unveils-bendable-tv/">groundbreaking bendable screen</a>.</p>
<p>The LG Signature OLED R, as it&#8217;s called, features a flexible 65-inch screen that can be tucked into a brushed-aluminum box whenever it&#8217;s not in use. LG said it&#8217;s selling the &#8220;exquisite creation&#8221; at seven electronics stores in South Korea.</p>
<p>Park Hyoung-sei, president of LG Home Entertainment Company, called the deluxe device &#8220;an unprecedented feat that genuinely deserves to be called a work of art.&#8221; But it comes with a price to match &#8212; 100 million Korean won, or $87,000.</p>
<p>LG first revealed its flexible screen technology in 2016 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, then returned to the convention with a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/07/this-amazing-fridge-will-order-more-beer-when-youre-running-low/">full TV prototype</a> last year. The rectangular base that holds the screen &#8212; which can be engraved with the owner&#8217;s name or a message &#8212; doubles as a speaker system.</p>
<p>Seoul-based LG says the invention &#8220;liberates users from the limitations of the wall&#8221; by allowing them to &#8220;curate their living environment&#8221; without making room for a big, black screen that just takes up space when it&#8217;s not being watched.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a true luxury product that reimagines what television can be, this unique TV delivers a differentiated user experience and a new way of thinking about space while once again confirming LG&#8217;s leadership in the premium TV market,&#8221; Park said in a <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2020/10/commercial-launch-of-lgs-long-awaited-rollable-oled-tv-marks-turning-point-in-tv-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>.</p>

Five states will vote on cannabis-legalization measures on November 3.

Business Insider put together a comprehensive ballot tracker, based on a variety of sources, to explain the various ballot measures and assign probabilities to each one's passing. It's available exclusively to subscribers.

With less than a month to go until the election, cannabis executives, investors, and activists are focused on five key states.

On November 3, New Jersey, Arizona, South Dakota, and Montana are set to vote on legalizing cannabis for all adults over the age of 21. South Dakota also has a medical-cannabis measure on the ballot, and Mississippi is voting on a medical-marijuana program.

Since Colorado and Washington broke ground in 2012 as the first US states to legalize recreational cannabis, nine states and Washington, DC, have joined them. Medical marijuana is legal in 33 states, meaning that a majority of Americans now have some form of access to legal marijuana.

Ballot initiatives like the ones voters are considering on November 3 have played a major role in the spread of legal cannabis. Nine of the states that legalized recreational marijuana did so through referendums.

Business Insider put together a ballot tracker to help you understand everything you need to know about the far-reaching implications of the cannabis measures voters are weighing.

To put the tracker together, we tapped a variety of sources to explain the nuances of each state's ballot measures and where polling stands, including analysts from the investment bank Cowen.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the "first order of business" will be to vote on a "targeted" COVID-19 relief plan, including new funding for the Paycheck Protection Program &#8212; a $500 billion package in total. Also on the Senate's agenda is to push through the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. After the Senate Judiciary Committee approves her nomination, which is expected to pass in a 12-10 party-line vote, the full Senate will consider her. McConnell said the chamber will bring up her nomination on Oct. 23, leaving a final vote on her confirmation likely to happen the week of Oct. 26.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Amy Coney Barrett hearings conclude:</strong> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/15/amy-coney-barrett-what-happens-next-her-confirmation-process/3664102001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Here's what happens next in Supreme Court confirmation</a></li></ul><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">All eyes on Florida as early voting kicks off</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Voters in Florida will have the option to cast their ballot in person on Monday as early voting begins in a state that has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1996. More than 1.7 million Floridians have already voted early by mail in Florida, with Democrats holding a big advantage&#160;&#8211; 850,000 Democrats have returned mail ballots, compared with 480,000 Republicans. In the meantime, the coronavirus continues to spread and the number of infections in Florida is trending up: 2,539 new cases reported Sunday, bringing the state&#8217;s overall total to 755,020 cases, with 16,168 deaths across the state.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Wildfires in Colorado continue to burn</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Smoke is in the forecast for Colorado on Monday,<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/18/colorado-wildfires-thousands-flee-cameron-peak-calwood-fires/3702819001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> as several wildfires continue to burn hundreds of thousands of acres all over the state</a>. One of them, the Cameron Peak Fire, has been burning for over two months and is the largest wildfire in the state's history, having burned more than 200,000 acres. Health officials have issued air quality alerts for parts of the state, and voluntary and mandatory evacuations have been called as firefighters work to control the fire, which was 62% contained as of Sunday. High winds drove the wildfires into residential areas, destroying an unknown number of&#160;homes. Fire officials said cooler weather moving into the area helped with containment, but significant fire activity and areas of thick smoke are expected over the week ahead.&#160;</p><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Colorado's largest wildfire ever:</strong>&#160;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/17/cameron-peak-fire-area-braces-for-more-high-winds/3693972001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">These photos show the intense smoke</a></li></ul><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/nation/2020/10/18/colorado-wildfires-force-evacuations/3705872001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Kamala Harris back on the campaign trail</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen.

Dillon said Harris wasn&#8217;t in close contact with either person within two days of the tests and so faces no obligation to quarantine. In place of the missed in-person events, Harris planned virtual events, and says she&#8217;ll continue a "robust and aggressive" schedule.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Denver security guard to be charged with 2nd-degree murder</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A television station security guard <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/15/denver-security-guard-charged-second-degree-murder/3672032001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">will be charged with second-degree murder on Monday</a> in the fatal shooting of a man at a "Patriot Rally" in Denver last weekend. Denver's district attorney announced that she plans to charge Matthew Dolloff, 30, with second-degree murder for the death of Lee Keltner, 49, an armed services veteran, who was at a "Patriot Rally," a right-wing demonstration that happened while protesters at a left-wing "BLM-Antifa Soup Drive" demonstration held signs and rallied against white supremacists. Officials say Dolloff was working as a private security guard for a KUTA-TV producer during the opposing rallies when he was involved in a confrontation with Keltner, who shot pepper spray at him just before Dolloff fired his gun, photos of which have gone viral on social media. Keltner was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died an hour later.&#160;</p><ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"><li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"><strong>Opposing rallies in Denver:&#160;</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/11/denver-shooting-security-guard-custody-blm-patriot-rally/5960408002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Security guard in custody following shooting death</a><br>&#160;</li></ul></div>

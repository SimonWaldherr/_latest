  CDC redefines COVID-19 close contact, adds brief... 
description: > 
  US health officials Wednesday redefined what counts as close contact with someone with COVID-19 to include briefer but repeated encounters.For months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said close contact meant spending a solid 15 minutes within 6 feet of someone who tested positive for coronavirus.On Wednesday, the CDC changed it to a total of 15 minutes or more - so shorter but repeated contacts that add up to 15 minutes over a 24-hour period now count.The CDC now advises anyone who has been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient to quarantine for two weeks.CDC now includes a series of brief encounters that add up to 15 minutes spent with an covid-positive person as 'close contact.'

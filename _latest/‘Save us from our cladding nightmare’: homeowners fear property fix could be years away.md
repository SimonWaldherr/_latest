<div><p>Homeowners have seen their dreams turn to nightmares thanks to the cladding crisis&#160;that risks derailing Britain&#8217;s property market.</p>
<p>Residents have been told by surveyors that their homes are effectively worthless because there is no proof the material used to clad their buildings is safe. Without this information, banks will not offer mortgages, leaving residents unable to sell.</p>
<p>Freeholders who are responsible for managing these high-rise blocks have been unwilling to pay for the checks that would declare the buildings safe. Critics say some owners could be refusing to test their blocks because they may have to spend millions of pounds on repair work if problems are uncovered.</p>
<p>The Government has released waves of new regulations, but this <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/15bn-property-problem-inside-cladding-circle-blame/">has resulted in a deadlock</a> between policymakers, banks, valuers and building owners. Homeowners across the country are trapped in the middle, fearing for their own safety and unable to get on with their lives. Telegraph Money talks to six people affected by the cladding crisis.</p>
<h3>&#8216;It costs &#163;50,000 a month for fire wardens to guard my flat&#8217;</h3>
<p>As her building is less than 60ft tall, Vicky Gilder was hopeful that she would not fall foul of the cladding rules. Miss Gilder, 46, who works in publishing, put her flat on the market in late February and accepted an offer within a week.</p>
<p>The EWS1 form, which banks require <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/much-should-ews1-cladding-form-cost-questions-answered/">before they will offer a mortgage</a>, does not generally apply to properties below that height unless there are specific safety concerns.</p>
<p>But on the evening of March 27 residents of Roffo Court in south London received an email from their freeholder, L&amp;Q, warning that their block was clad with flammable high-pressure laminate and that it was a major fire risk.</p>
<p>This shocking news meant that her agreed property sale fell through, leaving Miss Gilder&#8217;s plan to move closer to her family in tatters. Now she must wait until repair works are carried out. &#8220;We feel completely in limbo, not knowing how many years we might be stuck in an unsellable flat,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Because of the significant fire risk, her block must now be monitored 24 hours a day by a dedicated fire warden. Even though the cost of the warden &#8211; which could reach &#163;50,000 a month &#8211; will be covered by L&amp;Q&#8217;s fire safety fund, she has concerns about how this money will be recovered in the long run. She currently pays more than &#163;200 a month in service charges. &#8220;We are dreading what it may go up to,&#8221; she said.</p>

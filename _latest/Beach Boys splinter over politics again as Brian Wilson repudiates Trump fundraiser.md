<p>The L.A. Times  <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-18/trump-fundraiser-california">published a story </a>about the fundraiser Sunday, including the detail that Love&#8217;s touring version of the group would headline the event. The Beach Boys formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, less than an hour&#8217;s drive from Lido Isle, the exclusive man-made island in Newport Beach where Trump&#8217;s campaign held the fundraiser.</p><p>&#8220;Everyone assumes he&#8217;s going to go to battleground states. No one really thinks about how Orange County, California, is an ATM machine,&#8221; Jon Fleischman, a former state GOP official, <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-18/trump-fundraiser-california">told The Times</a>  Sunday.</p><p>In 2016, Orange County shifted blue and voted Democratic in a presidential election for the <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-18/trump-fundraiser-california">first time since the Great Depression</a>. Its collective pockets however, remain deep &#8212; and GOP donors still have a strong presence.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>&#8220;The only reason a presidential candidate should be in California in late October is if the GPS breaks or if he is so desperate for money that he has no choice,&#8221; political strategist Dan Schnur <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-10-18/trump-fundraiser-california">told The Times</a>. &#8220;At this stage in the campaign, every hour is precious. The fact that the candidate himself has to raise money in person means their fundraising situation is way beyond dire.&#8221;</p><p>But Sunday wasn&#8217;t the first time the &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t It Be Nice&#8221; hitmakers divided over political differences. In February, Wilson and Jardine both <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-02-03/brian-wilson-beach-boys-donald-trump-jr-hunting">signed a Change.org</a> petition urging supporters to &#8220;Say No to Trophy Hunting!&#8221;</p><p>At the time, the request called for a boycott of Love&#8217;s group after it secured a headlining spot at the Safari Club International Convention in Reno,  where Donald Trump Jr. was the keynote speaker.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand there are so many factions and fractious things going on &#8212; the chips will fall where they may,&#8221; Love added. &#8220;But Donald Trump has never been anything but kind to us. We have known him for many a year. We&#8217;ve performed at some of his venues at fundraisers and so on.&#8221;</p><p></p></div>

Peugeot believes that it won’t be long before electric car (EV) driving is normal, so it’s offering its new battery powertrains in very familiar models. So, is the electric 208 the entry-level electric car to sway the masses?

Our car: Peugeot e-208 GT

Peugeot e-208 GT List price when new: £30,275 (after Government plug-in grant)

£30,275 (after Government plug-in grant) Price as tested: £30,820 (after Government grant)

£30,820 (after Government grant) Official range (WLTP): 217 miles

The Peugeot approach to electric cars (EVS) seems like common sense to me. While I like the extrovert, deliberately unusual EVs such as the Volkswagen ID.3 and BMW i3, which shout very loudly that they’re a bit different, Peugeot thinks it won’t be long before electric power isn’t ‘different’ at all.

Hence the e-208; virtually undistinguishable from the Car of the Year-winning 208 models with petrol or diesel engines, but with a pure electric powertrain underneath. The 50kWh battery delivers a range of 217 miles and, given that you can get the e-208 from less than £27,000, that all seems very tempting.

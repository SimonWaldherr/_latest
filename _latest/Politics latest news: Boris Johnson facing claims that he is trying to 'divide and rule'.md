<p>Boris Johnson is going&#160;head-to-head with Sir Keir Starmer in the last PMQs before recess,&#160;after being accused of trying to "divide and rule" regional leaders by playing them off against each other.&#160;</p>
<p>The Government has saved face with regional leaders somewhat, after concluding a relatively painless set of talks with South Yorkshire leaders including Labour MP Dan Jarvis.&#160;</p>
<p>But London&#8217;s Mayor Sadiq Khan called on ministers not to be &#8220;vindictive&#8221; towards the capital amid increasingly acrimonious talks to bail out TfL.&#160;</p>
<p>Yesterday Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, warned that &#8220;punishing&#8221; negotiations with local leaders could end up fracturing the country.&#160;</p>
<p>Tensions are still high in parts of the North after the Government cut Mr Burnham out of talks yesterday, with the Labour politician appearing to learn about the &#163;22m package via text during a live press conference.&#160;</p>
<p>Labour frontbencher Lisa Nandy claimed minister were trying to &#8220;divide and rule&#8221; regional leaders by &#8220;playing them off against each other&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>Nadine Dorries, the health minister, accused him of &#8220;playing to the gallery&#8221;, claiming he had been "personally and respectfully" called by Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick "and told the news long before this tableau was played out".</p>
<p>Mr Burnham has rejected her claims.&#160;</p>

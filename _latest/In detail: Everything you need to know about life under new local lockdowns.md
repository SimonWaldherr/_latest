Twelve areas across the midlands and north of England including Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak, fall into this high-risk classification.

Mr Johnson added that in "very high" areas "the Government will set a baseline of prohibiting social mixing indoors and in private gardens and, Iâ€™m sorry to say, closing pubs and bars".

In these areas only people from one household (or a support bubble) will be allowed to mix indoors or in outdoor gardens, hospitality or ticketed venues.

Outdoor gatherings will be limited to six, in outdoor spaces like parks and tennis courts.

The Government said it was creating a postcode checker on its website (Gov.uk) so people can type in their postcodes and find out local alert level, and work out what they need to do to follow guidance.

At this stage, the rules will only apply to the Liverpool City Region from Wednesday.

Mr Johnson told local Sefton Central MP Bill Esterson that the R rate In Liverpool would have to fall to below one for the restrictions to be lifted.

He added: "We will keep all restrictions under constant review in order to remove them as soon as we possibly can."

Mr Johnson also said he wanted his teams to look at "creative solutions" to enable relatives to visit elderly family members in care homes.

Travel restricted for those Tier 3

People should not be leaving areas in the "very high" tier and travelling elsewhere in the country, Mr Johnson said.

The PM was challenged in the Commons over whether people in Liverpool, where the incidence of cases is running at 1,600 per 100,000, can travel to north Wales, where cases as as low as 18 per 100,000.

He said: "The guidance is very clear that people from 'very high' areas such as Merseyside should not be making those journeys."

Guidance published on Monday showed there are no restrictions on travel or overnight stays for people living in areas in the "medium" tier.

People living in the "high" tier are allowed to "continue to travel to open venues within the area", but the guidance urges them to "minimise [the] number of journeys".

In the "very high" tier, people are "advised against travel in or out of the affected area, with the exception of those going to school or work if they cannot do their job at home. They are also advised to "travel to open venues within [the] area but minimise the number of journeys".

The guidance adds: "Those in the area [are] advised against overnight stays in other parts of the UK. People outside of the area [are] advised against overnight stays in the area."

Mr Johnson told MPs: "People should have the freedom from fear, the freedom from seeing their jobs destroyed in the long term, and the freedom to go about their lives in the normal way.

"The only way to restore those freedoms to this country is to follow the guidance, get through this thing in the way that we are doing, and get back to normal as fast as possible."

Hotels, casinos and gyms

Hotels are allowed to stay open under the Government's new local alert levels but will be hit by Tier 2 restrictions and hardest by Tier 3, which advises people that they should not travel in or out of any affected areas unless for "clear" exceptions, such as work or education.

People in Tier 3 areas are also advised against overnight stays in other parts of the UK, and visitors from other areas are advised against travelling into Tier 3 districts.

Like pubs and restaurants, any dining or drinking facilities open to the public are subject to the same conditions. Hotels also face Tier 2 restrictions that forbid mingling of households in hotel bars or restaurants.

The result, according to UKHospitality, will be serious economic damage to the sector.

"The messaging around Tier 2 guidance against non-essential travel could deter people from making trips over half-term. That's essential for hotels and guest houses to survive," said Ms Nicholls.

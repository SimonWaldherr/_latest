<div><p>Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (Fan Edition), a more affordable version (Rs 49,990) of the Galaxy S20 was launched earlier this month in India. The Galaxy S20 FE promises to offer everything that people love about the pricey Galaxy S20 without costing you an arm and a leg.</p>

<p>As expected from a major price drop, there are certain differences between the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and the Galaxy S20. But, are these differences too big to make you want to ditch the Galaxy S20 FE over Galaxy S20? Does the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE really offer bang for the buck when compared to the tough competition out there in the premium mid-range segment? I&#8217;ve been spending some time with the phone and here&#8217;s what I think of it.</p>

<h3>WHAT&#8217;S SMASHABLE</h3>
<h3>Fun Colors And Design</h3>
<img alt="&#160;" class="image photo" src="https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/photo/default/samsung-s20-edit-07_tut7.jpg">

<p>The Galaxy S20 FE looks exactly like the Galaxy S20 except for a few differences in build quality, size, and weight of the phone. First off, the colors available for this phone are absolutely stunning. If you&#8217;re a lover of pastel shades, you&#8217;ll be able to find some great picks. I got the &#8216;Cloud Mint&#8217; color and it&#8217;s a beautiful pastel minty shade that reflects off a golden sea-green sheen from different angles. Total color options available in India include <i>Cloud Red, Cloud Lavender, Cloud Mint, Cloud Navy, and Cloud White. </i>So, there&#8217;s something for everyone.</p>

<p>The phone features a matte plastic rear panel that seamlessly meets the aluminum metal chassis along the edges and the front. So, it doesn&#8217;t use glass as the Galaxy S20 does, but that doesn&#8217;t really take away from the premium visual appeal of the Galaxy S20 FE. It still looks high-quality and is soft to touch.</p>

<p>Also, polycarbonate bodies don't easily shatter or dent, unlike glass, giving it bonus points for durability. It&#8217;s also non-slippery and there&#8217;s no issue of fingerprint smudges, which is golden. So, I don&#8217;t really have a problem with the overall build quality of the phone. Galaxy S20 FE is slightly heavier than the S20, weighing 190 grams, but I didn&#8217;t find it uncomfortable to hold for even longer periods of time. Caveat: You don&#8217;t get a headphone jack on the S20 FE just like S20, which is a bummer.</p>

<h3>More Screen Real Estate</h3>
<p>The Galaxy S20 FE has a bigger 6.5-inch display as compared to Galaxy S20 but comes with the same punch-hole cutout for the front camera. The bigger screen means more space to watch movies, TV shows, and videos, which is awesome. Talking about the specs, it features a Super AMOLED Full-HD+ 1080x2400 pixels resolution with 120 Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>Now, Galaxy S20 FE does provide lower resolution as compared to Galaxy S20, meaning the colors that you get to see are not as vivid, bright, and detailed as the one on Galaxy S20. However, the display on the Galaxy S20 FE is still pretty good on its own. It offers a bright panel with impressive maximum and minimum brightness levels. The color range is also good and the 120Hz refresh rate just makes everything more buttery and smooth. It also gives it an edge over competitors. Sunlight legibility is also good enough.</p>

<h3><strong>Powerful Smooth Performance</strong></h3>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S20 FE features an Exynos 990 processor, unlike the Snapdragon 865 and 865+ that&#8217;s packed in most of the phones out there in this segment. This is coupled with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. You can also expand the storage on the phone with microSD card slot.</p>

<p>The performance on the Galaxy S20 FE is really good for both everyday tasks like clicking photos, browsing through the web, listening to music, watching videos, texting, as well as for tasks like playing graphics-intensive games <i>(Call Of Duty, Asphalt 9, etc). </i>It also offers a good multitasking experience and I didn&#8217;t come across any stutter or lags when juggling between multiple apps. However, there&#8217;s one caveat and that&#8217;s the heating issue, but more on this later.</p>

<p>Coming to the software, the Galaxy S20 FE comes with Samsung One UI 2.5 which is clean and navigating through the interface is speedy. Another good thing is that you don&#8217;t get a lot of bloatware as the device asks you the apps that you want pre-install on the device during phone set-up. The app icons are well-designed and also offers the option to customize the theme and look of your phone which is great.</p>

<h3>Camera</h3>
<img alt="&#160;" class="image photo" src="https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/photo/default/samsung-s20-edit-01_u3rw.jpg">

<p>Let&#8217;s quickly get the specs out of the way - you get a triple camera setup at the back with 12-megapixel primary camera, 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and 30x space zoom. On the front, you get a 32-megapixel camera for selfies.</p>

<p>So, while there are a few differences in the camera features on Galaxy S20 FE and the Galaxy S20, the former still holds its own pretty well. Coming to the rear camera experience, the pictures turn out nice, crisp, detailed, and have a good dynamic range. If you look at the camera samples, you&#8217;ll see that the camera really brings out the colors of the flowers without making it look overly saturated or unnatural. So, yes the pinks are a bit pinkier and the green looks a lot greener, but I&#8217;m not complaining. Also, the 30x zoom is pretty darn impressive during daylight.</p>

<img alt="" class="image photo" src="https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/photo/default/samsung-s20-edit-06_vgmu.jpg">

<p>The pictures with 30x zoom do have a lot of noise, but the fact that the it managed to capture the details that it did from a very far distance is impressive for a phone in this segment. You&#8217;re mostly not going to be using 30x zoom on an everyday basis, but it&#8217;s still nice to see the details that it managed to capture. In another sample, you can see that the camera didn&#8217;t blow the sky out of proportion or made it look artificial, which is always a good sign.</p>

<p>Speaking of low-light photos, they turned out to be pretty good too with night mode being a real lifesaver. You&#8217;d still notice noise peeking in on most shots, but it&#8217;s not too bad to spoil a picture. Night mode really helps adds exposure to pictures without taking away from the detail. The selfie camera is also good but does smooth out your photos even without enabling any face smoothening mode. But, it&#8217;s not unnatural and is enough to enhance the overall picture.</p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/158343654@N04/albums/72157716556475713" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="samsung galaxy s20 fe"><img alt="samsung galaxy s20 fe" src=""></a>

<p>You get a slew of fun modes like <i>single take, pro, panorama, food, night, live focus, live focus video, pro video, super-slow-mo, slow motion, and hyperlapse. </i>They&#8217;re a lot of fun and each does something different. The hyperlapse mode performs well in the case of rear camera but lacks detail when you film with the front camera and also lowers the overall video quality significantly.</p>

<p>Lastly, the camera can record only 4K video at 60fps, unlike Galaxy S20 where you can shoot a video in 8K. But, honestly, shooting in 4K should suffice for most instances and you really won&#8217;t be using the 8K too much so I don&#8217;t consider this a minus in any way.</p>

<h3>WHAT&#8217;S NOT SMASHABLE</h3>
<h3>Battery Life And 15W charger</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the battery isn&#8217;t bad but I expected better, especially considering the competition. The Galaxy S20 FE comes with a 4,500 mAh battery, which is actually bigger than the 4,000 mAh pack in the Galaxy S20, meaning longer battery life.</p>

<p>So this is a plus in the sense that it has better battery life than the expensive Galaxy S20, but the battery is just enough to last you a day with heavy use. It can last you a day and a bit more if you don&#8217;t use it too heavily. However, what&#8217;s a real bummer is that the phone ships with a 15-watt charger in the box.</p>

<p>During times where every smartphone, especially in this range, ships with a fast charger, the 15W charger is a big letdown. It takes over two hours for the phone to fully charge. So, if you want a fast charger, be ready to shell out extra money. The phone does support up to 25-watt wired charging, which is a saving grace.</p>

<h3>Heating Issues</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is an issue with the unit that I&#8217;ve received, but the phone heats up a lot. So, it&#8217;s normal for a phone to heat up a bit once you start playing intensive games, but the unit that I've received gets abnormally hot after 40 minutes of playing. I also observed this on certain random occasions like when setting up the phone, clicking pictures, and with some other apps, where the heating issue led to app crashes. Again, not sure if there&#8217;s an issue with all the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE units or if there&#8217;s something wrong with the one that I&#8217;ve received.</p>

<h3>Optical Fingerprint</h3>
<p>The Galaxy S20 FE comes with an in-screen optical fingerprint sensor. Although it&#8217;s pretty quick, it&#8217;s more often than not that it&#8217;ll show &#8216;no match&#8217;. So, you&#8217;ll have to be careful when placing your finger on it and press hard for it to match. An ultrasonic sensor would have been a better choice.</p>

<h3>FINAL VERDICT</h3>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE ticks all the boxes of a flagship experience - premium looks, 120Hz refresh rate, solid performance, bigger battery, and great cameras. There are a few features missing here that exist on the Galaxy S20, but all the important stuff that you&#8217;ll actually use on a daily basis is all packed in on the Galaxy S20 FE. So, you do get a high-end smartphone experience without hurting your pocket.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s possible to find huge discounts on the Galaxy S20 online where you&#8217;d be able to find it at a similar price point as the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. So, keep that in mind and make the final choice depending on the cost savings.</p>

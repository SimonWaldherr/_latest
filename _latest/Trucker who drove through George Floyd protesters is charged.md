Authorities had closed area highways as a precaution, but traffic camera video showed that the trucker entered the downtown freeway system from a ramp that wasn&#8217;t barricaded, for reasons that remain unclear.</p><p>When Vechirko saw the crowd on the bridge, he &#8220;relied on his professional instinct and training to avoid a hard brake that could have jackknifed the truck and could have seriously injured or killed thousands of people, and instead slowed his vehicle while maneuvering through the parted crowd,&#8221; his attorney Mark Solheim, told the newspaper.</p><p>Gov.

  Stop demonising youngsters for partying after Covid curfew, says 1922 Committee vice-chairman

  The virus is endemic – locking down for three weeks is just going to be like turning down a wood burning stove just to slumber.It's not going to burn itself out and, when you turn the wood burning stove on in the morning, the wood ignites again.This is a solution that is going to condemn millions and millions of people to a lot of misery and unhappiness.""And I suspect that a lot of the people making these decisions don't really have any friends who work in the private sector either."Sir Charles Walker is joined on this week's episode of Chopper's Politics by David Davis MP and economist and Telegraph columnist Liam Halligan.

Sir Charles warned: "More family businesses going to the wall, more big businesses laying people off, a brewery in the north of England over 2,000 today. This is not a humane response."

He said a "circuit-breaker" lockdown was "not a sensible response", adding: "Let's be clear. The virus is endemic – locking down for three weeks is just going to be like turning down a wood burning stove just to slumber.

"The wood will smoulder away. It's not going to burn itself out and, when you turn the wood burning stove on in the morning, the wood ignites again. So this [a 'circuit-breaker'] is not a long-term solution. This is a solution that is going to condemn millions and millions of people to a lot of misery and unhappiness."

Sir Charles said the economic consequence of shutting down the economy was "mass, mass unemployment, for a start. An economy that could be hobbled for decades. Debts and deficits of unimaginable scale".

He added: "The problem is a lot of these decisions are being made by people who have no experience of the private sector, who have worked I'm sure with great diligence in the public sector, but have never worried about paying their staff at the end of the month, balancing the books.

"And I suspect that a lot of the people making these decisions don't really have any friends who work in the private sector either."

<p>Another debate was scheduled for October 15, which was planned to take place virtually after Trump tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. The Trump campaign indicated that it did not want to participate in the debate virtually, and the Biden campaign went on to schedule a town hall with ABC News for the same day.</p><p>The Trump campaign subsequently planned a town hall with NBC News at the same time, and the debate commission released a statement on October 9 that the second debate would be cancelled in light of the separate events.</p><p>In the statement from the debate commission regarding the new rules, the panel recognized that "neither campaign may be totally satisfied with the measures announced today. One may think they go too far, and one may think they do not go far enough."</p><p>"We are comfortable that these actions strike the right balance and that they are in the interest of the American people, for whom these debates are held," the statement concluded.</p>

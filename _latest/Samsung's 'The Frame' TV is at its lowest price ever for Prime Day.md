Save up to $800: "The Frame," Samsung's 4K TV famous for doubling as wall art, is seeing really good sale prices this Prime Day. Save up to $500 and score the 32-inch model for $479.99 or the largest 75-inch model for just over $2,000.

Treating yourself is acceptable at any point in time, but it's especially justifiable during a time when social interaction — the company of other humans — is a rarity, and loneliness is the norm.

If you've been chewing on potentially spending the money that you've saved from not buying multiple vodka seltzers and appetizers every weekend, a ridiculously nice TV could be deserving. Conveniently, Samsung's The Frame — the 4K TV that doubles as a painting or a mesmerizing piece of the wall behind it — is on sale for Prime Day at its most affordable prices in recent history (according to price tracker Camelcamelcamel.)

Staring at your walls as a form of socially-distant entertainment isn't so bad when The Frame is hanging up there. When it's time to binge-watch, the Frame streams in 4K UHD in over a billion shades of color created by Quantum dots. (It's also HDR compatible.)

When it's time to do anything besides binge-watch, The Frame can morph into a piece of art, pulling pieces from an ever-growing library of work by real artists. If you'd prefer something more in-line with your space, The Frame's AI can use a photo of the wall behind it (taken by you) to literally blend in with your room's paint color, bricks, or wallpaper.

The Frame comes in sizes from 32 inches to 75 inches, all of which are up to 28% off at Amazon. (Prices may vary slightly per user for algorithmic reasons):

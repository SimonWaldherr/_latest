The Information Commissioner’s Office said it has been made aware of the email and pledged to review the information provided.

Klarna added that the message was sent to customers that had used Klarna’s products or services, including its checkout technology which processes details for some online shops. The company said that when someone uses Klarna, they agree to its terms and conditions and privacy notice.

The Swedish firm is best known for its front-facing short-term financing for online shoppers. Its checkout technology is less well known but is used by some retailers to process payments on their website.

In a blog post, bosses said: “This means that Klarna processes all credit and debit card transactions for these retailers.

“This data is used for several purposes, e.g. to help us screen for fraud, process payments, and help retailers to manage shipping.”

The company insisted that people who unexpectedly received the newsletter had not been added to a marketing database.

It said: “We are currently investigating how this happened, and are taking action to ensure nothing like this can happen again in the future."

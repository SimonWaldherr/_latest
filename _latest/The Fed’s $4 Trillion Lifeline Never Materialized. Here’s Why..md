  The Fed’s $4 Trillion Lifeline Never Materialized. Here’s Why.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But the Fed&#8217;s vast power comes with strings attached. Treasury must approve of any lending programs it wants to set up. The programs must lend to solvent entities and be broad-based, rather than targeting one or two individual firms. If the borrowers are risky, the Fed requires insurance from either the private sector or the Treasury Department.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Early in the crisis, the Treasury used existing money to back <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/economy/federal-reserve-coronavirus.html" title="">market-focused stabilization programs</a>. But that funding source was finite, and as Mr. Mnuchin negotiated with Congress, he pushed for money to back a broader spate of Fed lending efforts.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The central bank itself made a major announcement on March 23, as the package was being negotiated. It said it was making plans to funnel money into a wide array of desperate hands, not just into Wall Street&#8217;s plumbing. Officials would set up an effort to lend to small and medium-size businesses, the Fed said, and another that would keep corporate bonds flowing. It would go on to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/fed-economic-rescue-coronavirus.html" title="">expand that program</a> to include some recently downgraded bonds, so-called fallen angels, and to add a bond-buying program for state and local governments.</p><h2 class="css-1aoo5yy eoo0vm40" id="link-c8c5e13">That $454 billion was slightly random.</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Congress allocated $454 billion in support of the programs as part of the economic relief package signed into law on March 27. When the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-04/hr748.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Congressional Budget Office estimated</a> the budget effects of that funding, it did not count the cost toward the federal deficit, since borrowers would repay on the Fed&#8217;s loans, and fees and earnings should offset losses.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Mnuchin and congressional leaders did not settle on that sum for a very precise economic reason, a senior Treasury official said, but they knew conditions were bad and wanted to go big.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Overdoing it would cost nothing, and the size of the pot allowed Mr. Mnuchin to say that the partners could pump &#8220;up to $4 trillion&#8221; into the economy.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">It was like nuclear deterrence for financial markets: Promise that the government had enough liquidity-blasting superpower to conquer any threat, and people would stop running for safer places to put their money. Crisis averted, there would be no need to actually use the ammunition.</p></div>

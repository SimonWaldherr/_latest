<div><p>Revival of Pakistani cinema has been the mantra for the past few years. Many new directors have come up with good movies and some are even experimenting with new genres. However, 50 Crores is trending on all social media platforms for all the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>The posters released yesterday showcase blatant ripoff or copy of the Spanish hit show, Money Heist. The Spanish TV show called &#8220;La Casa de Papel&#8217; revolves around an unusual group of robbers who attempt to carry out the most perfect robbery in Spanish history- that is to steal 2.4 billion euros from the Royal Mint of Spain. The show has garnered attention from around the globe with die hard fans in Pakistan as well.</p>

<p>But with 50 crore&#8217;s posters many users and fans now feel disappointed. The movie copies the same element that showcases mugshots of the robbers and the name of places they are from. Which is exactly what the Spanish TV show does. In order to calm the audience, the director of the movie states that the movie is so much more than what the posters interpret. But we are still skeptical. Many local art films have made it to international platforms and won awards and are seldom highlighted or showcased in cinema houses. But sad ripoffs like 50 crores get all the attention. About time, our local industry realizes that we need to come up with exciting projects rather than copying from international platforms.</p>

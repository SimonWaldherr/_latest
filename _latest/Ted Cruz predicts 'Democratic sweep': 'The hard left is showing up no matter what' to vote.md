Ted Cruz said Sunday the 2020 election has the most wide variety of potential outcomes he's ever seen as he cast doubt that Republicans will show up in the same capacity as Democrats.

'There's an incredible volatility in politics right now. The delta between possible outcomes is as wide as I've ever seen it,' the Texas senator told NBC's 'Meet the Press' Sunday morning.

Cruz also explained the November election will come down to turnout, meaning there are not a lot of undecided voters and it will be decided by which party can get the most voters to cast ballots.

'I think this is a turnout election,' the Republican Trump ally told NBC host Chuck Todd. 'I think the hard left is showing up no matter what. They hate the president. And the big open question is: Does everybody else show up? I hope that they do.'

Texas Senator Ted Cruz admitted Sunday morning that there could be a 'Democratic sweep' in November as he said 'the hard left is showing up no matter what'

Although Cruz says he thinks there could be a 'Democratic sweep,' he also exhibited a more realistic approach than many other politicians by weighing both outcomes.

'I think there's a scenario – I believe President Trump can win, in fact I believe he could have a significant victory and Republicans can take both Houses of Congress,' Cruz said of his own Party. 'But I also think it is possible we see a Democratic sweep where they win everything and it's a victory of Watergate proportions.'

He added: 'I don't recall an election in my life with the spread – the delta – between those two possible outcomes this close to an election being that wide.'

'If people are optimistic and hopeful about the future – if they're going back to work – that would be a factor in a very good election for Republicans. If they're pessimistic and depressed and hopeless – that will help the Democrats,' Cruz continued.

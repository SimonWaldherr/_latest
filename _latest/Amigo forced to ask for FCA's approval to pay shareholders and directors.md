  Amigo forced to ask for FCA's approval to pay shareholders and directors 
description: > 
  Subprime lender Amigo Holdings will need to get the City watchdog's approval to pay out any cash to directors and dividends to shareholders, it said today.The FCA says it uses Vreq 'where we suspect serious misconduct may have occurred and harm needs to be prevented immediately'.The company also tried to reassure shareholders that it has 'adequate liquidity' to continue to fund operations and support its customers.Benamor's plans to return to the company were thwarted last month when shareholders voted against his proposals.But they still dealt directors a blow with a substantial proportion of votes backing the founder's plans above those of the board.

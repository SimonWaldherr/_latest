  Sorry Jerry Jones: It's Going to Get Worse for Mike McCarthy's Cowboys

  Ron Jenkins/Associated PressAndy Dalton doesn't have a clue and that's not even the worst part about the Dallas Cowboys' 38-10 loss Monday to the Arizona Cardinals.Instead, the thought of the Cowboys offense continuing as it had through the first five games was folly.Dalton's comments last week after starting quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a season-ending ankle injury couldn't have been more hilariously inaccurate.I feel like we can just run this offense," Dalton told reporters Friday.To make matters worse, the Cowboys medical staff ruled Zack Martin out of Monday's game after he suffered a concussion.

(AP Photo/Ron Jenkins)" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">Ron Jenkins/Associated Press</p><p class=""><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/andy-dalton">Andy Dalton</a> doesn't have a clue and that's not even the worst part about the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>' 38-10 loss Monday to the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>.</p><p class="">Little to no positives can be taken from the Cowboys' latest effort, and a new hope isn't forthcoming. Dallas is a bad football team with massive concerns throughout the roster and overall execution. The only reason why its season still matters is Dallas plays in the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nfl">NFL</a>'s worst division. Even so, there's absolutely no reason to expect improved play anytime soon.</p><p class="">Let's start at quarterback. The backup-turned-starter really didn't have a chance against the Cardinals for multiple reasons, but those will become clear in a matter of moments. Instead, the thought of the Cowboys offense continuing as it had through the first five games was folly.</p><p id="br-ad-29245129" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Dalton's comments last week after starting quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a season-ending ankle injury couldn't have been more hilariously inaccurate.</p><p class="">"We don't see things changing much. I feel like we can just run this offense," Dalton <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30127638/andy-dalton-aims-keep-dallas-cowboys-offense-drop-dak-prescott" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> Friday. "I've been in a lot of different systems and kind of been through it all, so I like everything that we're doing and my job is to keep this thing exactly how Dak had it. Dak was playing really well, and we don't feel like we want there to be any drop-off since he's not going to be in there."</p><p class="">Dallas brought the NFL's top-ranked passing offense into Week 6. Prescott still leads the NFL with 1,856 passing yards despite missing part of last week's contest and not playing Monday.</p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="molecule thumbnail"><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png">Video Play Button</a><p class="atom video-indicator"><p class="text">Videos you might like </p> </p><p class="">Yes, the Cowboys have exciting pieces at the skill positions. But a strong foundation always led the Cowboys dating back to their glory years.</p><p class="">As good as Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott and any wide receiver on the roster is, Dallas' real strength started in the trenches with one of the best offensive lines the league has seen over the past decade. The current incarnation is a shadow compared to what it once was.</p><p class="">Center Travis Frederick retired this past offseason. His replacement, Joe Looney, is currently dealing with a sprained MCL. Tackles Tyron Smith and Le'el Collins are both on injured reserve. To make matters worse, the Cowboys medical staff ruled Zack Martin out of Monday's game after he <a href="https://twitter.com/toddarcher/status/1318372770317766656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered a concussion</a>.</p><p id="br-ad-54385590" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">So, the current configuration of the Cowboys offense front is as follows: left tackle Brandon Knight, left guard Conner Williams, rookie center Tyler Biadasz, right guard Connor McGovern and undrafted rookie right tackle Terence Steele.</p><p class="">Much of the blame will fall on the quarterback, because that's how the league and its coverage tend to work. But Dalton was under fire from the Cardinals defense all night long. Arizona sacked the red rifle twice, hit him eight more times and deflected nine passes. The Cardinals didn't have to worry about the vertical passing attack, because it was non-existent due to protection issues. Instead, Vance Joseph's crew pinned its ears back, stopped the run game, got after the quarterback and had a secondary playing flat-footed ready to drive on the football.</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">Ron Jenkins/Associated Press</p><p class="">The thought of Dalton stepping into a near-apocalyptic situation and leading the offense to a safe place like Rick Grimes simply wasn't going to happen.</p><p class="">"You can never take for granted the presence and the command of Dak Prescott. It was definitely noticeable," head coach <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/mike-mccarthy">Mike McCarthy</a> said. "Frankly, it hit me from the practice structure when I went out to the quarterback school, not having him there with the two quarterbacks. But you have to turn the page on all injury situations. I think we were so fortunate and blessed to have Andy Dalton. Andy has such a great way about him. It's a different leadership style."</p><p class="">No one should deny what Dalton has done throughout his career. He was a long-term starter with plenty of experience to front a fully capable unit. The Cowboys aren't capable pretty much anywhere at the moment, aside from wide receiver&#8212;which is the least important position because the Cowboys can't even protect the quarterback or get the ball out with any consistency.</p><p id="br-ad-71458929" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Even three-time Pro Bowl running back Ezekiel Elliott struggled through one the worst games of his career with two fumbles and 49 yards on 12 carries. He now has five fumbles in five games.</p><p class="">"We've still got a good shot at [winning the NFC East]. We've got to figure it out," Elliott <a href="https://twitter.com/GehlkenNFL/status/1318396300933685248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> after the loss. "I've got to figure this thing out."</p><p class="">In total, the Cowboys own a minus-12 turnover differential, per the <a href="https://www.footballdb.com/stats/turnovers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Football Database</a>.</p><p class="">"We're the worst in the league at taking care of the football," McCarthy <a href="https://twitter.com/GehlkenNFL/status/1318396850047717379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a>." ...It's frustrating to see the pattern here in five of the six games this year."</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">Michael Ainsworth/Associated Press</p><p class="">Right now, the Cowboys have nowhere to turn on offense.</p><p class="">Amazingly, Dallas' problems are even worse on defense, but that's nothing new. Arizona head coach Kliff Kingsbury and quarterback Kyler Murray easily bamboozled the league's least disciplined defensive unit. Murray put together arguably the worst throwing performance of his two-year career, and the Cardinals offense still managed 438 total yards.</p><p class="">The situation became so bad for Dallas that Arizona tried to run out the clock late in the fourth quarter by simply slamming running back Kenyan Drake into the middle of the line of scrimmage only to see him pop free for a 69-yard scoring romp.</p><p class="">The Cowboys can't handle the run and have been gashed all season. The squad's linebackers have taken a significant step back in overall performance this season. The secondary, meanwhile, is no longer led by Kris Richard with a scheme better suited to maximize the group's skill sets.</p><p id="br-ad-89329696" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">Owner Jerry Jones emphasized hiring a head coach and coaching staff with the type of pedigree to elevate an already talented roster. One side of the ball failed them through the first five weeks of play. Now, the other side should be placed on life support.</p><p class="">"We didn't play very well on offense, defense or special teams. Most importantly, I didn't coach very well" McCarthy <a href="https://twitter.com/jonmachota/status/1318399263123120128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. "I have a continuing issue with ball security on my football team."</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">Michael Ainsworth/Associated Press</p><p class="">But a miracle can still occur. Despite everything, the Cowboys still lead the NFC East with a 2-4 record. With that in mind, the possibility of a legitimate turnaround isn't very good.</p><p class="">Some might point to an easier schedule in the coming weeks. While that's certainly true, what happens when the Cowboys start losing to their division rivals? Don't expect Dallas to sweep through upcoming meetings with the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/washington-football-team">Washington Football Team</a> and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> before ending the season with the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a>. The Cowboys almost certainly won't be able to handle the likes of the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>.</p><p class="">As the current setup continues to crumble, foundational cracks will appear. Dalton's inability to orchestrate the offense at a competent level will come under fire. Elliott's investment in this season could wane. The offensive line won't get much better. The same can be said of the defense. Then, the onus falls on the head coach. For all of Jason Garrett's faults, he only had one losing season during his 10-year tenure.</p><p id="br-ad-37937130" class="br-ad-lazy"></p><p class="">These things can bleed into the offseason when negotiations with Prescott will be renewed. Major investments will be needed throughout the rest of the roster. Dallas doesn't exactly have the <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cap/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial wiggle room</a> to make all of that happen.</p><p class="">The current plight of America's Team can be summed up with one simply cliche, "Hope for the best but expect the worst."</p><p class="">&#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p class="">Brent Sobleski covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.

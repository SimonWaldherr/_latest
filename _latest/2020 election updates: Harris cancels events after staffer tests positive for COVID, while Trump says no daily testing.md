Americans will hear from Donald Trump and Joe Biden on Thursday after all, though not in a debate, and on separate channels with different hosts.

The president and his Democratic challenger will each hold town halls Thursday evening after the second presidential debate was canceled after Trump refused to participate virtually. Both events start at 8 p.m. EDT. Biden is in Philadelphia on ABC with George Stephanopoulos and Trump is in Miami with Savannah Guthrie on NBC, which has come under fire for its decision.

The final presidential debate is still scheduled for Oct. 22 in Nashville.

Expect some town hall discussion to focus on Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's Supreme Court nominee, whose fourth and final day of confirmation hearings is Thursday. The closing hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee will feature legal experts and character witnesses.

‚òï The latest:

üìÜ 19 days until Election Day, seven days until the final presidential debate, 97 days until Inauguration Day, 79 days left in 2020.

McConnell: 'We have the votes' to confirm Barrett, tees up final confirmation for week before election

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday after voting early in Louisville, Kentucky, ‚Äúwe have the votes‚Äù to confirm Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.

The full Senate would start to consider her nomination on Oct. 23, he said, a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on her nomination, which would move the final confirmation vote to the full Senate.

McConnell's pledge to bring Barrett's nomination forward one day after she is likely to clear the Senate Judiciary Committee means the soonest the full Senate could vote to confirm her would be Oct. 26, eight days before Election Day.

"We'll go to the floor with her on Friday, the 23rd and stay on it until we finish this," McConnell said, adding "We have the votes."

Democrats have conceded Republicans have the votes, but have still spent this week asking the judge pointed questions on abortion, voting rights and the Affordable Care Act.

Biden campaign manager: ‚ÄòRace is far closer‚Äô than people on Twitter think

Four years after Democrats were burned by polls, Joe Biden‚Äôs presidential campaign is pushing back at pundits on Twitter who are convinced the former vice president has the inside track against Trump.

Recent polls show Biden has built a double-digit lead nationally and widened his leads in several key battleground states.

Biden campaign manager Jen O‚ÄôMalley Dillon sought to stop any early celebrating and refocus the Biden troops on the work still ahead.

‚Äú[T]here is still a long way to go in this campaign, and we think this race is far closer than folks on this website think. Like a lot closer,‚Äù O‚ÄôMalley Dillon said in a series of tweets Wednesday announcing the campaign‚Äôs record-setting fundraising totals.

Biden‚Äôs polling lead comes four years after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also led national polling and was seen by most election forecasters as the frontrunner.

There are some key differences, however, this year: Biden is more consistently topping 50% in polls than Clinton did. He has larger leads in battleground states. Third-party candidates are getting a smaller share of the vote. There are fewer undecided voters. And Biden has maintained a consistent lead throughout a race that has seen little tightening.

Biden raises $383 million in September, setting a record again

Biden said Wednesday he raised $383 million in campaign funds in September, breaking the one-month record for a presidential candidate that he set the month before.

It leaves the Biden campaign with a robust $432 million on hand less than 20 days before the Nov. 3 election, according to campaign manager Jen O‚ÄôMalley Dillion.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more than I‚Äôve ever raised in my whole life,‚Äù Biden said in a video chat with a supporter posted by the campaign. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really humbled by it.‚Äù

The record-setting fundraising haul comes as the better-financed Biden campaign is already outspending President Donald Trump‚Äôs reelection campaign significantly on television advertising in battleground states.

The fundraising figure is the combination of money raised by the Biden campaign, the Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising efforts.

O‚ÄôMalley Dillon said the campaign raised $203 million through online donations and had 1.1 million new donors last month, raising the number of unique donors to 5.5 million throughout the campaign.

The Trump campaign did not respond to a request seeking Trump‚Äôs fundraising totals for September. The campaign has until Oct. 20 to submit their financial documents to the Federal Election Commission.

In August, Biden raised $364.5 million, shattering the $210 million raised by the Trump campaign by $154.5 million.

Kamala Harris cancels campaign stops after campaign staffer tests positive for COVID-19

Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, canceled campaign trips to key battleground states through Sunday after two people associated with the campaign tested positive for COVID-19.

Harris had planned to campaign Thursday in North Carolina, in Asheville and Charlotte; on Friday in Cleveland; and on Saturday in Pennsylvania, in Allentown and Philadelphia.

The positive tests late Wednesday included a flight crew member, who doesn't work for the campaign, and the senator‚Äôs communications director, Liz Allen, according to Biden campaign manager Jen O‚ÄôMalley Dillon. Harris wasn‚Äôt in close contact with either person within two days of the tests and so faces no obligation to quarantine, Dillon said.

‚ÄúRegardless, out of an abundance of caution and in line with our campaign‚Äôs commitment to the highest levels of precaution, we are canceling Senator Harris‚Äôs travel through Sunday, October 18th,‚Äù Dillon said.

Trump: No daily testing for COVID-19

Two weeks after he tested positive for COVID-19, Trump said Thursday he is not tested for the virus every day.

"Not every day, but I'm tested a lot," Trump said during an interview on Fox Business Network.

Doctors have declared Trump symptom-free, allowing him to return to the campaign trail this week, including scheduled appearances Thursday in the swing states of North Carolina and Florida.

Trump has refused to disclose his testing history before he announced his positive test with a tweet in the early morning hours of Oct. 2. That leaves open the possibility Trump was infected in previous days that included a fundraiser in New Jersey, a rally in Minnesota, and a debate with Biden in Cleveland.

For months, Trump and his aides claimed he was tested every day; since he contracted the virus, they have said he was only tested "regularly."

Trump has a rally in Greenville, N.C., today. During the Fox interview, Trump rejected the notion that the rallies are contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The events are outside, Trump said, and many of his supporters wear masks, citing an event Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa.

"There were many, many people wearing masks," Trump said.

Trump pitches rural voters at Iowa campaign rally

DES MOINES ‚Äì Facing tightening polls with less than three weeks before Election Day, President Donald Trump sought to appeal to rural voters at a campaign rally in Iowa, a state he won handily just four years ago.

"You're a big state to me," Trump told thousands of supporters at Des Moines International Airport.

The president appeared at his third rally in as many days more than a week after he was hospitalized for COVID-19. Trump is looking to close the gap with Biden, who has consistently maintained an edge over the president in national polls and in some key battleground states.

The pair remain locked in a dead heat in Iowa, but the former vice president leads Trump by 6 points in Michigan and Nevada, according to a CBS/YouGov poll taken between Oct. 6-9.

COVID stimulus update: Mnuchin says deal before election would be 'difficult'

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that passing another COVID-19 stimulus package before the election would be ‚Äúdifficult.‚Äù

"I‚Äôd say at this point getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are,‚Äù he said at the Milken Institute Global Conference.

The Republican-controlled Senate is set to act on a roughly $500 billion stimulus proposal next week, an amount rejected by congressional Democrats as insufficient to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The last White House offer of about $1.8 trillion was also rejected by House Democrats, who have held fast to their $2.2 trillion proposal.

Mnuchin met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as part of ongoing stimulus negotiations Wednesday. The two will meet again Thursday.

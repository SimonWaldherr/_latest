  Widow-of-ten Marima Wadisha screamed, threw rocks and in her desperation even fired bullets at the locusts that descended on her sorghum fields in northeast Ethiopia.But the insect swarms were so relentless that her entire crop -- her family's only source of income -- was destroyed.We are left with an empty harvest, we tie our waist and cry day and night.How can (I) feed ... my children like this," she said, surrounded by five of them as she held a bundle of damaged sorghum.The locust invasion is Ethiopia's worst in 25 years, United Nations food agency FAO says.

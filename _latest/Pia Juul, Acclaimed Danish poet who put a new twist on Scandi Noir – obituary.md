<div><p>Martin Aitken, who translated the novel into English, described the book as an &#8220;inspired twist on the whole wave of Scandi crime&#8221;, noting that it was indicative of Pia Juul&#8217;s approach to writing that she should &#8220;focus on the perplexed grief of the bereaved, rather than on the more familiar whodunnit aspect&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crime fiction novels are so different, you can&#8217;t really say that there are any rules,&#8221; Pia Juul explained. &#8220;What I set out to do was to write a novel that was situated in the outskirts of the real crime-fiction novel. So this book then should be about the widow, and not about the crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was equally unapologetic about her lack of a revelation at the end of the book, observing that she, at least, knew who killed Halland. &#8220;Sometimes people think that authors want to make a riddle just to annoy you, but that&#8217;s not the way it is,&#8221; she noted. Pia Juul was born on May 30 1962 in the town of Korsor on the Danish island of Zealand. Her parents, Kurt and Inge, were writers and teachers in a local folk high school. The family moved to the Himmerland region of Jutland when Pia was six.</p>
<p>After graduating from Hobro Gymnasium in the early 1980s, she enrolled at Aarhus University to read English but dropped out after 18 months. Her first of seven collection of poems levende og lukket (alive and closed) appeared in 1985. Her elegant short poems exploring the lives of women were considered an exciting development in Danish literature.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen&#8217;s literary set, Pia Juul was known for her kindness. The publisher Asgner Schnack recalled that &#8220;she didn&#8217;t let a young poet stand alone at a party or at a reading. She went over to her or him and started a conversation. Even though, or because, she was the greatest poet of her generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>She published one other novel, a radio play, several children&#8217;s books and three collections of short stories. And, in addition to Ted Hughes&#8217; poetry, Pia Juul worked on Danish translations of Ali Smith&#8217;s fiction and the philosophical works of Alain de Botton.</p>
<p>The Murder of Halland won Denmark&#8217; most important literary prize, Den Danske Banks litteraturpris, and, in translation, was nominated for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize. Pia Juul recognised that the fashion for Scandinavian crime novels provided her with a springboard. &#8220;It helps,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;The Killing helps as well, you know. The fact that I was Danish made me interesting. They want to see if I [am] wearing a sweater.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pia Juul was unmarried. She is survived by two daughters.</p>

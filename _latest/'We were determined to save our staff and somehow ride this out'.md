<div><p>Delaunay general manager Michelle Chillingworth says bookings for dinner later in the week and this weekend are strong, with lots of regulars looking forward to coming back. The restaurant could seat about 180 people pre-Covid, although that number is now down to about 120.</p>
<p>Your fearless correspondent is pleased to report that the Delaunay serves an excellent rib eye steak and fries, while another diner nearby seemed very pleased indeed with the confit of duck. Also on the menu are dishes such as Chicken Schnitzel and Steak Tartare, although the chargrilled spiced cauliflower steak does give vegetarians at least one main course option.</p>
<p>One patron asked the waiter if he could take his slice of black forest gateau home; I was quite happy to polish off my baked vanilla cheesecake there and then, however.&#160;</p>
<p>Chillingworth says many customers are confused about who is allowed to dine with whom under the latest restrictions.&#160;</p>
<p>King argues that establishments such as the Delaunay and Wolseley can only survive if the Government confirms that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/working-lunches-pub-could-exempt-lockdown-restrictions/">business meetings are a legitimate reason to dine indoors</a> at a restaurant with people from different households. If ministers fail to heed his call, the hospitality sector will hope he is proved wrong.</p>

And he wasn&#8217;t about to risk getting his young family sick.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Dodgers opted into the World Series, finishing with the National League&#8217;s best record, and now are vying for their first championship since 1988, without Price.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Dodgers pitcher David Price sits in the dugout during spring training in February."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Price, who won&#8217;t lie and say he that he never had second thoughts on his decision, misses that clubhouse environment. He&#8217;s on the text strand with the rest of his teammates, and offers words of encouragement and joins the banter, but it&#8217;s not the same.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Maybe if the Miami Marlins&#8217; and St. Louis Cardinals&#8217; outbreaks hadn&#8217;t happened so quickly after the start of the season, he might have changed his mind, too, just like Atlanta outfielder Nick Markakis, who opted out, changed his mind, and rejoined his Braves teammates.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I&#8217;m definitely missing it, but I&#8217;m at peace with my decision,&#8217;&#8217; Price said. &#8220;What I missed the most is the competition, being in the clubhouse, being in the dugout, picking someone up after a rough game or week, having them come over to my room, and forgetting baseball.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;But with a 3-year-old son, a 1-year-old daughter, I&#8217;ve got to watch them grow. That&#8217;s a time I would have missed out on, and very thankful to be at home with them. I&#8217;m a fan. Those guys know I&#8217;m watching and pulling for them.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">'I didn't think there was any way':</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2020/10/19/dodgers-rays-how-did-mlb-pull-world-series-pandemic/5983711002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">How did MLB pull off the World Series?</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Just like '88?:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2020/10/19/world-series-dodgers-aim-piggyback-lakers-winning-title/3708358001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Dodgers winning World Series would also give LA its first 'double-double' since 1988</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Price, who was a rookie on the&#160;2008 Rays&#160;team that last went to the World Series, got a text message from Rays ace Blake Snell asking him who he was pulling for. He laughed, knowing he pulled for the Rays to reach the World Series, and will always be indebted to them for believing in him, drafting him out of Vanderbilt and helping him become a star.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We&#8217;re paying his checks, at least most of his checks,&#8217;&#8217; Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said, &#8220;I hope he&#8217;s rooting for us.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Yes, Price is officially a Dodger, traded with Mookie Betts from the Boston Red Sox in February.&#160;This will be the teammates'&#160;second World Series together, only Price won't be present in person for this one.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Everyone in a Dodger uniform wishes he was here,&#8217;&#8217; Betts said. &#8220;We talk probably three or four times a week, he texts me after games, he pretty much texts the whole team. That's the kind of teammate he is, and that&#8217;s what he brings to the clubhouse.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Price, who twice beat the Dodgers in the 2018 World Series &#8211; pitching on short rest and outdueling Clayton Kershaw in the Red Sox's clinching Game 5&#160;&#8211;&#160;never thought there would be a 2020 season. He believed that COVID-19 would shut it down before it even started, and if it started, it wouldn&#8217;t last.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;The players, trainers, staff and organizations,&#8217;&#8217; Price said, &#8220;have done a very good job of doing this the right way. That is something that had to happen for this season to take place.&#8217;&#8217;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="David Price during spring training in February."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Opting out saw Price staying home all summer, in the scorching sun of Arizona, where he bought Los Angeles Angels outfielder Justin Upton&#8217;s former home, watching baseball game after baseball game.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;It was a different year to say the least,&#8217;&#8217; Price said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had fun watching baseball on TV. It&#8217;s by far the most baseball I&#8217;ve watched in my life. Seeing different teams, all of the young talent, I don&#8217;t think baseball has ever had as much young talent.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-baseball-mlb-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Certainly, he missed his teammates, the camaraderie and the competition, but with no fans and teams sequestered in hotels these past five weeks, he questioned just how much fun everyone else was having this season.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I could see it on guys&#8217; faces, I could see it on TV,&#8217;&#8217; Price said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t as enjoyable as what professional baseball is, and always has been. I don&#8217;t think it was as much fun.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I really enjoy the fans in the stands. You feed off that energy so much. It was a different game this year, but I think the players adjusted really well.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Still, there was no doubt in his mind, he said, that if there were a season, the Dodgers would be sitting right here in the World Series. Even when they were down 3-1 to the Atlanta Braves, he saw the exchange of text messages on the Dodgers&#8217; group chat, and knew they never lost hope. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/playoffs/2020/10/18/dodgers-braves-nlcs-game-7-mlb-playoffs/3707698001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">They always believed they would pull it out</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I was so happy for them,&#8217;&#8217; Price aid. &#8220;It was so cool to see (Cody)&#160;Bellinger have the game he had. He didn&#8217;t have the regular season or even the postseason he wanted, but one swing changes everything.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Now, the Rays are the last team standing in the Dodgers&#8217; way, the team that first believed in Price&#160;and the one he&#8217;ll forever be indebted to for everything they helped him become in this game.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;They helped groove and mold me,&#8217;&#8217; Price said, &#8220;into the pitcher and person I am today. I&#8217;ll forever be grateful for my time in Tampa, to be part of what they started until the time I left.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;There&#8217;s only one player left on the team (center fielder Kevin Kiermaier)&#160;when I was there, but even though they have different guys now, they still have that feeling, the culture and belief&#160;they can win.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;This is going to be a fun World Series.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Believe me, I&#8217;ll be watching.&#8217;&#8217;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Follow Bob Nightengale on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/BNightengale" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">@BNightengale</a>.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/mlb/2020/10/11/mlb-playoffs-photos-best-shots-conference-series/5963628002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

Like millions of students across the country, the class of 2020 at Clayton High School in Missouri navigated a turbulent end to the school year. In mid-March, the coronavirus pandemic suspended in-person classes at the public high school about a 20-minute drive from St. Louis, and students began virtual learning on March 23. Sports seasons and extracurricular activities were cut short, and a socially distanced graduation ceremony was held in late June.

Through it all, Clayton's seniors completed their college search and decision-making process. The school is home to around 900 students, about 97% of whom typically continue their education after graduation. Some 60% of students are white, 20% are Black, 13% are Asian and 4% are Hispanic. Around 28% of students take Advanced Placement classes, and more than 90% of those pass their AP exams.

U.S. News spoke with eight recent Clayton grads about their college searches and collected advice they had to share.

Mason Sharon

(Ria Sharon)

Whether starring as the Wicked Witch of the West in "The Wizard of Oz," performing in the dance ensemble or serving as theater house manager, Mason Sharon made it a point to be involved in school performances. And she settled on studying theater education in college.

She was accepted by all and eventually settled on Ball State, a public institution of about 16,000 undergrads in Muncie. When Sharon stepped on campus the first time for a visit, she "loved everything about it so much." She likes that the program is "super well-oiled" and that students are assured they will get into the classes they need to graduate in eight semesters.

GPA: 3.5

ACT: 30

Extracurriculars: Theater, vice president of the thespian troupe, president of show choir, feminist club, founder of the creative writing club; worked at a local ice cream shop and candy store

Essay: None required.

Good move: Whenever her family took a vacation, they would plan to visit colleges in the area. She advises setting up appointments with department heads, financial aid counselors and others. "Figure out what you want and then ask about it."

Cost: Ball State awarded her an annual merit scholarship of about $14,000, and she earned another scholarship from an organization supporting those studying theater education. Sharon's mom works at Washington University in St. Louis, and the school will provide a partial tuition remission benefit. Her family will shoulder the rest of Ball State's roughly $27,000 out-of-state tuition and fees.

Lailah Hall

(Leonard Whilby)

Originally, Lailah Hall had her sights set on a traditional business degree. But the summer before senior year, her interest in food insecurity and disparities between communities caused her to narrow her focus to agribusiness.

Hall dreams of owning her own farm or being otherwise involved in the food industry. "I'm not totally sure yet, but (my future) has something to do with food manufacturing and food production," she says. "I like food a lot!"

GPA: 3.6

ACT: 30

Extracurriculars: Volleyball junior varsity player and varsity manager, president of the Black Student Union, student council, treasurer of Best Buddies (dedicated to creating opportunities for students with disabilities), board member of Clayton Conversations, Chinese Culture Club, feminist club

Essay: The one that helped her secure a spot at Florida A&M was focused on how her own family deals with food insecurity in metropolitan St. Louis, where she says many residents lack access to healthy and affordable meals.

Advice: Be involved and do productive things during high school that can enhance your resume. Be a club leader, not just "a member."

Cost: Hall will cover her $17,000-plus in out-of-state tuition at Florida A&M through the various merit scholarships she has earned.

Koji Barrette

(Keiko Hirose)

Having been a competitive swimmer since first grade, Koji Barrette found the question of whether he'd pursue athletics in college to be a huge decision. He saw success on Clayton's team, finishing in the top five at a state meet and qualifying for a junior national meet, which was canceled due to COVID-19. "That was my greatest dilemma: Did I want to swim in college?"

To cover his bases, Barrette spoke with coaches and applied to schools where he could swim as well as ones where he couldn't. His only in-state selection was WashU, where his parents are faculty physicians. In total he applied to 15 schools, sending early applications to Pomona College in California, Case Western Reserve University in Ohio and WashU.

His first two decisions were a rejection from Pomona and a deferral from Case Western. WashU accepted his early decision application and he withdrew all others. "I had found my true love in a school," he says.

Barrette wants to go into a medical field like his parents, most likely pediatrics, and is considering majoring in chemistry or biochemistry. He thinks the chances of swimming with the university's NCAA Division III team are "quite low" but plans to pursue swimming through club athletics.

GPA: 3.81

ACT: 34

Extracurriculars: Varsity swimming, played French horn in the concert and symphonic bands as well as trumpet in jazz band and mellophone in pep band, volunteered for a swimming program for youth with disabilities

Essay: Barrette wrote about a three-week summer program in which he rode a bicycle nearly 550 miles from Eugene, Oregon, to San Francisco, camping along the way. For a supplemental essay, he wrote about being half Japanese on his mother's side and how Japanese culture has always been hugely important to him.

Advice: "When you're searching for colleges, don't stress so much about a specific major," he says. "The next four years could change your mind several different times over."

Cost: Since his parents are both employed by WashU, he will receive a benefit that will totally cover his tuition.

Jillian Beck

At first, Jillian Beck had her sights set on a historically Black college or the University of Missouri. She applied to Mizzou, Jackson State University in Mississippi, Langston University in Oklahoma and Alabama State University. She was initially wait-listed at some places, but in the end accepted by all.

Beck planned to attend Mizzou, but then had some discussions with her parents about her long-term plans. She began looking into community college in an effort to save money in the early years and set herself up for the most prosperous possible educational and financial future.

With some help from her guidance counselor, Beck found that her grades and test scores qualified her for the A+ Program, which will pay her way through community college. After she earns her associate degree, she plans to transfer to a four-year school, probably Mizzou. At St. Charles Community College, a half-hour from home, she'll study psychology.

Initially, she says, "I felt like there wouldn't be excitement in me 'going to college' two years later." But COVID-19 gave her family pause. "We weren't sure if I'd be having normal classes and still paying that much – it just didn't make sense to us."

GPA: 3.42

ACT: 24

Extracurriculars: Varsity volleyball, track and field, soccer, Girl Scout for 13 years

Essay: Beck didn't have to write essays.

Good move: Going to a college fair, which she did prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Beck got to talk to a number of college reps, which gave her a feel for how the schools differed from each other.

Advice: "Don't focus on how others view where you want to go," she says.

Rosalinda Christopher

(Josefina Christopher)

Above all else, Rosalinda Christopher was focused on finding the right fit in a college. She credits her parents with giving her that guidance. "You should listen to the adults around you who give you advice about what they went through," she says, adding that her parents "went to Saint Louis University here, and my parents turned out great."

Christopher didn't want to go to a huge university, but she didn't want to go to a tiny school either. She applied to a number of smaller and medium-sized colleges, including SLU, Creighton University in Nebraska, and the University of Dayton and Xavier University in Ohio.

She was accepted by all and ultimately chose Xavier. Her experiences when touring the private Jesuit university in Cincinnati really struck a chord. The message was "that it's not about the grades, it's more about the person," she says.

GPA: 3.63

ACT: 24

Extracurriculars: Played clarinet in the band, managed the volleyball team, completed community service hours, volunteered with children with disabilities

Essay: Christopher chose to write about a severe knee injury – a torn ACL and meniscus – caused by a fall during gym class. She needed surgery, and her recovery was hampered when a second fall reinjured her knee and required another procedure.

Good move: Don't get caught up in thinking you have to go to the "best" schools or schools where your friends are going. "Find the place that fits you best."

Regrets: "I would've probably joined more clubs in high school, just to get a feel of different things," she says. She also wishes that she had started thinking about college more thoroughly during junior year.

Cost: She received a renewable scholarship, but most of her $42,460 tuition expenses will be shouldered by her parents. She doesn't expect to graduate with debt.

Sarah Jane Baker

(Walter Cronkite School/ASU)

Even before she knew where she would be going to college, Sarah Jane Baker spent a lot of time applying for institutional scholarships. That advance planning paid off when she got the news that she'd been awarded the Belk Scholarship at Davidson College in North Carolina, her No. 1 choice.

Even before she received the Belk, Baker knew she wanted to end up at Davidson. "I could just see how much the school cared about people," she says, pointing especially to how the liberal arts college handled the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Davidson announced that students and families could have the option of deferring their tuition payment for up to one year while still attending classes.

"I think how a school deals with that kind of crisis really says something," Baker says.

She was invited to participate in "Belk Weekend," an opportunity for all candidates for the scholarship to travel to campus to tour and meet people. The pandemic put a stop to those plans, but Baker appreciated that Davidson offered a virtual weekend instead.

GPA: 3.8

ACT: 31

Extracurriculars: Baker helped found Clayton's Best Buddies chapter; participated in Challenger Baseball for people with disabilities; became a certified sex educator with Planned Parenthood's Teen Advocates for Sexual Health; volunteered at her synagogue in the homeless outreach program; worked at Noodles & Company

Essay: She wrote about how her role with Planned Parenthood taught her to use her voice for advocacy and how her Best Buddies experience taught her to help other people be heard.

Good move: Getting applications in as early as possible to reduce stress. Soon after senior year started, she began writing her Common Application essay and preparing early action applications.

Regrets: Underestimating the amount of time and effort required to apply to so many schools. "My applications were on time but cramming on applications or essays is tough."

Advice: Don't be afraid to let go of things that aren't bringing meaning to your life. She made the careful decision to stop playing field hockey to spend her time on Planned Parenthood and Best Buddies.

Cost: As a Belk Scholar, her expenses will be covered. Plus, she'll receive two $3,000 special study stipends. One past Belk Scholar used the stipend to go to Guatemala for a photojournalism project; another spent a summer in South Africa at an innovation lab focusing on local shelter problems.

Brooke Becker

(Dana L. Becker)

During her early high school years, Brooke Becker quietly began her college search while tagging along on her older sister's campus tours. Her sister ended up at Arizona State University, but Becker wasn't sure that would be quite the right fit for her.

Still, she was leaning toward a larger school with a strong honors college and engineering program. She ended up applying to Arizona State, Colorado State University, Michigan State University, Indiana University, Purdue University in Indiana, Ohio State University, the University of South Carolina and the University of Missouri. She was accepted everywhere, often with an honors college spot.

Because the COVID-19 pandemic limited touring opportunities, Becker found her decision-making tougher. She resorted to taking virtual tours and finding other ways to make comparisons. Her experiences touring with her sister had given her an idea of where she would be happy, and she ended up picking close-to-home Mizzou. "Everybody applies there," Becker says. "My dad was like, 'You've got to apply to Mizzou, just in case.' Thank goodness I did."

Along with the diversity of Mizzou's student body, affordability played a big role in her choice. She will be studying mechanical engineering.

GPA: 3.71

SAT: 1320

Extracurriculars: Varsity volleyball captain, varsity diving, Chinese Culture Club president, National Honor Society, Society of Women Engineers, principal's advisory council; worked at Flying Tiger Motorcycles; volunteered at a local pet shop's cat adoption events; community organizer. Becker participated in a climate change walkout at Clayton, a reproductive rights protest and the Black Lives Matter movement.

Essay: "My mom's half-Black and half-white, and my dad's white," she says. She wrote about experiencing microaggressions based on society's perceiving her as Black – unlike her sisters, who are seen as white – and how she grew from those experiences.

Regrets: Thinking the ACT was her only option and not trying the SAT earlier, which ended up being a better fit for her. "If one test doesn't work for you, try the other test."

Advice: "I definitely would recommend talking to a senior who has recently gone through all this." She also suggests talking to coaches, family friends or anyone with a connection to a recent or current college student to learn about their experiences.

Cost: She'll be paying for a portion of her $12,600 in-state tuition with a $3,500 scholarship from Mizzou. Her parents will cover the rest, but she plans to contribute herself if costs rise.

Emilio Rosas Linhard

(Israel Martinez)

Growing up as the son of two professors at WashU, Emilio Rosas Linhard got a clear sense of the college experience but didn't grow up with a "dream school" in mind.

His first instinct was to apply to WashU, given the tuition benefits for children of employees. But he ended up realizing he wanted to go somewhere away from home. He toured the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while visiting family in Boston, and he did a fly-in program at Rice University in Texas. During the summer before senior year, he spent three weeks at a University of Chicago academic session.

Rosas Linhard ended up applying early action to UChicago, MIT, Tulane University in Louisiana and the University of Miami. He also sent applications to WashU, Rice, Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and a joint program between Columbia University in New York and a school in France.

He was wait-listed at MIT, deferred at Tulane, rejected by the Columbia joint program and accepted everywhere else.

UChicago's acceptance was the first to arrive, and it came with a sizable merit scholarship. He and his family concluded that they could afford it and that UChicago felt like the best fit; its core curriculum appealed since he wasn't settled on what he wanted to study. He's interested in the social sciences and maybe economics, and he has known for sure that he wants to study German since he visited Berlin – his mother's hometown – back in eighth grade.

GPA: 4.18

ACT: 35

Extracurriculars: Varsity cross-country and track, captain and board member of the speech and debate team, science and engineering academic teams, co-founder of the Latin American Culture Club, Clayton Connect volunteer tutor for elementary students, worked as a host at a brunch restaurant

Essay: Rosas Linhard appreciated UChicago's creative essay prompts, and he chose one instructing him to pick any program at the school and remove or add a letter to its title. He changed the program "big problems" to "pig problems" and wrote about a pig attending the university. For his more traditional Common App essay, he wrote about his name and its blended history. He was born in Mexico City to a Mexican father and a German mother prior to moving to Clayton before his second birthday.

Regrets: "I think I should've spent more time finding things I truly enjoy and spent more time with friends," he says. That said, he's happy with his time at Clayton and thinks he struck a good balance; he wasn't constantly up until 3 a.m. studying, but also wasn't one to shrug off academic responsibilities.

Advice: Focus on quality over quantity. Rosas Linhard thinks it is clear when college applicants spread themselves too thin across activities. He says he's very happy about his development in cross-country and track, "but with speech and debate, I think I could've chilled out a little bit." Don't make your entire high school experience focused on getting into college, he says.

Cost: With help from his parents and the tuition benefit for kids of WashU faculty, plus merit scholarships from UChicago, his tuition of roughly $59,300 will be covered with no loans. Rosas Linhard says he plans to find a job once he's settled in at UChicago to earn some money and help out with fees and other expenses where he can.

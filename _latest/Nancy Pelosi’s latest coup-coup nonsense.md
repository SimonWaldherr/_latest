House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says her team is “going to be talking about the 25th Amendment” on Friday — the latest in a long line of nutty Democratic fantasies of getting rid of President Trump.

Pelosi, who hasn’t actually talked to the prez in months, claims to think he’s mentally off thanks to his COVID-19 treatments (or something). Yet she’s only exposing (again) Democrats’ own Trump Derangement Syndrome, because this potential coup is an obvious non-starter.

Trump’s “disassociation from reality would be funny if it weren’t so deadly,” she claimed — just because he’s made his usual fast-changing threats and offers over the relief bill that Democrats have stalled in Congress.

The 25th Amendment allows for temporary ouster of a disabled president, but it requires the active participation of a majority of his Cabinet — or the Republican Senate’s assent to setting up some other body to rule on his fitness. The prez just gave an hour-long interview to Maria Bartiromo — pretty compelling proof that he’s clicking on all cylinders. And there is no provision for removing a president just because Pelosi is offended by his existence.

Pelosi’s noise follows a host of forlorn Democratic get-Trump plans, which hit their apex with her ramshackle impeachment show early this year — even as the coronavirus was quietly hitting these shores.

The kookie conspiracies go all the way back to late 2016, when Dems tried to organize enough “faithless electors” to give Hillary Clinton an Electoral College majority.

More direly, various Obamaites at the same time concocted the “Russian collusion” fantasy — ginning up an utterly phony Trump-Putin plot to steal the 2016 election. That one burned up endless White House time and fed vast left-wing paranoia, for years.

The flip side of this madness is liberals’ endless whining about their supposed fears for an “orderly transition” if Trump loses in November — even as Hillary Clinton publicly advises Joe Biden to never concede defeat. That presages a national version of 2018 losing Georgia candidate Stacey Abrams’ years-long insistence that she actually won.

Sorry, Nancy: It’s Democrats’ delusions that would be “funny” if they weren’t so deadly.

Padres outfielder Tommy Pham is in good condition and expected to make a full recovery after police said he was stabbed in the lower back Sunday night outside a San Diego strip club.

The 32-year-old was leaving the establishment when he asked two arguing strangers to move away from his car, San Diego Police department said, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

That’s when he was stabbed, the newspaper reported, citing sources who spoke with Pham.

Pham needed stitches to repair the wound that pierced all three layers of skin but didn’t damage any organs, according to police.

“While it was a very traumatic and eye-opening experience for me, I’m on the road to recovery and I know I’ll be back to my offseason training routine in no time,” Pham said in a statement.

A spokesman for the San Diego Police department, which is investigating the incident, said it did not appear Pham knew the suspects, who remain at large.

The up-and-coming Padres were eliminated by the Dodgers in the NLDS last week. Pham appeared in all three games, and had three hits in 11 at-bats.

In 31 games during the shortened 60-game regular season, Pham hit .211/.312/.312 with three home runs and 12 RBIs.

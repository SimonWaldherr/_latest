Boris Johnson is due to announce a new three-tier local lockdown system for England on Monday.

Every area will be put in one of three tiers under the plan - and the worst-hit could see pubs shut down, shielding resume and a ban on non-essential travel.

The PM's aides have spent this weekend locked in talks with local leaders and was holding a phone conference with his Cabinet on Sunday afternoon.

But some of the key decisions were still being thrashed out hours before his Monday afternoon address to the House of Commons.

And Tory ministers were locked in a stand-off with local leaders who said there must be more wage support before their pubs are shut down.

The Tory leader of Bolton Council united with Greater Manchester's Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, and other northern leaders to urge the wage package to be improved.

Yet Tory Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick batted aside calls to raise the cash saying: "We canâ€™t do everything."

So what is Boris Johnson due to announce tomorrow - and more importantly, how will it affect you? Here's what we know.

What will Boris Johnson announce?

The Prime Minister will give an update to Parliament after 3.30pm on the government's fight against coronavirus.

He is expected to unveil a three-tier local lockdown system.

This has two purposes - to replace the confusing mish-mash of local rules, and to slap harder rules on parts of England where the virus is running rampant.

This will see every area in England placed into one of three tiers depending on how bad the virus is.

The new system will reportedly be called Local Covid Alert Levels - and they're unlikely to resemble a traffic light.

Rather than having a green 'low-risk' option, the tiers are expected to be labelled 'medium', 'high', or 'very high'.

Boris Johnson is also expected to hand more control to councils over contact-tracing after the privatised NHS Test and Trace failed to tell thousands to isolate.

And northern leaders want him to announce a new wage package - more of this below.

It will standardise the mish-mash system of local lockdowns in England so they're easier to understand.

At the moment, more than 50 areas in England are under a confusing array of local lockdown rules.

For example in Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham it's illegal to meet someone you don't live with in a private home or garden.

But what about in the pub? In Liverpool that's illegal; in Manchester it's against advice, and in Birmingham it's allowed, as long as you're not in a group of more than six people.

Under the new system, you'll just need to look up which tier you live in and check the rules from there.

However, there might still be some specific measures for local areas even on top of what's being announced.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said areas will have the "flexibility" to go further or come up with particular measures beyond the three tier system.

What happens in Tier 1?

Tier 1 is for the least-hit areas, and is expected to reflect the current national rules for England. These include:

Rule of six: Social gatherings of more than six people outdoors or indoors are illegal.

Social gatherings of more than six people outdoors or indoors are illegal. 10pm curfew: Pubs and restaurants can only operate with table service and must shut by 10pm.

Pubs and restaurants can only operate with table service and must shut by 10pm. Work from home if you can: People who can do their job from home are expected to do so.

People who can do their job from home are expected to do so. Social distancing: Stay 2m apart from people not in your household or bubble, or 1m with mitigations.

What happens in Tier 2?

Tier 2 is for higher-risk areas, and is expected to reflect current local lockdown rules that already apply to more than 10million people in England. This could include:

Everything in Tier 1, plus:

plus: Indoor gatherings banned: Social gatherings are not allowed indoors between anyone who doesn't live together (other than bubbles and exemptions).

Social gatherings are not allowed indoors between anyone who doesn't live together (other than bubbles and exemptions). Public transport cut: People are only advised to use public transport for essential reasons.

What happens in Tier 3?

Tier 3 is for the highest-risk areas, and is expected to go much further than the current local lockdown rules.

Details are still being thrashed out between ministers and councils, but leaks suggest it might include:

Everything in Tiers 1 and 2, plus:

plus: Pubs and restaurants shut: Mayors expect pubs in these areas to be closed by law. There is speculation restaurants may be able to remain open until 10pm.

Mayors expect pubs in these areas to be closed by law. There is speculation restaurants may be able to remain open until 10pm. Hairdressers and leisure centres shut: Reports suggest the closure of beauty salons and sports centres is up for discussion, but it's not decided.

Reports suggest the closure of beauty salons and sports centres is up for discussion, but it's not decided. Casinos and bookies closed: Reports suggest Tier 3 measures for Liverpool will shut this venues too.

Reports suggest Tier 3 measures for Liverpool will shut this venues too. Non-essential travel banned: People may be advised against travelling in, out or within the area unless for purposes like work or school.

People may be advised against travelling in, out or within the area unless for purposes like work or school. No mixing outdoors: Reports suggest mixing between people who don't live together could be banned in all settings, even outdoors.

Reports suggest mixing between people who don't live together could be banned in all settings, even outdoors. Shielding resumes: Reports suggested the clinically vulnerable in these areas might be asked to shield again for the first time since August. No funding to help them do so has yet been confirmed.

But schools and workplaces stay open: Ministers have made clear schools will be the last thing to shut.

What tier am I in?

By and large we can't tell you yet.

A full list of tiers for each area of England should - we hope - be announced around the time of the Prime Minister's statement. But no one can agree (more below).

The only areas where we know are ones where the local council or mayor have said what tier they expect to be.

Liverpool City Region is set to be among the first areas to enter Tier 3 this week - but other areas including Greater Manchester were still locked in talks with the government on Sunday.

Even once tiers are agreed there might not be a clear way to know when you're going to move up or down.

The key measure is the number of new cases per 100,000 people in the last week.

But that's not the only thing the government will look at - it'll also study the hospitalisation rate, the growth rate of the virus, and whether the figures are skewed by one specific outbreak like a factory or university.

For now, you can search the lockdown rules for your area below.

Why can't anyone agree?

Northern leaders are demanding extra help for workers whose businesses are shut down or left unviable.

Under a scheme announced on Friday, anyone whose venue is forcibly closed down can get two-thirds of their normal wages paid by the state from November 1.

But local leaders, including the Tory leader of Bolton Council, want this to rise from 67% to the 80% like in the original furlough scheme.

Critics also warn the scheme leaves a million workers high and dry in industries that are as good as shut down by Covid, but haven't actually been closed by law.

Greater Manchester metro mayor Andy Burnham said: "If there is to be any form of lockdown, it has to come with the same support that was provided earlier this year."

The worst-hit areas of England that are most at risk of Tier 3 lockdown

Below is a list of areas which all have more than 200 new cases per 100,000 people.

This doesn't mean these areas will go into the highest tier - it just means they're more at risk than other areas.

We don't know yet which areas will be in which tier.

The following list reads: name of local authority; rate of new cases in the seven days to October 6; number (in brackets) of new cases recorded in the seven days to October 6; rate of new cases in the seven days to September 29; number (in brackets) of new cases recorded in the seven days to September 29.

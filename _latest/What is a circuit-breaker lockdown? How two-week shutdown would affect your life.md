Pressure is mounting on Boris Johnson to hit the whole of England with a sharp two-week 'circuit-breaker' lockdown.

Labour and his own scientific advisors are calling for the move, which would shut shops and restaurants, order people to stay at home like in March, and go far further than the three-tier local lockdown regime he announced this week.

Boris Johnson has attacked Labour for making the call, and today pleaded with MPs: "Let us try to avoid the misery of another national lockdown."

But he has also not ruled out a circuit-breaker. And a YouGov poll today showed 68% would support the move during this month's school half term - with just 20% opposed.

Even 65% of Tory voters backed one, compared to 76% of Labour voters and 75% of Lib Dems, despite the idea being strongly approved by Conservative MPs.

So as we hurtle towards one, despite the reservations of the Prime Minister, we've looked at why this is being suggested and what it would mean.

What is a circuit-breaker lockdown?

A 'circuit-breaker' is a full-blown lockdown to interrupt rising virus rates - but time limited for two or three weeks.

Government advisors SAGE put the idea at the top of a five-measure shortlist that "should be considered for immediate introduction" in a meeting on September 21.

SAGE did not list everything that should shut in a circuit-breaker, but hoped it would be as "strict and well-adhered to as the restrictions in late May".

That would mean pubs, bars and restaurants would be closed but compensated. You'd be banned from mixing with anyone not in your household or bubble and told to stay at home as much as possible.

Only essential work and travel would be allowed, people would work from home if they can (as they already are), non-essential offices and shops would close, and people would be told not to go on holiday.

A circuit-break would, if possible, be timed to run across half-term to minimise disruption to schools. But SAGE admitted "home schooling IT equipment" may be needed.

Where would a circuit-breaker happen?

The suggestion - including from Labour - is it would be national across the whole of England. Wales' government is calling for it to be UK-wide.

This would mean it would override England's new three-tier local lockdown system at a stroke - albeit temporarily.

The Telegraph reports there is also an option for a local circuit break - which would effectively be a 'Tier 3.5' or a 'Tier 4' under the current system.

The idea is just to have one circuit-break to set the disease back 28 days. But SAGE also admitted: "Multiple circuit-breaks might be necessary to maintain low levels of incidence."

Apart from a full indefinite lockdown, it is the only credible option that the government's advisors are confident would bring the R rate below 1.

Bringing R below 1 is the only way to ensure the number of new infections falls each day, instead of rising as it is now.

SAGE said a circuit-breaker of two to three weeks was "likely to have similar levels of effectiveness as national lockdown in Spring", albeit only temporarily.

Such a stay-at-home order could "put the epidemic back 28 days and could significantly reduce the prevalence of infection in December", SAGE said.

This is because what would have been two weeks of growth will be swapped for two weeks of decline.

A new paper by Graham Medley, a SAGE member, and Matt Keeling, of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, reportedly found between 3,000 and 107,000 deaths could be avoided by January if it was imposed.

And SAGE on September 21 predicted the fall in deaths "would be maintained for several months and could be very substantial".

When would it happen?

Any circuit-breaker seems vanishingly unlikely to happen this week or even next week, unless Boris Johnson stages a colossal U-turn.

That's because the PM is trying to make his three-tier system of local lockdowns work first (more below).

But Labour's Keir Starmer is calling for it to happen now, and SAGE have said the sooner it happens, the less likely it is we'll need even more restrictions.

SAGE warned of its five-measure shortlist: "The more rapidly these interventions are put in place the greater the reduction in COVID-related deaths and the quicker they can be eased."

The school half-term is at the end of this month. Aligning a circuit-breaker with the school holidays would minimise disruption but is very soon.

Labour's leader said he was spurred into action by SAGE documents suggesting a circuit-breaker lockdown.

He said a circuit-breaker would "buy" the government time to get a grip on testing and hand over track and trace to local public health teams.

In a direct plea to the Prime Minister, Labour's leader said a circuit-break would be an "opportunity to reset and rectify some of the mistakes the government has made", and "this was not inevitable, but it is now necessary."

He told Boris Johnson: "You know that the scientific evidence backs this approach. You know the restrictions you introduced won’t be enough. You know a circuit break is needed now to get this virus under control.

"You can’t keep delaying this and coming back to the House of Commons every few weeks with another plan that won’t work. So act now - break the cycle."

What would it cost the economy?

The financial cost of the first lockdown was ruinous - billions per week - and for a circuit-break to work similar measures would have to be put in place.

Neither the government nor Labour have said what a circuit-break would cost.

But the Prime Minister's official spokesman appeared to hint that government officials have modelled the costs of such a lockdown.

Asked if they had, he told journalists: "Ministers have received advice from the government chief economist and that will continue to be the case as we move forward in dealing with the pandemic."

Keir Starmer failed to say what a circuit-breaker might cost but insisted: "The cost of not doing this is going to far exceed the cost of doing it."

Boris Johnson's officials insist there is a good reason he ignored the scientific advice - because he has to consider the economic impact too.

Reports suggest Chancellor Rishi Sunak persuaded Boris Johnson not to enter a circuit-breaker due to the cost to the economy.

Boris Johnson has pointed repeatedly to a note in the SAGE paper which says: "Policy makers will need to consider analysis of economic impacts and the associated harms alongside this epidemiological assessment."

SAGE also said a circuit-breaker would have a "moderate negative impact" on society, with the "risk of division and anger in community" if children's education were to suffer.

The Prime Minister is doubling down, insisting his three-tier local lockdown system is the "right way forward".

It's a far cry from his claim on May 11 that "we will be governed entirely by the science".

Yet Mr Johnson has also admitted he is not actually ruling out a circuit-break lockdown in future, and the Telegraph reports it has an "80%" chance of happening.

When Sir Keir asked if that was true, the PM replied: "I rule out nothing of course in combatting the virus.

“But we are going to do it with the local, the regional approach, that can drive down and will drive down the virus if it is properly implemented.

"And that is what I believe he should be supporting.”

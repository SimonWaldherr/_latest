A creep who claimed he was armed — and just released from jail — sexually assaulted a woman in the West Village this week, cops said.

The 20-year-old victim was walking alone after she left a friend at a bus stop at West 14th Street and Eighth Avenue early Sunday, according to police.

When she reached Barrow and Greenwich streets just after 2:30 a.m., a man came up from behind and shoved her to the ground, cops said.

“I have a gun,” he allegedly threatened his victim. “Take your clothes off.”

“I just got out of jail,” he added.

He then fondled the woman underneath her clothes, according to police.

After the assault, he took off, heading east on Barrow Street, cops said.

Video shows the suspect wearing an Adidas shirt and a baseball cap, smoking a cigarette.

The woman was taken to Mount Sinai Beth Israel for an evaluation.

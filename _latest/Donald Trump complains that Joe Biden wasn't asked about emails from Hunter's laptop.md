President Donald Trump on Friday complained that his Democratic rival Joe Biden wasn't asked about his son Hunter's emails about the Ukraine during his town hall meeting.

Coming off a combative town hall of his own with NBC's Savannah Guthrie, Trump spent Friday morning in a tweet storm - sending off more than 30 missives featuring complaints about the Bidens, praise for Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and an accusation that Twitter was down on Thursday to slow the online spread of a story about Hunter Biden's laptop.

The president claimed his Biden had a 'very bad showing' at his town hall with ABC's George Stephanopoulos and slammed the network for not asking about Hunter.

'Sleepy Joe Biden had a very bad showing last night, despite the fact that @GStephanopoulos didn’t ask him any questions on his being a “corrupt politician”. Big Tech & Lamestream Media are working hard to hide this corruption!!!,' Trump wrote.

Trump echoed criticism from conservatives, who complained that Guthrie interrupted Trump with a 'question every 12 seconds' while Stephanopoulos was accused of forgetting to ask Joe Biden about his son Hunter's emails.

In his combative town hall, Trump struggled to answer questions about his COVID testing, his taxes and his debt.

The two presidential contenders had dueling town halls Thursday night in place of the second presidential debate that was canceled after Trump refused to participate virtually.

The president, however, tooted his own horn Friday morning, claiming he got 'good reviews' and, that thanks to 'strong' poll numbers, a Republican wave was coming on November 3.

'Very good reviews on last night’s @NBCNews Town Hall in Miami. Thank you!!!,' he tweeted.

And he wrote: 'Polls numbers are looking very strong. Big crowds, great enthusiasm. Massive RED WAVE coming!!!'

Biden leads Trump in most major polls both nationally and in critical battleground states. In the RealClearPolitics polling average, Biden leads Trump by 9 points.

The split-screen town halls Thursday night could not have been more different: while Stephanopoulos barely interrupted Biden, Guthrie asked more questions than the undecided voters the evening was dedicated to and challenged Trump repeatedly in a way the president doesn't usually experience, given his preference for interviews with friendlier news outlets.

'Let's waste a whole show,' he snapped at her when she asked him about the retweets on his Twitter feed, which have contained QAnon conspiracy theories and unproven claims Seal Team Six killed Osama bin Laden's body double.

'You're not somebody's crazy uncle who can just retweet whatever,' Guthrie told him as she pressed him on the issue.

She kept the president on his toes with quick questions and repeated follow ups, pushing him to answer questions he tried to deflect away - which conservative backers of Trump said was proof of media bias.

On ABC, Joe Biden was questioned by George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia, to an audience of undecided voters and set a far more sedate tone

But soon after the debate ended, Trump's campaign boasted he had 'defeated opponent' Guthrie, saying he had 'masterfully handled her attacks'.

During the evening, the president appeared to admit he owes more than $400 million to creditors, denied knowing about QAnon while praising them for fighting pedophilia, and declined to say if he was tested for COVID the day of his first presidential debate.

Unmentioned by either ABC or NBC or by Trump or Biden were Hunter Biden's emails, which were revealed by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, earlier this week and raised questions over his business dealings in Ukraine and China and whether he used his father to further them. Also unmentioned was the storm over Twitter banning distribution of stories about it on its platform.

The president accused Twitter of shutting down on Thursday to slow the distribution of the Hunter Biden story. He tweeted an article from a satire website titled: 'Twitter Shuts Down Entire Network To Slow Spread Of Negative Biden News' and added his own commentary: 'Wow, this has never been done in history. This includes his really bad interview last night. Why is Twitter doing this. Bringing more attention to Sleepy Joe & Big T.'

He later clarified that his 'Big T' reference was to Big Tech and not to Trump.

'Big T was not a reference to me, but rather to Big Tech, which should have been properly pointed out in Twitter’s Fake Trending Section!,' he tweeted.

Twitter blocked the accounts of Trump's campaign and the personal account of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany after they shared stories about Hunter Biden's Ukraine emails.

The links blocked by Twitter contained stories about emails between Hunter Biden and a Ukraine official who claimed he'd been introduced to Joe Biden. It also contained images of Hunter Biden.

The information was provided by Rudy Giuliani to the New York Post after a computer repair store owner said he'd found it on a hard drive.

The store owner said a man who he was unable to identify brought three computers into his store for repair last fall. He said he then made a copy of the emails and images on the hard drive, and provided it to the FBI and to Giuliani, Trump's lawyer.

The original stories, which also also contained business email addresses, purported to expose corrupt dealings by Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is accused by Republicans of political bias for allegedly censoring a news report alleging corruption by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden

Twitter's Jack Dorsey apologized for not providing 'context' to the company's decision to block tweets

Senate Republicans announced Thursday they plan to haul in Twitter chief Jack Dorsey for testimony about social media companies blocking users from sharing the explosive reports about Hunter Biden..

They plan to subpoena Dorsey to appear before the Judiciary Committee days before Election Day.

'We have seen big tech, we've seen Twitter and Facebook actively interfering in this election in a way that has no precedent in the history of our country,' fumed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

Dorsey apologized Thursday for the company's speedy action, which he said lacked adequate explanation.

Twitter initially said the story violated policies on 'hacked materials' and on 'personal and private information.'

'Our communication around our actions on the NYPost article was not great. And blocking URL sharing via tweet or DM with zero context as to why we're blocking: unacceptable,' Dorsey said.

He then linked to a statement from the company that said it was restricting the link because 'personal and private information' had been shared in the story.

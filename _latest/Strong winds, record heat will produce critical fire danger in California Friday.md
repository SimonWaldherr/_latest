Wind gusts could reach 30 to 55 mph from California to Colorado and red flag warnings have been issued for parts of Northern and Southern California.

In northern California, inland areas gusted to 73 mph overnight, with dry, offshore winds.

A heat advisory has been issued for almost the entire California coast, from the Mexican border to north of San Francisco, where temps will reach close to 100 degrees. Record highs are expected again Friday.

Even Burbank will be in more comfortable, in the lower to middle 80s by early next week. However, there is no rain is forecast for the state.

Meanwhile, it's starting to cool down for large portions of the U.S quickly.

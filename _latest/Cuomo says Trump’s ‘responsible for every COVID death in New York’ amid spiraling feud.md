description: > 
  “Cuomo failed to protect innocent New Yorkers from COVID-19 as he recklessly forced positive individuals into his state’s nursing homes while writing a self-promotional book,” Matthews said after Cuomo’s outburst, referring to the governor’s since-reversed policy on nursing homes."His revisionist history cannot erase his grossly incompetent decisions or the fact that President Trump took bold, aggressive actions that saved lives in New York and every state across the country.”

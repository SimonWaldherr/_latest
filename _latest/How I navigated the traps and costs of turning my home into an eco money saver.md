  How I navigated the traps and costs of turning my home into an eco money saver

  Four years ago my husband, two children and I moved into our “forever” home: a 1920s bungalow set in a two-acre plot in the Weald of Kent.We naively dreamed of an easy journey to a more self-sufficient lifestyle, of growing our own food and keeping chickens, while turning our new home eco to help reduce our carbon footprint and cut our energy bills.But making your home eco-friendly is littered with booby traps, contradictory and confusing advice and high costs.So what’s the best way to get value for money and go eco without spending a fortune?But we soon found that it was very difficult to pin down just what environmental and financial savings each potential eco feature would bring.

<div><p>Four years ago my husband, two children and I moved into our &#8220;forever&#8221; home: a 1920s bungalow set in a two-acre plot in the Weald of Kent. We naively dreamed of an easy journey to a more self-sufficient lifestyle, of growing our own food and keeping chickens, while turning our new home eco to help <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/can-apply-5000-green-homes-grant-will-boost-house-price/">reduce our carbon footprint</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/interiors/turn-draughty-period-property-eco-home/">cut our energy bills</a>.</p>
<p>But making your home eco-friendly is littered with booby traps, contradictory and confusing advice and high costs. The streamlined journey we imagined has been anything but.</p>
<p>Many more homeowners will be <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/meet-families-living-land-self-sufficient-farms/">taking on this challenge</a> following the Government&#8217;s launch last month of the Green Homes Grant scheme, which offers vouchers to carry out changes that will increase energy efficiency and cut bills. So what&#8217;s the best way to get value for money and go eco without spending a fortune?</p>
<h3>A false start</h3>
<p>We chose the house carefully, avoiding period properties and settling on a more modern home that would lend itself to an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/meet-couple-built-super-healthy-eco-house-scratch/">eco-renovation</a>. But we soon found that it was very difficult to pin down just what environmental and financial savings each potential eco feature would bring.</p>
<p>Heating our home was a priority, yet the more we researched the many options the more confused we became, with each supplier advocating their particular products.</p>

<p>The Merriam-Webster dictionary said that&#160;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/86" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;86&#8221; is a slang term in the food industry</a> that can mean either to refuse service to a customer or to &#8220;get rid of&#8221; or &#8220;throw out&#8221; an item.

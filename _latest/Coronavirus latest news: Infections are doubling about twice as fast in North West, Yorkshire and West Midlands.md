Covid-19 cases are doubling about twice as fast in the North West, Yorkshire and the West Midlands as for the whole of England, according to the largest Covid-19 study of its kind.

Across England, there are approximately 45,000 new infections each day, the report from Imperial College London and Ipsos MORI said.

One in 100 people in the North West had the virus, the highest regional prevalence, followed by the North East at 0.9 per cent.

Experts behind the React study said the rate of growth of the epidemic across England has slowed in the last month, but the country was now at a "critical point in the second wave".

It comes as separate data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that 224,400 people in England had coronavirus between September 25 and October 1, equating to about one in 240 people.

The figures represent a big jump from 116,600 people who were estimated to have Covid-19 in the previous week.

Current measures such as the rule of six and restrictions in the north of England will not be enough to bring the epidemic under control, researchers said.

The report looked at Covid-19 swabs from 174,949 volunteers tested across England between September 18 and Monday this week.

A massive fire engulfed a 33-story residential high-rise in South Korea on Thursday — forcing firefighters to evacuate hundreds of people.

Horrified residents climbed to the roof of the Samhwan Art Nouveau building in Ulsan to escape the blaze, as slabs of flaming concrete rained onto the street below, the Yonhap News Agency said .

At least 15 people were rushed to hospitals, and 43 were evacuated from the rooftop of the 334-foot tower, according to the Ulsan Fire Department.

“Suddenly, the fire came up. The windows were broken and the living room and bedroom lit up,”one witness told the outlet.

The stunning blaze likely began on the 12th floor of the building around 11 p.m. local time, fire officials said. The high rise contains 120 apartments and several commercial units.

The fire was reported extinguished several hours later.

It was not immediately clear if anyone had died inside the building, according to firefighters, who said they managed to clear most people out before the fire grew out of control. Firefighters were still searching for possible victims inside the tower Friday morning, officials said.

Dramatic footage showed quick-moving flames climbing to the top of the building as smoke billowed into the sky and flaming debris fell to the ground.

Residents of the building were also seen in footage rushing outside, some of them barefoot, with towels over their mouth in an effort to avoid inhaling hot smoke.

Fueled by strong winds, the fire quickly spread to the building’s roof and down the block, according to officials.

All 136 homes on the block were evacuated and at least 77 people were treated for smoke inhalation, fire officials said.

At one point the blaze also spread to a nearby shopping center in the Dal Dong district of Ulsan, near the southern city of Busan. Those flames were put out several hours before the tower.

One onlooker told local media outlet YTN News that “exterior material” — possibly insulation — attached to the outside of the building may have caused the fire to spread quickly.

Others said they were desperately trying to get ahold of family members who lived nearby.

The incident unfolded much like the structure fire that ripped through a 25-story residential high rise in LA in January.

In that case, the fire at the Barrington Plaza sent dozens of residents climbing out of windows and up to the roof to escape.

Eleven residents were injured and seven were hospitalized as a result of that blaze.

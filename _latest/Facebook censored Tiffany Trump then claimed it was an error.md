Facebook on Friday censored first daughter Tiffany Trump, barring people from posting her tweets after labeling them spam.

The social giant’s censorship, which the company later claimed was an “error,” followed fierce criticism from Capitol Hill of Facebook and Twitter restricting access to The Post’s reporting on emails from Hunter Biden implicating his father, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, in business deals in China and Ukraine.

Facebook blocked users from sharing the 27-year-old Georgetown Law grad’s tweets on Facebook Messenger and on their news feeds.

An error message read: “This URL goes against our Community Standards on spam: twitter.com/tiffanyatrump.”

The restriction was lifted after several hours following a request for comment from The Post.

A Facebook spokesperson told The Post, “The URL was incorrectly flagged by our automated systems as spam. We have corrected the error.”

The social network did not ban links to the Twitter accounts of Trump’s other adult children, including sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who are known for more frequently posting political content.

Tiffany Trump recently faced criticism for a maskless birthday celebration.

She occasionally speaks on behalf of her father, including in August at the Republican National Convention. On Saturday, she will host with former acting intelligence director Richard Grenell a “Trump Pride” event in Tampa, Fla., for gay supporters of the president in the swing state.

At the RNC, Tiffany slammed social media giants for anti-Trump bias.

“People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions and even the choice of who we vote for are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,” she said.

After social media censorship of The Post’s Hunter Biden reporting, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled a Tuesday hearing to subpoena Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify about blocking distribution of news stories.

Republican senators also invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear, but so far aren’t compelling him to discuss the unspecified steps taken to limit distribution of The Post’s articles on Hunter Biden.

Facebook’s Policy Communications Director Andy Stone, a former longtime Democratic operative, wrote Wednesday that Facebook was “reducing [the] distribution on our platform” of The Post’s cover story “pending fact-checker review.”

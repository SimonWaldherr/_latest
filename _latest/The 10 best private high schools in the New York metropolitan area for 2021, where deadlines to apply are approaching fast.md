As schools throughout New York City reopened their doors amidst the coronavirus pandemic, more parents seem to be turning to private schools as a safer, and more viable, option for their kids.

To prepare for the influx of students, private schools have adopted rigorous protocols to protect against COVID-19, including custom-made plexiglass desk barriers and specially tailored face masks, Bloomberg reported. Not to mention, private schools are already set up for social distancing measures with significantly lower student-to-teacher ratios than public schools.

Since COVID-19 shutdowns began, private schools throughout the city have already begun to experience a major spike in applications, according to The New York Times. The quality and standards of education at private schools are also an appealing factor for parents as students studying online continue to struggle with their online learning.

Now, Niche — an educational data analysis company — has released the latest rankings of the best private high schools in the New York metropolitan area.

At the top of the list is Trinity School, which is located on the Upper West Side and boasts a tiny six-to-one student-teacher ratio. Founded in 1709, the school has long been considered a top-tier school for kindergarten through 12th grade. It's also considered a part of the Ivy Preparatory School League.

Rankings were determined by comparing data from the US Department of Education with SAT and ACT test scores, college data including enrollment and acceptance rate, and ratings from "millions of Niche users," according to their website. A full description of their methods can be found here.

Below, Business Insider has broken down the top 10 private high schools in the New York City area, including borough, student-teacher ratio, annual tuition price and average financial aid amount.

"The Pingry School is an amazing school for all types of people," one student wrote. "You can truly be yourself and find your people there. It is a nurturing community with great teachers that are more like life advisors than strict administrators. The class schedule is manageable and sets you up for success in college. It is all about getting you ready for college in a nurturing supportive community. The athletics are ok, the facilities are great. Only downside to Pingry is no A/C, but the heating system works. Overall, I would tell others that Pingry is not for everyone, but it is for most kids."

"The Spence School is an extremely academically rigorous and challenging school," wrote a former student at the school. "It has challenged me in every sense: in the classroom and outside. The political and social conversations held in the school are strictly 'Spence conversations,' meaning you wouldn't find these conversations at any other school. The girls are respectful of one another and there is a strong sense of camaraderie within the school. I truly love everything about Spence, and if you pulled aside any Spence girl or Spence alum, they would say the exact same thing."

"I loved my experience at Dalton. It's an academically rigorous school with a collaborative environment, which are factors that one normally doesn't see paired together in a school," a junior wrote of their experience. "The teachers are amazing and seem to really care about each student's success both in and out of the classroom. Classes are mainly discussion based, thereby allowing everyone to engage in the material in a thoughtful and meaningful way. Dalton has and implements very left winged beliefs and in this way, lacks political diversity. However, they do attempt to engage in meaningful conversations about sensitive topics without imposing these beliefs."

5. The Brearley School

"I have been a student at Brearley for 11 years and am so happy to call it my home," a student wrote. "Class sizes are small which allows for interactive and engaging discussions where classmates are encouraged to share diverse views and opinions, and I find this exciting and inspiring. I appreciate that my teachers take the time to discuss essays with students as we write them – sure grades count, but the focus is not about the end result as much as it is about the process of getting there: the questions, decisions and learning along the way. There is a small and expected increase of work from year to year and academics are rigorous but I have always felt prepared with the organization and study skills that we learn, and teachers are happy to work with students on challenges they are facing as well as accommodate special circumstances."

4. Collegiate School

"My son joined Collegiate last year as a seventh grader. The school is wonderful and it accommodate my son perfectly," a parent recently wrote. The school assigned French and Music teachers for my son for the entire year since he didn't have French or bass instrument before, at the end of the year he didn't just catch up with the other kids but he also became proficient in both subjects and we couldn't ask for more. On the other hand, the school environment and the parents are welcoming. As a family of color our experience of the diversity, inclusion, and belongings was excellent and our son fit perfectly at Collegiate.

"Horace Mann is a welcoming diverse community of families and high achieving students. From the moment we inquired about sending our oldest child to HM, the school embraced us and made us feel welcome," a parent wrote. "When we toured the new upper school campus, our jaws dropped. HM feels like the grounds of an Ivy league university, not a city day school. As our children have grown, they have developed into well rounded, intellectual curious people with truly deep personal relationships with friends from many cultures. Other schools in NYC talk the talk about diversity, but you can tell from the student body and faculty that HM walks the walk."

The administration has done a good job over the past few years to work with students and faculty to implement what they believe to be important."

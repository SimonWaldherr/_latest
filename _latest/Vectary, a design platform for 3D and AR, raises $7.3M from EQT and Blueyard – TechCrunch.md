Existing investor BlueYard (Berlin) also participated.</p>
<p>Vectary makes high-quality 3D design more accessible for consumers, garnering over one million creators worldwide, and has more than a thousand digital agencies and creative studios as users.</p>
<p>With the coronavirus pandemic shifting more people online, Vectary says it has seen a 300% increase in AR views as more businesses start showcasing their products in 3D and AR.</p><p class="piano-inline-promo"></p>
<p>Vectary was founded in 2014 by Michal Koor (CEO) and Pavol Sovis (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cto" target="_blank">CTO), </a> who were both from the design and technology worlds.</p>
<p>The complexity of using and sharing content created by traditional 3D design tools has been a barrier to the adoption of 3D, which is what Vectary addresses.</p>
<p>Although <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank">Microsoft, </a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook </a> and Apple are making it easier for consumers, the creative tools remain lacking. Vectary believes that seamless 3D/AR content creation and sharing will be key to mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>Designers and creatives can use Vectary to apply 2D design on a 3D object in Figma or Sketch; create 3D customizers in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/webflow" target="_blank">Webflow </a> with Embed API; and add 3D interactivity to decks.</p>

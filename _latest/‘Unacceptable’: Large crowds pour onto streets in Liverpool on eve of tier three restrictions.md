The mayor of Liverpool has condemned the “unacceptable” scenes that took place in the city on Tuesday evening, as large crowds flooded the streets ahead of the introduction of a new lockdown.

In footage posted online, people are seen pouring into the streets around Concert Square, one of Liverpool’s most popular night-time spots, when pubs closed for the final time.

Merseyside Police said they were informed about a large gathering on Concert Square and Fleet Street at 10pm on Tuesday.

Speaking about the incident, a police spokesperson said: "Officers were deployed to the area immediately and a large crowd was dispersed quickly and safely.

"All businesses in the area have now closed and the incident has been stood down."

One video, allegedly filmed from a nearby flat, shows a crowd dozens-strong mobbing a police vehicle and trying to block the road.

A “small number of plastic glasses” were thrown at the police car but no damage was caused, according to a spokesperson for the Merseyside Police.

In response to these scenes, Joe Anderson, Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson, tweeted: "These pictures shame our city, attacking our brave police officers is unacceptable.

"Our health service is creaking, 300 in hospital and 30 people dead in week. Ignoring these facts is why we are in Tier 3 measures,” Mr Anderson added.

Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, told Sky News that the crowds were "irresponsible and really disappointing".

The comments come after new restrictions came into effect on Wednesday in Liverpool as part of the government’s three-tier coronavirus alert system, which was announced by Boris Johnson on Monday.

As Liverpool and its neighbouring five boroughs are classified as “very high risk” – tier 3 under the new system – establishments such as bars, pubs that do not serve food and gyms have now closed.

The measures also ban residents from mixing with other households, both indoors and in private gardens.

The city currently has one of the highest infection rates in the country with 634.7 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people, according to the local council.

Paul Brant, a councillor at Liverpool City Council, said that 90 per cent of intensive care beds were now occupied.

"At the current rate of increase, we would expect Liverpool to surpass the peak of the first wave probably within the next seven to 10 days,” he added.

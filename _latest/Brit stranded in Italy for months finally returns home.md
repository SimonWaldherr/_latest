 <p>     </p> <p> The former TUI admin rep told <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-stuck-italy-months-returns-19128041">Wales Online</a> of his relief at seeing his family again and described how he is still struggling with exhaustion and loss of appetite after his Covid ordeal. </p> <p>"It&#8217;s a shame but I think the lockdown is necessary," he said. "The quicker we all pull together and follow the rules, the quicker life will return to normal.</p> <p>"It&#8217;s a strange feeling being home because you do wake up in the night a few times wondering if this is real, am I actually back."</p>

 <p>Rhys said he is "building" his normal appetite back up while socialising is "weirdly exhausting and it's quite difficult talking about the past few weeks".</p> <p>"But I am over the moon to be back and think after a bit of adapting I&#8217;ll be in my normal routine again in no time," he added.</p> <p>On Friday (October 16), Rhys and friend Quinn Paczesny, 20, were told they could return home from Italy after a law change meant only one positive test was needed alongside 21 days isolation.</p>

 <p>Four days earlier, their other mate, Will Castle, 22, had already met the previous threshold of two negatives and flown back to the UK.</p> <p>The three friends had not shown any symptoms for weeks and believe an "inactive" version of the virus had kept showing up in tests.</p> <p>Rhys and Quinn arrived back to Wales over the weekend after 61 days in quarantine.</p> <p>The latter told Good Morning Britain yesterday how hugging his mum and dad for the first time since July was a "surreal moment", with emotions running high.</p>

 <p>While Rhys, who was previously stationed in Austria with TUI, told the ITV programme how his dad kept stalling the car as he drove home while making sure his daughters "got the party ready in time".</p> <p>"It was just lush, it was so nice seeing everyone. And coming from the airport at the beginning - you don't forget that moment," said Rhys.</p> <p>From the end of the week, Wales will be put into a fire-lockdown and Rhys said he is just happy to be able to spend time with his family.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>"The quicker we all pull together and follow the rules, the quicker life will return to normal.</p> <p>"Obviously I&#8217;d love to get back to work and hang out with my friends and family, but at least now I can isolate in a house with a garden, with people I can socialise with and speak to in person and not have to worry about a cleaner or doctor knocking on my door randomly."</p> <p>He is also now faced with finding a job and hopes to once again work with in the travel industry in London in the near future.</p></div>

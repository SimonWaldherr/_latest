  Body of Shannon Hoffman found at notorious Devil's Pool near Cairns 
description: > 
  The body of a missing camper who disappeared at a notorious Queensland swimming hole known as Devil's Pool has been found.Brisbane father Shannon Hoffman, 37, was swimming with a friend at the off-limits swimming site at Babinda Boulders, south of Cairns, when they disappeared below the water's surface at 6pm on Monday.Acting Inspector Brett Jenkins said the Devil's Pool is riddled with shoots and deep water currents that could 'easily take even strong swimmers underneath'.In April, Ms Tam had been swimming in a natural spa called the 'washing machine' with six others before the current pulled her downstream and into the Devil's Pool.A Sydney businessman died at the pool in 2006 and an Adelaide tourist also perished at the pool in 2004.

 <p>     </p> <p>In the first picture, he is seen wearing a cosy dark raincoat - nothing out of the ordinary here.</p> <p>But in the second picture, with the pocket flap exposed, the words "immigration enforcement" were revealed.</p> <p>Therefore, it's likely that the jacket had previously belonged to an immigration worker, who must have donated it to a charity shop.</p>

   <p>Will asked his nan where she picked the coat up from in the hopes of being able to debunk the mystery, but it didn't get him anywhere.</p> <p>He added: "Her response to me asking where she got it from wasn&#8217;t reassuring. She &#8216;can&#8217;t remember.&#8217;&#8221;</p> <p>Since being posted, Will's tweet has received more than 38,600 likes and hundreds of comments, with some people even sharing similar stories of their own.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>One said: "This just made me belly laugh."</p> <p>A second added: "Hope she won it in a fight."</p> <p>A third also wrote: "Friend of mine, 6 foot 8, struggled to find a ski suit.</p> <p>"Went to army surplus shop, bought khaki overalls with mysterious squiggles stencilled on.</p> <p>"On a slope in Austria, an Israeli skiied up to him and said: &#8216;I think we were in the same tank on the Golan Heights, no?'&#8221;</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

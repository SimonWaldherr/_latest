<div><p>The Pro phones, in addition to the third 2x lens, also pack a lidar scanner. This is the system driverless cars use to bounce light off objects, creating a 3D scan of an environment. This allows for the popular Portrait mode photos to be combined with night mode, and improves autofocus in low light situations. It also helps in augmented reality settings, but despite several years of Apple supporting the holographic technology, it is yet to crack into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Apple has packed other features into the Pro cameras, such as the ability to shoot in a RAW file format, but for the first time, it feels as if the abilities of the Pro&#8217;s camera are beyond what the average consumer might need. Having options is no bad thing, but it&#8217;s all the more reason for most people to stick with the standard iPhone 12.&#160;</p>
<p>The beauty of the iPhone camera is that it has never had complicated settings or options: you just point and shoot and the camera and software does the work. That&#8217;s as true as ever this year. If you&#8217;re upgrading from anything older than a two-year-old phone, you&#8217;ll notice a significant improvement.</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>The iPhone 12 is two different phones, depending on how you look at it.&#160;</p>
<p>The first is what it is right now: a continuation of how Apple&#8217;s handsets have changed each year since <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/11/03/iphone-x-review-phone-worth-1000/">2017&#8217;s iPhone X</a>: a welcome upgrade that makes everything work a little better without any radical overhaul.</p>
<p>The second is what it promises: 5G networks are unproven today, and it is unclear how much use we&#8217;ll get out of them, but they have enough backing that we should want to be along for the ride. MagSafe is an intriguing addition that looks set to pave the way for a wirelessly charged port-free iPhone and an array of interesting accessories. If both live up to their potential, the iPhone 12 might be seen as the biggest advance in years.</p>
<p>Neither of these additions will be front of mind to most buyers: the main reason most people will buy the iPhone 12 is the same as any other year: because their last one breaks or their contract is up for renewal. They are unlikely to be disappointed: The iPhone 12 is a very good phone: it runs fast, takes excellent photos and has a fantastic screen.</p>
<p>But judging the iPhone 12 on a different measure - significantly pushing the technological boundaries forward - will have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Standard &#8220;non Pro&#8221; models are much improved, with better screens and a mini option for those who crave a smaller display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MagSafe is an intriguing concept with a lot of potential, depending on how it is allowed to develop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements across the board on camera, design and processor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5G remains an unknown quantity, despite impressive engineering effort on Apple&#8217;s behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple&#8217;s introduction of Face ID several years ago did not allow for the rise of face coverings. One point to the fingerprint sensor.</p>

But I’ve gone with Umaga. The fact that he has kept Lima Sopoaga, an All Black, out of the Wasps team for much of this season, says everything about the 22-year-old’s meteoric rise. I’ve actually been tracking Umaga for a while. I saw a lot of him when he was training and playing a season for Yorkshire Carnegie in the Championship. A confident and elusive runner, with a good pass off both hands and a nice varied kicking game. It’s great to see him make the transition to first-team rugby - and haven’t Wasps been a revelation since the restart?

Overseas player of the season: Faf de Klerk (Sale)

A key player for South Africa at the World Cup and now a key player for Sale. De Klerk’s boundless energy, his constant sniping and big game temperament make him my overseas player of the year, although Charles Piutau at Bristol has been magnificent for Bristol, as has Jannes Kirsten for Exeter.

Try of the season: Stuart Hogg (for Exeter at Gloucester)

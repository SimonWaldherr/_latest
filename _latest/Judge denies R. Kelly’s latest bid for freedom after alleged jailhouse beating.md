Kelly&#8217;s latest bid for release amid claims the R&amp;B star <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/17/r-kelly-beaten-in-jail-no-guard-raised-a-finger-lawyers/?">was pummeled by a fellow inmate</a> while no one &#8220;raised a finger.&#8221;</p>
<p>US District Judge Harry Leinenweber also denied the &#8220;I Believe I Can Fly&#8221; singer&#8217;s request to hold a hearing over <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/08/27/r-kelly-attacked-by-fellow-inmate-in-his-jail-cell-report/?">the alleged August jailhouse beating</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this incident is concerning, it does not warrant immediate release,&#8221; Leinenweber wrote in his ruling.</p>
<p>&#8220;This single isolated incident does not suggest that the Bureau of Prisons is incapable of safely housing Mr. Kelly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly, 53, is being held at Chicago&#8217;s Metropolitan Correctional Center <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/03/13/r-kelly-accused-of-having-sex-with-minor-in-latest-federal-charges/">while awaiting trials</a> in Illinois and New York on charges including sex-trafficking and child pornography.</p>
<p>His lawyers claimed in a filing last week that footage provided by prosecutors showed that no one at the prison &#8220;raised a finger&#8221; to help Kelly until the attack against him was well underway.</p>
<p>&#8220;An unresolved issue remains as to whether MCC personnel encouraged, and then allowed, a beating of Mr. Kelly to take place. That alone merits an evidentiary hearing,&#8221; the attorneys wrote.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/08/31/r-kelly-was-nearly-stabbed-with-a-pen-during-jailhouse-beatdown-lawyer/">assault left Kelly</a> with &#8220;significant physical and psychological injuries,&#8221; the filing said. His lawyers have not released the video.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Leinenweber wrote that the inmate who allegedly beat Kelly, Jeremiah Farmer, had since been transferred to a different facility.</p>
<p>&#8220;In any event, release from custody is not the appropriate remedy for such a wrong,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mr. Kelly wishes to challenge the conditions of his confinement or the MCC&#8217;s ability to protect him, he can bring those claims in a separate civil action following proper exhaustion of administrative remedies,&#8221; Leinenweber added.</p>
<p>Leinenweber ruled that the courts still view the disgraced singer &#8212; whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly &#8212; as a flight risk and a danger to the community.</p>
<p>Since Kelly was taken into federal custody in July 2019, his legal team has <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/05/15/judge-rejects-third-r-kelly-bid-to-be-freed-amid-coronavirus/?_ga=2.69266384.1941672652.1598450780-1820962771.1571864815">repeatedly petitioned</a> the courts to release him on bail as he awaits trial but all of those requests <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/09/08/appeals-court-denies-r-kellys-freedom-bid-in-sex-trafficking-case/?">have been denied</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Kelly has not demonstrated a change in circumstances that alters the court&#8217;s previous conclusion that pretrial detention is necessary,&#8221; Leinenweber wrote.</p>

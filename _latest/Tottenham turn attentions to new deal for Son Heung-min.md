  Tottenham turn attentions to new deal for Son Heung-min 
description: > 
  Tottenham will turn their attentions to securing the futures of their current squad, with Son Heung-min in line for a new contract.But the club will now focus on trying to renegotiate the contracts of Jose Mourinho's current squad, with signing Son to an extension understood to be a priority.The Korean's importance to Tottenham on the pitch has been underlined in recent weeks, Son scoring eight goals in seven games since the start of the current campaign.Equally, however, Son retains a major significance within Tottenham's lucrative commercial strategy given his iconic status in south-east Asia.Son will enter the final two years of his contract at the end of this season.

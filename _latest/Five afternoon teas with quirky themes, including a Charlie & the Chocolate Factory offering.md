Guilds of the City Afternoon Tea, Vintry & Mercer, London

According to Vintry & Mercer, the Guilds of the City Afternoon Tea takes inspiration from the historic trades and guilds of the capital and the Great Fire of London

According to Vintry & Mercer, the Guilds of the City Afternoon Tea takes inspiration from the historic trades and guilds of the capital and the Great Fire of London.

The pastries on the menu are all designed around a theme. There's the Baker pastry, for example, that's a fruit loaf made with rum-soaked fruits, and a Vintner pastry that's a dark chocolate barrel filled with homemade mulled wine. The Fire of London pastry, meanwhile, is a kirsch-soaked chocolate sponge with milk chocolate ganache, cherries and white chocolate.

The savouries on offer are a little more classic - think roast beef and horseradish sandwiches and handmade scones.

The tea is available every Saturday between 2:30pm and 5pm and prices start at £39.50 per person.

The Potion Room afternoon tea, Cutter & Squidge, London

The ready-made menu at the Potion Room afternoon tea includes a selection of sandwiches, a 'proper pie' made with a leek and potato filling, and a Yorkshire pudding with beef and horseradish

In addition to tucking into a tiered stand full of savouries and sweet items, visitors to The Potion Room have the opportunity to get hands-on to make a few 'potions' for themselves

The experience in The Potion Room starts with visitors taking a seat at school-style tables and awaiting the arrival of a 'potions master', who will teach them how to make edible and drinkable potions to go with their tea

The Potion Room afternoon tea at Cutter & Squidge was meant to come to an end in May 2020, but it was curtailed early due to Covid-19. As a result, its creators are giving it another run in the new year.

The experience starts with visitors taking a seat at school-style desks and awaiting the arrival of a 'potions master'.

After this, the afternoon tea is served and visitors learn how to make their own drinkable and edible potions to go along with it.

The ready-made menu includes a selection of sandwiches, a 'proper pie' made with a leek and potato filling, and a Yorkshire pudding with beef and horseradish.

Prices start from £49.50 for adults and £39.50 for children.

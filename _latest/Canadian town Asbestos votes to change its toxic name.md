<div><p>For a town once named after a notoriously lethal mineral, the debate over how to rebrand the Quebec city of Asbestos was a toxic one.</p>
<p>Established more than 120 years ago, following the discovery of a profitable asbestos mine in 1897, Asbestos the municipality has suffered a declining reputation since the link was revealed between the poisonous substance and cancer, particularly the aggressive mesothelioma.</p>
<p>Asbestos as a manufacturing material was finally banned in Canada in October 2018.</p>
<p>City officials launched a campaign to change its name in November 2019, asking locals to take part in the historic measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;As citizens are the ambassadors of a municipality and are the representatives of its vitality, it was obvious that the public would be involved in the process and the choice of the new name,&#8221; said Mayor Hugues Grimard last year, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/city-of-asbestos-canada-renamed-val-des-sources/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to CNN</a>.</p>
 
<p>The first four names on the table were Apalone, Jeffrey, Ph&#233;nix and Trois-Lacs. But residents weren&#8217;t happy with their initial choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be proud to say that I live in a soft turtle city,&#8221; said one local critic on Facebook, referring to the region&#8217;s native softshell turtle, the apalone &#8212; a name suggested by Greenpeace Canada.</p>
<p>The name Jeffrey was plucked in honor of Canadian businessman W.H. Jeffrey, who helped establish the eponymous asbestos mine, but many citizens agreed it wouldn&#8217;t go far enough to distance themselves from their somewhat problematic legacy.</p>
<p>The controversy between the city&#8217;s 6,000 residents became so heated that the City of Asbestos&#8217; general manager, Georges-Andr&#233; Gagn&#233;, issued a statement last month &#8220;calling for a constructive and respectful debate.&#8221; Local lawmakers then decided to come up with a new lineup, and pushed the election another month.</p>
<p>On Oct. 2, a ballot with a batch of six names was revealed: L&#8217;Azur-des-Cantons, Jeffrey-sur-le-Lac, Larochelle, Ph&#233;nix, Trois-Lacs and Val-des-Sources. Residents cast their votes at a drive-in poll in a parking lot.</p>
<p>With 51.5%, the clear winner was Val-des-Sources, or Valley of the Springs &#8212; a nod to the town&#8217;s proximity to a wellspring that feeds three nearby lakes.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Facebook page for the city <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2925833174304421&amp;id=1409234149297672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared the results</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;After 2,796 ballots received, 3 rounds of counting and a majority of votes at 51.5%, you have chosen &#8230; Val-des-Sources!,&#8221; officials wrote.</p>
<p>Despite the majority pick, some residents maintain an ill-fated pride for the misbegotten moniker.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born in Asbestos and I want to die in Asbestos,&#8221; shouted one man, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/asbestos-quebec-renamed-history-1.5765156" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the CBC</a>, as he peeled out of the voting parking lot.</p>

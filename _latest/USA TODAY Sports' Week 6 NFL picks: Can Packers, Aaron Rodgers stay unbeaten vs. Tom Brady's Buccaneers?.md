With COVID-19 continuing to shape the NFL schedule, Week 6 looks a little different – the Chiefs and Bills playing the first part of a Monday twinbill after the league was forced to move their game, originally scheduled for Thursday night. Make sure you're done with work by 5 p.m. ET to watch two excellent 4-1 teams, though both are coming off surprise losses.

Two other Week 6 games – Broncos-Patriots and Jets-Dolphins – are now on the docket after the pandemic forced a reshuffling of the lineup, which also necessitated the Chargers taking an early bye.

A pair of other contests are worth circling. The Browns and Steelers will vie for AFC North supremacy, Cleveland trying to win in Pittsburgh for the first time since 2003. However in terms of quarterback duels, it may not get better than Aaron Rodgers vs. Tom Brady when the undefeated Packers and Buccaneers meet in Tampa late Sunday afternoon in a showdown that won't lack star power.

Microsoft will allow its employees to work from home permanently even after it reopens its offices, according to an internal memo issued this week.

Under the company's "hybrid-workplace" plan, Microsoft will let most employees work flexible hours or from home for up to 50pc of their working week without applying for approval.

If employees want to work from home permanently, they can ask for permission from their manager.

Staff can also apply for approval to relocate in the US and the company will consider remote work from another country if the location is compatible with their job role.

The tech giant has created a "geopay scale", suggesting compensation and benefits will vary depending on where an employee is based.

However, those in roles that require access to hardware labs, data centres and in-person training will still be required to go into the office.

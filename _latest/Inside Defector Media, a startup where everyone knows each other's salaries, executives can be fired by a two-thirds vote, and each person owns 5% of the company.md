Sports publication Defector Media launched in September and has accrued 30,000 paying subscribers, netting about $2 million in revenue in one month.

Motivated by their tumultuous exit from former employer Deadspin, the founding members of Defector's staff structured the new publication to be employee-owned, splitting the equity equally between 20 people.

A four-person board of managers runs day-to-day operations, but certain decisions –– like firing an editor-in-chief –– can be made with a two-thirds staff vote.

Another tenet of the publication's culture is complete salary transparency within the two-tiered system of "base salaries" and "target salaries" based on the business' success.

Business Insider reviewed company documents and financials and spoke with Defector's editor-in-chief Tom Ley and VP of operations Jasper Wang to learn the specifics of how the company runs.

Sports blog Defector Media launched in September, amidst a pandemic-fueled upheaval in professional sports, but the buzz it generated in the media industry arose in part from its unconventional business model, which was the result of one of last year's most high-profile editorial disputes.

Defector's origin story, the conflict of which is baked right into its name, stemmed from a 2019 controversy at the website Deadspin that caused 18 writers to resign, en masse, when executives at parent company G/O Media fired the publication's deputy editor and told the remaining staff to "stick to sports."

Defector is worker-owned, subscription-based, and free of outside investment. The 20 staff members all know each other's salaries, which start with a "base" and rise to a "target" depending on the company's financial success.

Smaller media outlets, like Discourse Blog and Study Hall, have embraced the worker-owned, subscription-driven model. A handful of news organizations, such as The Colorado Sun, have taken the ethos a step further, structuring their company as a legal cooperative.

Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, says that journalism has had a long history with employee-owned and cooperative models, which he points out are technically distinct. Both models help preserve "mission-centric" institutions, because they put power in the hands of those directly involved in reporting.

They also present several limitations, especially as it pertains to raising capital. If a company needs an infusion of cash to finance a pivotal investment, venture-capital-backed publications, like Vox or VICE, have the means to deploy capital as needed. Publications like Defector, however, can't raise money and still maintain full employee ownership.

"If Defector is to remain 100% employee-owned, it's not going to have access to those capital sources in the same way," said Schneider.

In addition, publications often try to keep editorial and business operations separate, in order to avoid conflicts of interest, such as the preferential coverage of an advertiser. However, Schneider said, employee ownership means reporters have as much to lose from ethics breaches as executives, meaning the business and reporting incentives are aligned.

So far Defector has accrued 30,000 paying subscribers since its September inception, generating a subscription revenue of more than $2 million, according to documents shared with Business Insider during a Zoom call. The publication also secured an inaugural advertising sponsorship with Warby Parker for an undisclosed sum.

To better understand the organizational and financial structure of Defector Media, Business Insider spoke with editor-in-chief Tom Ley and vice president of revenue and operations Jasper Wang.

A cooperative ownership structure gives staff control of the company.

When Defector launched in September, a 26-page legal record outlined that each of the first 20 employees owns 5% of the company, making it fully employee-owned.

To avoid a repeat of what they felt was mismanagement from above at their former employer Deadspin, the Defector staff resolved to keep power in the hands of the workers this time around.

According to Ley, their motivations were not exclusively pragmatic, though. Given the risk inherent in launching a self-funded media company, and the slim odds that the venture would work, the team figured they might as well shoot for the moon with Defector.

"At some point we decided that, if we were going to do this, we might as well do it as starry-eyed and idealistically as we could," said Ley.

In addition to giving employees self-determination, collective ownership also aligns the incentives of the staff and the business. When Defector does well, its employees reap the rewards.

This is a departure from how many traditional businesses are structured, in which the success of the company directly benefits a small ownership or executive group, but fails to improve the fortunes of the workers responsible for the success. At Defector, in the absence of a complex pay hierarchy, the team profits directly from their labor.

"We are the owners of the company," said Ley. "We literally own it. So, we all understand what's best for it and how to make sure everyone's getting properly compensated for what they're doing."

A board of managers is responsible for day-to-day business decisions.

Defector has no plans of an exit, so the 5% equity shares are somewhat symbolic. They grant the owners voting rights, but as for any recently launched company, they hold little to no financial value.

When Defector hires new staff, these hires will receive a percentage of equity, which means the ownership stake of the founders will become diluted. However, Ley says that new hires will initially receive a smaller percentage of equity. This partial ownership grants them voting rights, but a full staff vote is required before they can be approved for more equity.

To facilitate daily operations, Defector created a board of managers, composed of the editor-in-chief, vice president of revenue and operations, and two rotating editorial staff who are elected to the role for one year.

This management board controls many of the operational components of running Defector, including hiring, firing, making purchases, and securing advertising deals. Ley says that the entire staff meets weekly to discuss company business, but that the board has autonomy to make day-to-day business decisions.

Two-thirds of shareholders can vote to oust executives.

Larger decisions, however, require a supermajority, or two-thirds shareholders' vote. The organizational document Wang shared with Business Insider lists all the "trigger" events that require such a vote, such as the decision to take on a certain amount of debt or sell a portion of ownership to an outside party. In this sense, the staff of Defector resembles a traditional company's board of directors.

Less traditional triggering events also included in the by-laws require a two-thirds vote to fire an executive. Rules like these ensure that the staff, not the management, govern the fate of the company.

Conditions like these could easily put Ley on edge — after all, prevailing business wisdom suggests that leadership needs to be able to make tough, unpopular decisions, but one such call at Defector could lead to his ousting. Ley, however, is unperturbed.

"Is it scary to me that the staff could one day decide that I'm doing a bad job and vote to fire me? Sure. But why shouldn't it work like that?" said Ley. "If I'm supposed to be editor-in-chief of this publication, and everyone thinks that I'm doing a bad job, not giving them what they need to get their work done, not maintaining the proper vision or ethics or whatever, then yeah. They should be able to do something about that."

Everyone gets the same base salary and a 'target' salary that depends on the company's financial success.

Salaries at Defector run on a dual system of "base" and "target" salaries. In this model, all 20 staff receive the same base salary. Wang attributed this decision to the financial maxim "If we make peanuts, everyone makes the same number of peanuts," which informed their early decision-making. The team received their first paycheck based on this salary in late September.

On top of a base salary, employees have a potential "target salary," which allows them to share in the company's financial success via payouts. To reflect the different market valuations of employees' labor, Defector categorizes its employees in two groups — writers and editors — each with a different maximum target salary.

Twice a year, Defector management will assess the financial status of the company and decide what amount, if any, to pay out toward target salaries. They will then disburse that money to everyone equally, capping writers' max payout first and editors' at a higher dollar amount.

This system ensures that for the editors to enjoy a big payday, the writers will first enjoy theirs. All this, says Wang, is done in an effort to let the staff benefit when the company succeeds, while still recognizing that the positions have different market values.

Despite the complexities of the target salary cap system, the financial disparity between top and bottom earners is relatively slight. If Defector has a banner financial year, and everyone makes as much money as their contract allows, the difference between the highest-paid editor and lowest-paid writer is $30,000, according to documents shared with Business Insider.

After just one month, says Wang, Defector is on track for all staff writers to all make their peak target salaries.

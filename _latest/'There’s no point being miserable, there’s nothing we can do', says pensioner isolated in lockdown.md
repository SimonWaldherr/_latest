<div><p>When Gwen, a pensioner, moved to Tiverton&#160;in Devon, alone, a couple of years ago, it was meant&#160;to be a brand new start.</p>
<p>The 75-year-old assumed she would make new friends and settle into a new way of life, with new activities and new adventures to be discovered.</p>
<p>However,&#160;the pandemic left the retired shop assistant feeling incredibly isolated, the new groups that she had managed to join were all cancelled, neighbours retreated into their homes and her all human contact evaporated.</p>
<p>Even her daughter, who had given birth to Gwen's first grandchild in February, just before lockdown, was suddenly off limits.</p>
<p>Gwen, who does not want her full name to be published, said: &#8220;He&#8217;s the most precious thing to me now.</p>
<p>&#8220;They brought him around to see me just before lockdown so I was lucky to have a nice cuddle but obviously growing up, I&#8217;ve missed so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>For weeks during lockdown, Gwen found herself alone in her bungalow, with little to while away the long days but to read or potter about in the garden.</p>
<p>Her only contact was with a lady who came in to help with her cleaning once a week, who formed part of her bubble, which turned out to be a lifeline and something she acknowledges put her in a much better position than many.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing was not being able to pop out to the shops, even for a pint of milk.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I wanted some shopping I had to rely on Morrisons delivering or our little local farm shop because I&#8217;m at that vulnerable age,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not being a driver, that&#8217;s a drawback too.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I meet someone outside, I usually stop and smile and say hello, just to break the ice really. It&#8217;s human contact basically.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a lot of lonely and rather sad old people living on their own with nowhere to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gwen said that she found Sundays particularly tough, the hours stretching before her and knowing that she would not be seeing anyone.</p>
<p>She contacted <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/">Age UK</a> and was referred to the Telephone Friendship Service, where she was matched with a volunteer called Natalie, 32, who calls her for 30 minutes every weekend.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I look forward to that, I really do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She&#8217;s like a second daughter to me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Determined to look on the bright side, Gwen said she considered herself lucky that in spite being quite a social person, she also enjoyed her own company, pottering in the garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no point being miserable, there&#8217;s nothing we can do,&#8221; she said of the looming threat of further lockdowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just have to do what the Government tells, and hope everything settles down. There&#8217;s not a lot of options really. You do what you&#8217;re told or you pay the price.&#8221;</p>

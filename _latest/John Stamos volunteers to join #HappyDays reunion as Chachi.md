<div><p>&#8220;Happy Days&#8221; is getting political.</p>
<p>Much of the cast of the wholesome &#8217;50s sitcom set in Milwaukee is getting back together for a virtual reunion on behalf of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin &#8212; with one notable exception.</p>
<p>Former teen heartthrob Scott Baio, <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/08/06/scott-baio-still-loves-donald-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an outspoken Donald Trump supporter</a>, will likely not be throwing in his talents as Chachi for the reunion of the show that ran from 1974 to 1984.</p>
<p>Instead, actor John Stamos, 57, has offered to play the role of Fonzie&#8217;s beloved cousin, with Twitter&#8217;s approval. The sitcom star in his own right &#8212; as hunky Uncle Jesse in &#8220;Full House&#8221; &#8212; threw in his hat late Monday after the reunion announcement.</p>
<p>Baio, 60, clapped back with his own snarky response: &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t you be taking care of Aunt Becky?,&#8221; he tweeted in an apparent reference to former &#8220;Full House&#8221; co-star Lori Loughlin&#8217;s legal fallout from the <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/09/17/lori-loughlins-prison-offers-yoga-pilates-and-music-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing college admissions scandal</a>.</p>
 
<p>The reunion fundraiser kicks off Sunday, Oct. 25, at 6 p.m. CT, and will bring together Henry Winkler (Fonzie), Ron Howard (Richie Cunningham), Don Most (Ralph Malph), Anson Williams (Potsie Weber), Marion Ross (Marion Cunningham), writer Lowell Ganz and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://wisdems.org/happydays" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tickets to the pandemic-friendly</a><a href="http://wisdems.org/happydays" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> event</a> go for at least a $1 donation, with proceeds going toward &#8220;making Trump a one-term president,&#8221; according to a statement from the organizers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled a show made famous in Milwaukee is coming back home to help make Donald Trump a one-term President,&#8221; said Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. &#8220;We know all roads to the White House go through the Badger State, and with the cast of &#8216;Happy Days&#8217; helping us raise money to take back the White House, we believe even more we can deliver a victory on [Election Day].&#8221;</p>
<p>The event will feature fan questions, behind-the-scenes stories from the cast and crew, and a few surprises.</p>
<p>While many were thrilled to see Stamos step into the iconic role, others online weren&#8217;t so pleased with the replacement &#8212; or the political cause behind it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is so frustrating. First &#8216;<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/04/the-princess-bride-cast-to-reunite-for-virtual-script-reading-and-fundraiser/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Princess Bride&#8217; gets co-opted for a political purpose</a> and now &#8216;Happy Days.&#8217; I&#8217;m truly 100% fine with actors speaking their own minds, but I wish you&#8217;d leave our memories of shows we loved alone,&#8221; @freeburlington tweeted.</p>
<p>At least one user noticed the full-circle effect of booting out Baio, referencing the mysterious departure of Richie&#8217;s older brother, Chuck Cunningham, in the ninth episode of the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh good, Chachi&#8217;s been Chuck Cunninghammed,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/CollinMurr/status/1318341635655204864?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@CollinMur tweeted.</a></p>

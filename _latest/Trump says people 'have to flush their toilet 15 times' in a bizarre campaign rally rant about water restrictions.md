<p>President Trump launched into a lengthy monologue on the subject of water pressure on Sunday, insisting that Americans "have to flush their toilet 15 times" because of environmental water restrictions.</p><p>The president was speaking at a campaign rally in Nevada on Sunday as he tries to regain momentum in the polls from Joe Biden, his Democratic presidential challenger.</p><p>During the speech, Trump turned his attention to the subject of bathroom water pressure.</p><p>"I hate to say the three things. It's the shower, it's the sink, and you know the third element in the bathroom. But I don't say it, because every time I say it, they only talk about that one," he said, pointing towards a group of reporters.</p>

<p>"Because it's sort of gross to talk about, right? So I won't talk about the fact that people have to flush their toilet 15 times. I will not talk about it. I'll only talk about showers. But there is three things ... This way they can't report it."</p><p>"So what happens, I called my people, environmental people:&#160;'Why are we doing this?' Because when you wash your hands it takes five times longer ... you get soapy, you can't get it off. I said, 'Open it up.' They said 'What do you mean?' I said, 'Take the restrictors off.'"</p><p>He added: "You ever get under a shower and no water comes out? And me, I want that hair to be so beautiful."</p><h2>Watch Trump's speech on toilet flow restrictions</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly complained that US bathroom fixtures do not pump out enough water for his liking, having previously claimed in December 2019 that Americans were forced to flush their toilets "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-epa-people-flushing-toilets-10-15-times-2019-12?r=US&amp;IR=T">10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once</a>."</p>

<p>In August last year, he announced proposals to increase maximum water-flow by rolling back water and energy conservation standards.</p><p>Under <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-admin-proposes-shower-pressure-change-rules-his-hair-complaints-2020-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">the proposals</a>, the Trump Administration would loosen regulations introduced in 1992 which prevent more than 2.5 gallons of water flowing through a shower-head per minute.</p><p>"If adopted, this rule would undo the action of the previous Administration and return to Congressional intent, allowing Americans &#8212; not Washington bureaucrats &#8212; to choose what kind of showerheads they have in their homes," Department of Energy (DOE) spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/511736-energy-department-showerheads-rollback-trump-complaints">told The Hill in August</a>.</p><p>Consumer groups criticised the proposals at the time, saying that the existing rules helped to save consumers money by reducing energy and water consumption.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no need to change current showerhead standards," said David Friedman, a former DOE official under the Obama administration, <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/distorting-federal-showerhead-standards-is-wasteful-and-unnecessary/">in a statement issued in August</a>.</p><p>"Thanks to the standards, consumers have access to showerheads that not only score well on CR tests and achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, but also save consumers money by reducing energy and water consumption," he said.</p>

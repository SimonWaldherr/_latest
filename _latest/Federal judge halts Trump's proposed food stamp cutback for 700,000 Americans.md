  Federal judge halts Trump's proposed food stamp cutback for 700,000 Americans 
description: > 
  A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule that would have reduced food stamp benefits to nearly 700,000 people.In her Sunday ruling, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell wrote that implementing the change "radically and abruptly alters decades of regulatory practice, leaving States scrambling and exponentially increasing food insecurity for tens of thousands of Americans."In March, she issued a preliminary injunction against the rule that also referred to the food security threat posed by the then-burgeoning coronavirus pandemic.Since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in March, food pantries across the country have been hamstrung by the consumer run on grocery stores.According to a recent study by Columbia University researchers, more than 8 million Americans slipped into poverty since May, demonstrating the deep impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

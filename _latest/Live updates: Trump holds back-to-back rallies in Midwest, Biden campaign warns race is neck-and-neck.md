LAS VEGAS — Voters in Nevada formed long lines Saturday to cast ballots on the first day of early voting in the state. Across Las Vegas, at makeshift voting locations set up in malls, senior centers and even along the famous Las Vegas Strip, residents began assembling up two hours before the polls opened.

“I like to be first in line whatever I do,” said Ronald Otis Boyd, 49, who sat in a plastic tailgate-party chair near the front of a long line outside the West Flamingo Senior Center. “And if there was ever an election you wanted to get in line to take part in, this is the one.”

Rubbing a lizard tattoo on his right ankle, Boyd said he trusted that the vote would be fair; growing up as a military kid, he watched his father vote by mail for years.

What does trouble him is what will happen with the transition of power if Trump is not reelected, he said.

“Frankly, the man scares me,” Boyd said. “He can posture all he wants, but this vote comes down to the American people. If they vote him out, well, it is what it is. I just hope he’s an adult, accepts defeat and moves on.”

There was another reason Boyd showed up Saturday in person. He’d read about the increased scrutiny of ballot signatures and that spooked him. “My signature is like a snowflake,” he said. “I never sign it the same way, so I want somebody to watch me do it, so they know it’s legit.”

Officials assured voters that no one would be turned away from the polls; if they weren’t wearing a mask, they’d be provided one. Some precincts featured plexiglass barriers between socially distanced voting machines, which were sanitized after each use.

Anticipating long lines, local election officials offered an online tool that provided estimated wait times at each voting location.

Sandy Bailey stood in line with four extended family members. She said that people were out to get Trump. Even though Nevada was one of several states to offer all voters the opportunity to vote by mail, she was having none of it.

“I’m skeptical of this whole election,” she said. “We’ve already read about ballots being found in the trash, ballot harvesting pre-filled ballots. The potential for fraud is just too high. I want to see my vote go right into that machine, so I know it’s counted.”

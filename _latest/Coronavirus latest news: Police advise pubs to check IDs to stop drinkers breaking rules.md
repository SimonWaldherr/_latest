<p>Police have called on pubs and restaurants to check customers IDs to ensure they are following lockdown rules, it has emerged.</p>
<p>Businesses in London received letters from the Met Police to say they should ask for diners for their names, addresses and photo IDs to check they are not mixing with other households after the capital went under Tier 2 restrictions.&#160;</p>
<p>The Night Time Industries Association has said it is taking legal advice over the "unlawful" guidance, according to The Daily Mail.&#160;</p>
<p>While the British Beer &amp; Pub Association said the checks would be "fundamentally inappropriate" for pubs to carry out.</p>
<p>The letter went out last Friday after London was placed under Tier 2 restrictions, under which, people can only sit indoors with members of their household, or outdoors with up to six people from different households.&#160;</p>
<p>The Met Police said the letter was "well-intention" adding:&#160;"The local advice from one of the Met's licensing teams about this is just that - advice.</p>
<p>"It was well-intentioned and we hope that it is taken in that way. Our primary aim is to help keep all Londoners safe and ensure, through engagement and explanation, that the relevant Covid legislation is adhered to."</p>

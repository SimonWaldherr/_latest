<p>&#8220;There are many factors that could contribute to an increase in deaths indirectly due to the pandemic, with disruptions to health care being one factor,&#8221; study author Lauren Rossen, from CDC&#8217;s National Center for Health Statistics, told Reuters.</p><p>The count could miss deaths indirectly related to the pandemic, caused by disruptions in healthcare access or utilization, and from conditions such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, dementia, and respiratory diseases, the report said. But it also could reflect rises in non-COVID-19 related deaths.</p><p>The data show disproportionate increases among racial and ethnic groups that have been seen as particularly affected by COVID-19.</p>

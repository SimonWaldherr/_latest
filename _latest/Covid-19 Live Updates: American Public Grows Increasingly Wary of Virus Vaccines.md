Fauci as &#8220;a disaster&#8221; on Monday</a> and said, despite signs that the nation was headed toward another coronavirus peak, that people were &#8220;tired&#8221; of hearing about the virus from &#8220;these idiots&#8221; in the government.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The broadside, during a conference call with campaign staff just two weeks before Election Day, was hardly the closing message Trump advisers were looking for. It threatened to focus the electorate squarely on the president&#8217;s coronavirus response and pitted him against Dr. Fauci, who as the nation&#8217;s top infectious disease expert is a career government scientist the public likes and trusts far more than Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In increasingly vocal terms, Dr. Fauci has been separating himself from the White House and warning Americans to &#8220;hunker down&#8221; and brace for a difficult winter &#8212; a message at odds with Mr. Trump&#8217;s repeated, if false, assurances that the nation is &#8220;rounding the corner&#8221; on a pandemic that has claimed about 220,000 American lives.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;People are tired of Covid,&#8221; Mr. Trump complained on the call, which several reporters were invited into. &#8220;I have the biggest rallies I&#8217;ve ever had. And we have Covid. People are saying: &#8216;Whatever. Just leave us alone.&#8217; They&#8217;re tired of it.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He added, &#8220;People are tired of hearing Fauci and these idiots, all these idiots who got it wrong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Later Monday, at a campaign rally in Prescott, Ariz., Mr. Trump invoked Dr. Fauci as a way of ridiculing the coronavirus plan of his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Biden wants to lock it down. He wants to listen to Dr. Fauci,&#8221; the president said, referring to coronavirus-related restrictions on the economy. (Dr. Fauci, addressing a group of pathologists last week, said no one wants to &#8220;shut down the country again.&#8221;)</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Biden campaign, which has been emphasizing a promise to listen to science over politics, responded with relish: &#8220;Mr. President, you&#8217;re right about one thing: The American people are tired. They&#8217;re tired of your lies about this virus.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sheryl-gay-stolberg" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Sheryl Gay Stolberg</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Maggie Haberman</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/noah-weiland" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="ireland-becomes-the-first-european-country-to-reimpose-a-national-lockdown"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#ireland-becomes-the-first-european-country-to-reimpose-a-national-lockdown">Ireland becomes the first European country to reimpose a national lockdown.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A barber shop in Dublin on Monday.

He noted that, while recent restrictions appeared to have stemmed the spread of the virus, &#8220;evidence of a potential grave situation arriving in the weeks ahead is now too strong.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;While we have slowed the spread the virus, this has not been enough and further action is required,&#8221; he said in a national address on Monday night.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Under the new restrictions, nonessential shops will be closed and people will be urged to stay at home, with the exception of exercise that must take place no more than three miles from home. Restaurants will be limited to takeout or delivery.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Meeting in private homes or yards will be banned as will larger gatherings &#8212; though there is an exemption for weddings and funerals with strict limitations on numbers. Schools and child-care services will remain open despite the restrictions, a move that Mr. Martin defended as being in the best interest of children.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">He encouraged the nation to remain hopeful, even as new restrictions altered lives and livelihoods once again and the days grow shorter, adding that &#8220;even as the winter comes in, there is hope and there is light.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;If we pull together over the last six weeks,&#8221; Mr. Martin told the nation, &#8220;we will have the opportunity to celebrate Christmas in a meaningful way.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-specia" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="australia-welcomed-new-zealanders-to-visit-only-two-states-theyre-now-traveling-around-the-country"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#australia-welcomed-new-zealanders-to-visit-only-two-states-theyre-now-traveling-around-the-country">Australia welcomed New Zealanders to visit only two states.

It <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/victorian-borders-are-open-state-website-clear-to-kiwi-travellers-20201019-p566ck.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later backtracked</a>, acknowledging that anyone from New Zealand, which has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/world/australia/new-zealand-coronavirus.html" title="">for the second time eliminated the virus</a>, did not pose a risk to the state.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Michael Outram, the head of the Australian Border Force, said that the states had never raised objections to New Zealanders entering the country.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Once a passenger leaves the international terminal, once they depart the customs controlled area, the back of the baggage hall, they cease to be an international traveler or passenger, they&#8217;ve entered Australia,&#8221; Mr. Outram told reporters on Monday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The bubble, he added, &#8220;stops at the international terminal.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/livia-albeck-ripka" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#mask-mandate-in-a-montana-town-it-puts-us-at-odds-with-customers">Mask mandate?

But the sheriff in the town of Hamilton, backed up by the Ravalli County commissioners, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/masks-montana-coronavirus.html" title="">elected not to enforce the order</a>, saying individual rights took priority.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That decision left small businesses stuck in the middle of a monthslong national conflict over mask wearing as they try to keep staff safe and their doors open without alienating customers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">For the owner of River Rising Bakery, Nicki Ransier, the commissioners&#8217; decision made her life easier: &#8220;It kind of took some pressure off of us, because we&#8217;re not having that confrontation with our customers when they walk in.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Before the governor&#8217;s order, Ms. Ransier asked her staff to wear masks, but a few customers berated her employees &#8212; some of whom are in high school &#8212; over the decision. One customer told the teenagers that they were &#8220;bending the knee to tyranny&#8221; by following Mr. Bullock&#8217;s order.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Other patrons wanted Ms. Ransier to flatly require masks for all and install costly plexiglass barriers. She felt she couldn&#8217;t please anyone, so she decided her policy would focus on what she could control: employees. She would let customers choose, but ask her 14 workers to wear masks even though it can be hot and miserable.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But the commissioners&#8217; move frustrated Randy Lint, the owner of Big Creek Coffee Roasters. He thought the governor&#8217;s order would put an end to mask conflicts. Instead, he said, the commissioners&#8217; decision &#8220;puts us at odds with customers.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Dealing with fallout from stressed customers has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic,&#8221; Mr. Lint said.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amy-haimerl" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="china-has-vaccinated-60000-people-an-official-says-and-other-news-from-around-the-world"></p><p class="css-c2jxua e6idgb70">Global Roundup</p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#china-has-vaccinated-60000-people-an-official-says-and-other-news-from-around-the-world">China has vaccinated 60,000 people, an official says, and other news from around the world.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="A production facility for Sinovac Biotech, a Chinese drug company, in Beijing." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/world/20virus-briefing-CHINA/merlin_177516540_d873181f-80bf-43d3-b13c-f102278b2b20-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">A production facility for Sinovac Biotech, a Chinese drug company, in Beijing.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">China has vaccinated 60,000 people against the coronavirus and none of them have experienced any adverse reactions, a senior Chinese official said on Tuesday, acknowledging for the first time the scope of a mass vaccination campaign that has occurred even before the completion of late-stage trials.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The figures came from Tian Baoguo, a senior official at China&#8217;s Ministry of Science and Technology, who spoke at a news conference. &#8220;Initial results show that they are safe,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Chinese government&#8217;s confidence in its vaccines, four of which are in the last stage of clinical trials, could signal that it is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/business/china-coronavirus-vaccine.html" title="">ready to inoculate more people</a>.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">China is an outlier in vaccinating so many people before the conclusion of clinical trials. Officials have said the experimental use of the vaccines would not be part of trial data but would give them extra assurance that there are no safety issues. But scientists have warned that taking a vaccine that has not completed Phase 3 trials, the last stage of clinical trials before approval, carries health risks.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Before Mr. Tian&#8217;s announcement, it was not clear how many people in China had received coronavirus vaccines.

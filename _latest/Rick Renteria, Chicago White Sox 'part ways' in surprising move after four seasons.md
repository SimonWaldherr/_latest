For the second time, Rick Renteria won't manage a young Chicago core beyond its infancy.

The Chicago White Sox and Renteria "agreed to part ways" Monday in a surprising move that followed the club's first postseason berth in 12 years.

Renteria, 58, lasted four years on the south side, mostly overseeing an arduous rebuild the organization reaped this season as the White Sox went 35-25 and lost in the best-of-three wild-card series to the Oakland Athletics.

The Chicago Cubs moved on from Renteria after one season in 2014 in favor of Joe Maddon, who shepherded the Cubs to four consecutive postseason appearances and the 2016 World Series title.

With youth in the lineup — American League Rookie of the Year candidate Luis Robert, outfielder Eloy Jimenez, second baseman Nick Madrigal, shortstop Tim Anderson — and on the mound — Dylan Cease, Garrett Crochet and the likely 2021 return of Michael Kopech — a young core for future success abounds Renteria's successor, especially when complemented with Lucas Giolito, Yoan Moncada, Dallas Keuchel and AL MVP candidate Jose Abreu.

The White Sox hired Renteria on Oct. 3, 2016 to replace Robin Ventura. In Renteria's four seasons, the White Sox went 236-309.

The team said the coaching staff's employment "will be determined moving forward and in consultation with the team's next manager."

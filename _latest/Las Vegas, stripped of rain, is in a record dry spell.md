(CNN) Las Vegas continues its record dry streak as the city reports no measurable rainfall in nearly half a year.

The Vegas Strip, struck by massive layoffs due to Covid-19 , has had its challenges this year, among them the lack of rain. It has now been 165 days since any measurable precipitation has fallen, shattering a record of 150 days that had stood since 1959.

The city isn't exactly known for lush green forests or bountiful streams and rivers. The concrete jungle sits in a desert that relies on underground aquifers, the resource-strapped Colorado River and the little annual rain it receives for water.

Each day, the record books are being rewritten as the lack of rain continues. The worrying trend is replicated across several western US states as extreme drought conditions worsen each week and new wildfires rage

Over 76% of the western US is currently under drought conditions

'Nonsoon' busts prospects of rain relief

We have reached the end of the Southwestern monsoon season, which usually provides a pronounced increase in rainfall between July and September.

However, this year has been more of a "nonsoon" for Las Vegas and nearby cities.

"This monsoon season has tied the previous record (of a trace of rain) for the driest monsoon," said Jenn Varian, a National Weather Service meteorologist.

Typically, Las Vegas gets 4.19 inches of rain per year. Before this dry stretch began in April, only 2.31 inches of rain had fallen.

The scope of the expanding western drought is so prolific that the National Weather Service in Las Vegas is tracking cities with an online counter tallying each rain-free day that passes.

Hopeful for a pattern change

A strong ridge of high pressure that's firmly in place across the western US will block rain from these locations for at least the next week. There are signs that this ridge may break down and open the storm door for some much-needed precipitation by mid-October.

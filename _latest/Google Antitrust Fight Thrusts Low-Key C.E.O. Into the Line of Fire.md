description: > 
  Mr. Pichai, a former product manager, may seem an unlikely candidate to lead his company’s fight with the federal government.Google is good for the country, so goes the corporate message, and has been a humble economic engine — not a predatory job killer.In an email to employees on Tuesday, he urged Google employees to stay focused on their work so that users will continue to use its products not because they have to but because they want to.“Scrutiny is nothing new for Google, and we look forward to presenting our case,” Mr. Pichai wrote.“I’ve had Googlers ask me how they can help, and my answer is simple: Keep doing what you’re doing.”

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Pichai, a former product manager, may seem an unlikely candidate to lead his company&#8217;s fight with the federal government. But if the tech industry&#8217;s bumptious history with antitrust enforcement is any lesson, a caretaker who has reluctantly stepped into the spotlight might be preferable to a charismatic leader born to it.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Mr. Pichai, 48, is expected to make the case &#8212; as he has for some time &#8212; that the company is not a monopoly even though it has a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">92 percent global market share </a>of internet searches. Google is good for the country, so goes the corporate message, and has been a humble economic engine &#8212; not a predatory job killer.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;He has to come off as an individual who is trying to do the right thing not only for his company but broader society,&#8221; said Paul Vaaler, a business and law professor at the University of Minnesota. &#8220;If he comes off as evasive, petulant and a smart aleck, this is going to be a killer in front of the court and the court of public opinion.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Google declined to make Mr. Pichai available for an interview.

<div><p>Petr Cech is a shock inclusion in Chelsea&#8217;s 25-man Premier League squad as emergency cover in case of a coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The 38 year-old, who returned to the Blues as technical and performance advisor last summer, will essentially be Chelsea&#8217;s fifth-choice goalkeeper this season.</p>
<p>A statement from Chelsea said: &#8220;Petr Cech has been included in the squad as emergency goalkeeper cover. This is a precautionary step due to the unprecedented conditions currently caused by the Covid-19 crisis. He takes up a position as a non-contract player.&#8221;</p>
<p>t means Cech will continue to train on a regular basis with the first team this season, having amazed the Chelsea players and staff with his performances at the club&#8217;s Cobham base.</p>
<p>Cech started training with the goalkeepers in a bid to help Kepa Arrizabalaga and offer guidance to new &#163;22 million signing Edouard Mendy, who joined from Rennes.</p>
<p>But it was immediately clear that Cech could still be playing at the highest level had he not retired on leaving Arsenal at the end of the 2018/19 season.</p>
<p>Cech&#8217;s fitness and agility was such that Lampard publicly claimed he had retired too early and convinced players and staff that he could still be playing.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that Cech will play for Chelsea again, given there are essentially three first-team goalkeepers ahead of him, but the club had a space in their 25-man squad and decided the former Czech Republic international should take it.</p>
<p>Mendy has emerged as head coach Frank Lampard&#8217;s first-choice goalkeeper, ahead of error-prone Kepa and 39-year-old Willy Caballero. Chelsea also have 19-year-old Academy goalkeeper Karlo Ziger.</p>

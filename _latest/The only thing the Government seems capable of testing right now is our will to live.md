Mr Hancock reached for his PPE degree (politics, philosophy and epidemiology) to justify the loss of liberties. “The thing about this virus is that you can pass it on without even knowing it”, he added. (Bit like other viruses, then). Severe measures are needed, he said, “to keep people safe, and to protect the NHS”.

Ah, the NHS. The Health Secretary never appears in the Commons without his beloved NHS badge, presumably to remind the nation why they are laying down their freedoms. He doubtless pins it on his pyjamas before bed.

"Things will get worse before they get better, but I know there are calmer seas and brighter skies ahead", Mr Hancock concluded, with an assumed jauntiness that left no one in doubt of the approaching gales.

Alas, anyone hoping for relief from the prevailing sense of paralysis would have been disappointed by what followed. Shadow Health Minister Jonathan Ashworth called for a 2-3 week ‘circuit breaker’ and piteously demanded more financial support for restricted areas.

When could Britain expect weekly, nationwide testing to resume normality, asked Jeremy Hunt - a sensible request, if a tad ambitious. The only thing the Government seems capable of testing right now is our will to live.

It fell to Munira Wilson of the Lib Dems to pose the billion-pound question. Where was the evidence? What modelling had been done on the impact of the restrictions on London, she asked, and how long could we expect them to last?

“We are seeking to publish further evidence”, replied the Health Secretary. How big of him.

Forget the virus, at this miserable juncture, the real question is can Matt Hancock be suppressed? I’d feel safer with Snowy the dog in charge than Tyrannical Tintin.

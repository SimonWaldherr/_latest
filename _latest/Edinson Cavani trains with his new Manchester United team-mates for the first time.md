  Edinson Cavani trains with his new Manchester United team-mates for the first time 
description: > 
  Edinson Cavani has finally taken part in his first Manchester United training session after joining the club this summer as a free agent.But with the two week spell having now elapsed, Cavani was free to be put through his paces alongside his team-mates at the club's Carrington complex on Sunday.And his series of interviews after signing for the Old Trafford giants have underlined his desire to help the club win silverware again.Cavani, who scored 200 goals in 301 games for PSG, even sensationally insisted that his target is to win the Premier League.'That's what I would like to achieve with this club, win trophies, win titles, and then to be able to make the same impression here that I've always tried to make with every club I've played at.'

Six-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady is facing some serious backlash after Thursday night’s loss to the Bears.

The 43-year-old is getting dragged for an uncharacteristic mental gaffe on the Buccaneers’ final drive of the game where he appeared to lose track of downs. Brady signaled the number four after an unsuccessful fourth-and-six play, which was an incompletion intended for Cameron Brate, suggesting he thought the previous play was on third down.

Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said Brady “knew” it was fourth down and Brady didn’t tackle the topic directly.

“Why can’t Tom Brady just own up to screwing up?? Don’t try to make up some BS excuse,” former Giants quarterback Danny Kanell wrote on Twitter.

“I can’t believe 6X Super Bowl Champion Tom Brady lost track of downs in their 20-19 loss to the Bears,” NBA great Magic Johnson wrote on Twitter after the game.

“Wow! Tom Brady didn’t realize it was 4th down… you forget things in your old age. #TNF” retired linebacker-turned-Fox Sports analyst Emmanuel Acho wrote, accompanied by an eight-second video clip.

The drive ended in a turnover on downs and the Bears won 20-19, snapping the Buccaneers’ three-game winning streak.

Brady’s actions after the game earned him even more criticism as he did not shake opposing quarterback Nick Foles’ hand and exchange pleasantries as is customary.

The NFL has technically outlawed such exchanges in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, though most — including Brady himself after the Buccaneers’ 38-31 win over the Chargers last week — have not adhered to the protocol, as pointed out on social media.

“No, didn’t get a chance to say anything to him,” Foles said of the cold shoulder after the game. “Sure sometime we’ll catch up but, you know, we’re trying to keep our distance.”

Others were less forgiving for the unsportsmanlike display and lambasted Brady, as this is the second time he did not shake Foles’ hand following a loss. He faced scrutiny after Super Bowl 52 when he also ran off the field at U.S. Bank stadium without shaking his opponent’s hand.

“And then not shaking Foles hand after the game?? Rough night for the GOAT,” Kanell said.

The 3-2 Buccaneers’ next matchup will take place against the 4-0 Packers at home on Oct. 18 at 4:25 p.m. ET.

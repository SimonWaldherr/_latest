Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer doubled down on her claims that President Trump is fueling threats against her — as she referred the group who plotted to kidnap her as a “domestic terror organization.”

Whitmer appeared on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Friday, a day after authorities announced the arrest of militia members who plotted to kidnap her in hopes of starting a second civil war. She said the threats against her and others haven’t stopped.

“There is ongoing rhetoric,” she said. “Even the president last night in his tweet storm won’t stop attacking me, and I think that it’s creating a very dangerous situation — not just for me but for people in leadership roles who are trying to save lives all across this country.”

Whitmer also spoke out about the “very serious thought-out plot” allegedly hatched by 13 men who sought to abduct her, put her on “trial” ahead of the Nov. 3 election and storm the state Capitol over the coronavirus restrictions she imposed in the state.

The men — some of whom affiliated with the militia group Wolverine Watchmen — allegedly discussed killing Whitmer and also targeting law enforcement officers.

“These are the types of things you hear from groups like ISIS,” Whitmer said on ABC. “This is not a militia — it is a domestic terror organization. We need to call it out and people of goodwill on both sides of the aisle need to stand up and do the right thing here, because this should not stand in the United States of America in 2020.”

Trump on Thursday night blasted Whitmer on Twitter — after she first accused the president of influencing the scheme and refusing to “condemn white supremacists and hate groups.”

“My Justice Department and Federal Law Enforcement announced today that they foiled a dangerous plot against the Governor of Michigan,” Trump wrote in a series of tweets.

“Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist—while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence.”

“Each time he has tweeted about me, each time that he has said ‘liberate Michigan’ and said I should negotiate with the very people who are arrested because they’re ‘good people,’ that incites more domestic terror,” Whitmer said on Friday. “And I am not the only governor going through this. Certainly it’s been worse for me than most, but it is not unique to me, it is not even unique to Democrats. This White House has a duty to call it out and they won’t do it — in fact, they encourage it.”

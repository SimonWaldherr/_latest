<div><p><a href="https://www.venn.tv">VENN</a> , the streaming network hoping to be gaming culture&#8217;s answer to MTV, has raised $26 million to bring its mix of video game-themed entertainment and streaming celebrity features to the masses.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The financing came from previous investor Bitkraft, one of the largest funds focused on the intersection of gaming and synthetic reality, and new investor Nexstar Media Group, a publicly traded operator of regional television broadcast stations and cable networks around the U.S.</p>
<p>The investment from Nexstar gives Venn a toehold in local broadcast that could see the network&#8217;s shows appear on regular broadcast televisions in most major American cities, and adds to a roster of Nexstar properties including CourtTV, Bounce, and Ion Television. The company has over 197 television stations and a network of websites that average over 100 million monthly active users and 1 billion page views, according to a statement from Ben Kusin, Venn&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;VENN is a new kind of TV network built for the streaming and digital generation, and it&#8217;s developing leading-edge content for the millennial and Gen Z cultures who are obsessed with gaming,&#8221; Nexstar Media Group President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Thomas E. Carter said in a statement. &#8220;Gaming and esports are two fast growing sectors and through our investment we plan to distribute VENN content across our broadcast platform to address a younger audience; utilize VENN to gain early access to gaming-adjacent content; and present local and national brands with broadcast and digital marketing and advertising opportunities to reach younger audiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how much traction with younger audiences Venn has. The company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjhfuditlW14fHaV2yrVH-g">YouTube</a> channel has 14,000 subscribers and its <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/watchvenn">Twitch Channel</a> boasts a slightly more impressive 57.7 thousand subscribers. Still, it&#8217;s early days for the streaming network, which only began airing its first programming in September.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/meet-venn-the-company-hoping-to-build-mtv-for-the-gaming-generation/">its launch a little over a year ago</a>, Venn has managed to poach some former senior leadership from Viacom&#8217;s MTV and MTV Music Entertainment Group, which has been the model the gaming-focused streaming network has set for itself. Jeff Jacobs, the former senior vice president for production planning, strategies and operations at MTV&#8217;s parent company, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/viacom" target="_blank">Viacom </a> and most recently an independent producer for Viacom, the NBA, Global Citizen and ACE Universe. </p>
<p>Venn is currently available on its own website and various streaming services as well as through partnerships with the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roku" target="_blank">Roku </a> Channel, Plex, Xumo, Samsung TV Plus and Vizio.</p>
<p>The company has also managed to pick up some early brand partnerships with companies including Subway, Draft Kings, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alienware" target="_blank">Alienware, </a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/adidas" target="_blank">Adidas </a> and American Eagle.</p>

Some buyers might prefer earbuds that emphasize accurate audio performance, while others may opt for a pair that prioritizes portability.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-over-ear-headphones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over-ear headphones</a> are bigger than other styles and feature earcups that cover your ears to create a seal. This type of headphone is a good fit for people who want the best sound quality and noise isolation. On-ear headphones are similar, but their earcups simply rest on your ear rather than create a seal over them. This allows on-ear models to be a bit more compact, but they're less ideal for blocking outside noise. Gaming headsets can be either over-ear or on-ear, but they usually include a built-in boom microphone for voice chat.</p><p>Meanwhile, if portability is your main interest, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-earbuds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earbuds</a> are the best option since they use separate buds designed to rest just outside or within your ear canal. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True wireless models</a> are even more convenient since they're completely free from cables.&#160;</p><p>For more headphone recommendations and deals all year long, check out our roundup of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/headphone-deals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best headphone deals</a>, and our various headphone buying guides:</p>

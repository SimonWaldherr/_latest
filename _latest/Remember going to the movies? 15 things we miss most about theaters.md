And it&#8217;s a good one. But it doesn&#8217;t compare to actually going to the movie theater.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Of course, the screen is bigger and better at a theater than it is at home, but USA TODAY's movie team&#160;longs for the little things associated with a trip&#160;to the cinema.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Here&#8217;s what we miss most about going to the movie theater:</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Watching movies at home doesn't quite capture the thrill of going to the movies. Let us explain,"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">There's an art to date night</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Listen, it&#8217;s nice to be able to pause and run to the bathroom, refill snacks or make your own Negroni. But watching movies at home ruins&#160;the magic of a shared experience, especially when your plus one checks their phone or keeps glancing&#160;at incoming texts on their Apple Watch. PAY ATTENTION! I want to holler, but I cannot, because it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/06/26/coronavirus-and-romance-7-summer-date-ideas-couples-quarantine/3247466001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">COVID date night</a> and it was him who made the Negronis, anyway. &#8211; Andrea Mandell</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-movies-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">The magical soda machine</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fountain soda&#160;just tastes better. With some of the newer drink machines, you can make infinite mixes out of flavors you didn&#8217;t even know existed (Peach Fanta?! Orange Diet Coke?!). Each film got a special drink. &#8211; Carly Mallenbaum</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Absurdly large containers of popcorn</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">I miss having a disagreement&#160;at concessions over the popcorn, and the fact that&#160;&#8211; I believe &#8211; an extra-large bucket of the stuff will always be a ridiculous amount of food and free refills make the purchase even more absurd. But arguing that point with my hungry loved ones,&#160;amid the alluring smells of freshly popped goodness in concessions, has become a comforting ritual.&#160;&#8211;&#160;C.M.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Remember concessions? Remember those theaters that offered alcoholic beverages? Good times."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Debating the coming attractions</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">There&#8217;s something about watching coming attractions that makes me feel as though I&#8217;m an ancient Roman determining whether what I&#8217;ve just seen deserves a thumbs-up. My one-word reviews, uttered quietly, are inconsequential but somehow feel all-powerful in the moment. &#8211;&#160;C.M.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">The drama of opening credits</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The lights go down. The people beside you shush. The person three seats down turns off his phone. A latecomer scurries to her seat whispering, &#8220;Sorry!&#8221;&#160;It&#8217;s happening. There&#8217;s an immediacy to the start of a film inside a darkened theater that pressing play&#160;at home just can&#8217;t match. &#8211;&#160;A.M.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-movies-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">The anonymous sniffles</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Is there anything more intimate in a public space than hearing strangers suck in their weepy snot? It fosters a sense of community. &#8211;&#160;C.M.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Hearing everything in&#160;surround sound&#160;</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">I couldn&#8217;t hightail it to a theater fast enough to experience &#8220;Wonder Woman&#8221; in Dolby Digital, with bullets whizzing by unnervingly as Gal Gadot <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/05/31/why-women-are-crying-when-they-watch-wonder-woman-fight/102328772/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">fought her way solo through no man&#8217;s land</a>. And I&#8217;d rank the joy of being engulfed in The Beatles&#8217; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_MjCqQoLLA" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">&#8220;Na-na na nas&#8221;</a> while &#8220;Hey Jude&#8221; plays at the end of &#8220;Yesterday&#8221; right up there with&#160;any Marvel post-credits scene.&#160;&#8211;&#160;Kim Willis</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">The collective spontaneous reaction</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Sure, we could all do without the loud dude who announces what&#8217;s going to happen before every pivotal scene. But there&#8217;s no substitute for the energy of the group gasp that occurs at any movie&#8217;s equivalent of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwtaM0GC-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">&#8220;The Empire Strikes Back&#8221; shocker</a> (&#8220;I am your father&#8221;) or &#8220;The Crying Game&#8221; twist (Google it).&#160;&#8211;&#160;K.W.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Dressing to match&#160;the occasion</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Movies are the ultimate, accessible event night that require just enough effort to make it special:&#160;getting dressed, navigating arrival and giving undivided attention in the dark. When the entertainment on the screen meets what you give, that&#8217;s how movie magic happens. &#8211; Bryan Alexander</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Experiencing old movies on a big screen</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Is &#8220;Tenet&#8221; an actual movie or Film Twitter&#8217;s cruelest joke? Honestly, who even cares? We just want to see a movie &#8211; ANY&#160;movie &#8211; in theaters right now. Nothing beats seeing a classic film on the biggest screen possible, thanks to local independent theaters and programmers such as Fathom Events. We&#8217;ll never forget craning our necks&#160;to watch &#8220;Lawrence of Arabia&#8221; from the first row of a theater, or feeling the stares of kids and their parents as we bawled through a brunch screening of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xZif3WmG7I" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">&#8220;E.T.&#8221;</a>&#160; &#8211; Patrick Ryan</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="We've done a lot of research to answer the question &quot;What is the best seat in the house?&quot;"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Snagging&#160;the perfect seat</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">First row up from the floor in stadium seating. Dead center. Legs up on a guard rail (as long as no one else is in front of you). Nothing&#8217;s better. &#8211; Brian Truitt</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">The thrill &#8211; and risk&#160;&#8211; of IMAX seating</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Huge IMAX theaters are another beast entirely and there&#8217;s a thrill of the hunt to snag the very few best seats in the house: right smack in the middle of the place. Everything else is a crapshoot, and good luck with your future chiropractic appointment if you end up in the front row. &#8211;&#160;B.T.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-movies-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Sticking it out to the bitter end</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Marvel superhero movies have taught (most of) us that just because the credits roll, the movie isn&#8217;t always over yet. While we wait around for a tease of a next film, we&#8217;re gifted with the names of all cast and crew &#8211; the grips, the craft service, the music engineer &#8211; so we can fully understand the enormous amount of work that goes into our entertainment. Viewing at home, and scrolling on the navigation bar to the end to see if there&#8217;s anything worth watching, just isn&#8217;t the same. &#8211;&#160;B.T.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Whispering about post-movie plans</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Asking my friends what we&#8217;re doing afterward as we walk down the carpeted stairs when the credits roll.&#160;Plans! God, I miss plans. &#8211;&#160;A.M.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Eavesdropping on exit&#160;chit-chat</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Of course, we must go somewhere to dissect the film after sitting through it. But first, I need to listen to&#160;my fellow moviegoers' conversations to get a read on&#160;reaction to what we just saw. This reminds me: I really miss eavesdropping.&#160;&#8211; C.M.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Drive-in theaters:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2020/06/11/coronavirus-drive-movie-theaters-list-summer-2020/5328487002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">A guide to the options available near you</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Mandatory masks and empty seats:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/06/30/movie-theaters-reopening-expect-mandatory-masks-empty-seats/3259421001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Here's what to expect when movie theaters reope</a>n</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/entertainment/movies/2020/03/24/movies-postponed-by-coronavirus-crisis-mulan-matrix-batman-wonder-woman/111460070/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

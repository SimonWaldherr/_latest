<div><p>Women aged 50-60 are at greatest risk of developing &#8220;long Covid&#8221;, analysis suggests. Older age and experiencing five or more symptoms within the first week of illness were also associated with a heightened risk of lasting health problems.</p>
<p>The study, led by Dr Claire Steves and Prof Tim Spector at King&#8217;s College London, analysed data from 4,182 COVID Symptom Study app users who had been consistently logging their health and had tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>In general, women were twice as likely to suffer from Covid symptoms that lasted longer than a month, compared with men &#8211; but only until around the age of 60, when their risk level became more similar.</p>

<p>Increasing age was also associated with a heightened risk of long Covid, with about 22% of people aged over 70 suffering for four weeks or more, compared with 10% of people aged between 18 and 49.</p>
<p>For women in the 50-60 age bracket, these two risk factors appeared to combine: They were eight times more likely to experience lasting symptoms of Covid-19 compared with 18- to 30-year-olds. However, the greatest difference between men and women was seen among those aged between 40 and 50, where women&#8217;s risk of developing long Covid was double that of men&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a similar pattern to what you see in autoimmune diseases,&#8221; said Spector. &#8220;Things like rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease and lupus are two to three times more common in women until just before menopause, and then it becomes more similar.&#8221; His guess is that gender differences in the way the immune system responds to coronavirus may account for this difference.</p>



<p>The study, which was published as a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1.full.pdf" class="u-underline">preprint </a>and has not yet been peer reviewed, also found that experiencing five or more symptoms during the first week of developing Covid-19 was associated with a heightened risk of lasting health problems.</p>
<p>Here too, differences in the immune response may be involved: &#8220;There&#8217;s certainly a group of long Covid sufferers that have this multi-system immune&#8211;like disease, where they get gastrointestinal problems, skin rashes, nerve problems and brain fog &#8211; so the whole body is involved rather than just one bit,&#8221; said Spector. Probably, the immune system is working differently in such people, which may manifest as symptoms in multiple body systems being experienced from week one.</p>

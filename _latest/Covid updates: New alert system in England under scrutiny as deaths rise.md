London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said it is "inevitable" the capital will pass a "trigger point" to enter a higher tier of coronavirus restrictions in the "next few days".

He said: "Across our city... the average over the last seven days is about 90 [cases] per 100,000.

"All the indicators I have, hospital admissions, ICU [intensive care unit] occupancy, the numbers of older people with cases, the prevalence of the disease, the positivity, are all going in the wrong direction.

"Which means, I'm afraid, it's inevitable over the course of the next few days, London will have passed a trigger point to be in the second tier."

The mayor insisted London should move as a whole into greater restrictions, despite variable rates across the capital.

He said: "We're keen to go as one, as we can see the complexities and the confusion caused by some boroughs having additional restrictions and other boroughs having less.

"Many Londoners work in one borough, live in another borough, study in another borough, go to a restaurant in another borough so we're really keen to go as one city."

The new three-tier system of restrictions in England was announced on Monday. Currently, London is in tier one, meaning only coronavirus restrictions that are in place nationally, such as the rule of six indoors and the 22:00 pub curfew, apply.

The extra tier two restrictions would involve no mixing between different households in any indoor settings, and the rule of six would also apply outdoors.

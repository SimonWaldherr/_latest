<div><p>Despite the breakthrough, tough negotiations are expected on the major obstacles of fishing, the "level playing field" guarantees, especially on subsidy law, and the enforcement of the deal&#160;in the weeks ahead.&#160;</p>
<p>"It is clear that significant gaps remain between our positions in the most difficult areas, but we are ready, with the EU, to see if it is possible to bridge them in intensive talks," a Number 10 spokesman said.&#160;</p>
<p>"As both sides have made clear, it takes two to &#160;reach an agreement. It is entirely possible that negotiations will not succeed. If&#160;so, the UK will end the transition period on Australia (WTO) terms and will prosper in doing so."</p>
<p>Mr Barnier said: "We will seek the necessary compromises on both sides. In order to do our utmost to reach an agreement, we will do so right up until the last day that it's possible to do so. Our doors will always remain open right up until the very end."</p>
<p>He said the "level playing field" guarantees remained "a fundamental concern" but also praised British negotiators for exploring ways to soothe EU anxieties over fair competition.&#160;</p>
<p>"The past few weeks, we've seen the UK are willing to look at this demand and to move forward and shift. They're willing to do things in a different way to what exists in current trade deals among other countries," he said.&#160;</p>
<p>But he warned that there would not be a trade deal unless a compromise was reached on <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/12/france-vows-show-no-weakness-brexit-fishing-fight/">fishing rights</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>"There will not be a trade deal without a fair solution for fishermen on both sides, and we will insist on this right up until the very end," he said. "There needs to be mutual access to waters, and there needs to be a fair distribution of quotas for fishermen on both sides."</p>
<p>Charles Michel, the European Council president, said: "Brexit was not our decision. And it was not our fishermen's decision. Stopping access to UK waters would cause extraordinary damage to our fishing fleets. Yes, we want to keep access to UK waters for fishermen, exactly like the UK wants to have access to our huge and diversified markets for companies.</p>
<p>"The UK has a big decision to make. We want to deal&#160;which is fair and balanced, but we're also ready in case of no deal."</p>

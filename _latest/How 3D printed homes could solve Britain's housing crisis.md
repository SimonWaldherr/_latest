<div><p>Figures released last week from Rightmove found that the average home price was &#163;323,530, up 5.5pc on last year, and the fastest rate of growth in more than four years. As demand has ticked ever-higher, first-time buyer numbers have been tumbling.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stars are finally aligning to make it clear that we cannot continue and rely upon contracted building suppliers in the way we always have done," says Richard Valentine-Selsey, a Savills analyst. "Any way that we can create new housing is beneficial, because we will not get to the Government's 300,000 homes per year target if we don't have more people active in this space.</p>
<p>&#8220;3D printing should be and probably will be one of the many tools to deliver housing. It may start out as a niche high-end project, but as it matures, then you could start seeing it trickling down."</p>
<p>There are some who would argue that the change in working habits, which has seen huge numbers of people shift to remote working, could provide an unexpected boon for those hunting for houses, though. It could, some say, free up commercial properties to be converted into residential properties, and so offer a solution to the housing crisis in itself.&#160;</p>
<p>But, not everyone is convinced. Griffin says conglomerates may be looking to exit their leases in skyscapers, but these properties are quickly being scouted by tech giants who have benefitted from the pandemic. &#8220;These tech companies are very cash rich and they see this as an investment opportunity to buy real estate in pretty favourable locations for next to nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this opens the field up to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/house-prices/3d-printing-homes-answer-uks-housing-crisis/">3D-printing companies to make their play in Britain</a>. Up until this point, experts say there have been hurdles to overcome here in the UK. Even now, government&#160;champion Farmer says "it would be unacceptable in Britain to just leave a concrete structure. The building would&#160;cladding, and fitting out".</p>
<p>For him, there is still "some way to go". Yet, 3D printing&#160;may be a trend that is quickly coming down the line.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think about it, it&#8217;s the same question as why General Motors and Ford and Volkswagen didn't produce electric cars sooner when they could have,&#8221; futurist Griffin says. &#8220;What you need is an external disruptor to come in. That then shakes up the industry, and then the industry incumbents start moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>With demand for properties at record highs and external disruptors chomping at the bit, these companies may have to start moving sooner than they think.</p>

I had always been a career girl. Through my 20s and early 30s, I was focused on my work in broadcasting and had given precious little thought to marriage or babies. It was something I assumed would just happen.

By the time I neared my mid-30s, most of my friends were married and had already started having children. It was around this point I met Justin, at the opening of my friend’s wedding shop. From the moment I saw him, I just knew he would become my husband. It was quite an extraordinary feeling.

Sure enough, five weeks later we were in the Maldives and engaged. We married shortly afterwards and I couldn’t have been happier.

I was, and still am, head over heels in love with Justin and had a sudden, desperate, biological urge to make him a father. On our first anniversary, we returned to our wedding venue of Babington House in Somerset. I was overjoyed to learn I was pregnant. I couldn’t believe how lucky I was to have met the man of my dreams and to be carrying his baby.

I was totally unprepared for my first miscarriage. I had assumed everything would unfold as it should. So when we attended our first 12-week scan and the sonographer excused himself, offering us “a moment alone”, I had no idea what he meant. Once I had understood that what he was saying was ours was not a viable pregnancy, I felt stunned and utterly devastated.

Each pregnancy I had after that was shorter than the last. I didn’t know then that a worsening medical condition was causing my multiple miscarriages. Neither the name of the condition nor the number of miscarriages I had are what matters here: the reason I have finally decided to speak out is that the trauma of losing a baby, or babies, remains too great a taboo.

This is why I have decided to tell my own story here and in a documentary. I promised myself at the time that if I was ever successful at having my own children, I would use my voice to help others.

No one can be prepared for the experience of a failing pregnancy. The emotional heartbreak and the horror of what happens is frightening.

In my case, the horror was deepened by media attention. At that time, I was anchoring the BBC Six O’Clock News and was the holder of the first Strictly Come Dancing glitter ball trophy. I did not announce any of my pregnancies which had not gone beyond the 12-week mark. So I was left reeling when a journalist was patched through to me on the news desk, just moments before going on-air, to “offer me her deepest condolences for the baby I had just lost”.

I had no idea how she knew. Confused and dismayed, I accused the clinic of breaching our privacy; I accused friends of failing to support us; I even cut ties with some of those who I believed had betrayed me. Only eight years later did I learn from the police that my phone was being hacked by The Daily Mirror.

But as violated as I had felt, this was not the worst of it. My real shame was the feeling that I had failed Justin as a wife. I felt barren, responsible for taking away his chance of becoming a father.

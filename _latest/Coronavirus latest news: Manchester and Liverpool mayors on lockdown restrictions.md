  Coronavirus latest news: Manchester and Liverpool mayors on lockdown restrictions

Professor Matt Keeling, one of the scientists behind a non-peer-reviewed paper claiming a circuit-breaker lockdown could save lives, said the "stricter the restrictions, the greater the impact".

A circuit-breaker would "buy us more time" in the struggle to reduce the rising number of infections," he said.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "What we've got at the moment is a situation where most areas of the country are facing an exponential rise in cases, and what a circuit-breaker or precautionary break would do is drive down R for that short two-week period.

"It would effectively bide us more time to put other controls in place.

"One of the ways of thinking about this is it kind of takes us back in time to when cases where lower, and therefore gives us opportunities to do other things, it reduces the number of cases as well as leading to a similar decline in hospitalisations and also deaths over a short period."

Asked about the numbers of lives that could be saved as a result of a circuit-breaker, he said: "We looked at a range of different scenarios, from a relatively low growth rate going forward where we might sort of reduce deaths by a third between now and new year, to some extreme scenarios, which I think are the ones that have been quoted in the papers, which really were if we don't do anything between now and the new year."

Put to him that a circuit-breaker "simply postpones" deaths, Prof Keeling said he "completely" agreed with that but added: "We stress that this is only a short-term measure - it buys us time to put other measures in place, but at the moment we do need that time."

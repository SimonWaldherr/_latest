<div><p>Suspected gas explosion in shop underneath flats led to collapse of building in Ealing</p><p>People are believed to have died after a suspected gas explosion in a shop underneath flats in west <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london" class="u-underline">London</a> led to the collapse of the building.</p>
<p>London Fire Brigade (LFB) said it believed there were fatalities within the property on King Street in Ealing, but was unable to confirm how many.</p>
<p>Emergency workers are involved in a &#8220;complex&#8221; and &#8220;painstaking&#8221; operation as they continue to search for anyone who may still be inside after the incident on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Station commander Paul Morgan, from LFB, said: &#8220;Sadly we believe that there are fatalities within the property although we&#8217;re unable to confirm numbers at this stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The explosion caused substantial damage to the shop and structural damage throughout. It is a painstaking and protracted incident with firefighters working systematically to stabilise the building and search for people involved. We&#8217;d ask for people to avoid the area at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said a child and four adults were rescued in the initial stages, at the rear of the property, using a ladder, while a further 14 adults and two children self evacuated from surrounding properties.</p>
<p>Pictures taken behind the property show debris jutting out of the building.</p>
<p>LFB said it was called just before 6.40am, adding that six fire engines and about 40 firefighters are at the scene. LFB&#8217;s specialist urban search and rescue (USAR) crews are carrying out the operation.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the windows of the shop were &#8220;completely blown out&#8221; in the incident.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan police said the incident was not being treated as suspicious and was believed to be a gas explosion.</p>
<p>The force said a large explosion was found to have taken place inside a shop and a man was found injured.</p>
<p>A London ambulance service spokeswoman said one person had been treated and discharged, and staff were continuing to work with other emergency services at the scene.</p>

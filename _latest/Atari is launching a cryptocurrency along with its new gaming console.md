<div><p>Atari isn&#8217;t just getting back in the console game after two decades on the sidelines &#8212; it&#8217;s jumping headfirst into cryptocurrency, too.</p>
<p>The retro gaming giant is introducing a digital currency called Atari Token, which users will be able to use to buy games on its new Atari VCS gaming system.</p>
<p>The tokens will sell for 25 cents a pop beginning Oct. 29 on the Bitcoin.com Exchange, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-16/atari-seeks-new-cachet-with-crypto-and-a-return-to-hardware?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=rEjryNCU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reports</a>, and Atari will sell 4 million of them. Though they will initially only be used to buy games and for in-game purchases on its console, the hope is that the token will eventually be used throughout gaming.</p>
<p>The VCS, which was <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/26/atari-new-console-does-much-more-than-just-video-games/">first announced in 2017,</a> will be released the same month as <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/17/sonys-playstation-5-to-cost-499-will-be-released-nov-12/">Sony&#8217;s new PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/09/microsoft-confirms-its-499-next-gen-xbox-will-arrive-nov-10/">Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Series X</a>. But despite the top-tier competition, CEO Frederic Chesnais said Atari will be able to make a splash.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a brand, we have a following &#8212; we think we are going to get some attention in any case,&#8221; Chesnais told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>The console will be offered as part of a bundle that includes 100 classic games, as well as two controllers, for $390.</p>
<p>The VCS has a retro look and feel, will run on a Linux-based operating system and promises &#8220;a full PC experience for the TV&#8221; that can handle streaming, apps, social media, web browsing and music, Atari said.</p>

At a European leaders’ summit that ended Friday, the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus was on stark display as two leaders had to rush out of their meeting room after each was notified of having been in contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.

Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin was the latest to depart early Friday, exiting the oval meeting room in Brussels that the 27 leaders of the European Union had tried to turn into a virus-free cocoon to negotiate thorny issues such as the pandemic response and Brexit.

The Finnish leader attended a parliamentary committee meeting in Helsinki on Wednesday with a lawmaker who tested positive for the coronavirus. Marin flew home to Helsinki, where she planned to take a coronavirus test and quarantine.

She joined European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in viral purgatory, after von der Leyen on Thursday rushed out of the meeting not long after it started. A member of her front office tested positive. It is her second quarantine this month.

Leaders met virtually starting in March, but they resumed their regular in-person conclaves in July after discovering the difficulty of handling controversial subjects by secure video link. The meetings always implied a risk, but the leaders decided it was worth it.

As a second wave of the pandemic washes over Europe, the meetings seemed increasingly risky. One scheduled for last month had to be postponed for a week after European Council President Charles Michel quarantined after his security guard tested positive.

And now Brussels, the typical location for the meetings, is one of the worst hot spots in Europe, with more than 1,000 cases diagnosed each day over the past week in the city.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had warned against holding the summit in person.

“There are some discussions where one needs to be brought a little closer to each other. And then there are other meetings where you can do it as a video conference,” she told Danish reporters after touching down in Brussels, the Associated Press reported.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell skipped this week’s meeting because they were quarantining.

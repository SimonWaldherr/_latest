The BBC is to target its diversity drive at news and current affairs after figures showed the department has the highest proportion of privately-educated staff.

Data from the corporation’s Equality Information Report found that 22.7 per cent of employees in the news division went to independent or fee-paying schools. In the management ranks, the figure is 34.7 per cent.

Another 26.4 per cent of employees attended state-funded selective schools, with 50.9 per cent educated at comprehensive schools.

Managers in news and current affairs are also more likely than any other department to come from families in which at least one parent had a university degree (39.2 per cent).

Across the BBC, 15 per cent of staff hired in the past 12 months attended private schools. The national average is around six per cent.

Tim Davie, the director-general, signalled this week that the BBC was changing its recruitment process to hire people from more diverse educational backgrounds. “It can’t be that we just take people from a certain academic track,” he said.

Privately-educated BBC news staff include its main political interviewer, Andrew Marr, political and deputy political editors, Laura Kuenssberg and Vicki Young; Jo Coburn, presenter of Politics Live; and every presenter of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Emily Maitlis, is one of the few high profile news presenters to attend a state school. But she is an Oxbridge graduate, in common with many of her colleagues.

Mr Davie has signalled a desire to reduce the number of Oxbridge recruits, to recruit more non-graduates and to change the face of BBC management.

Speaking at an Ofcom debate earlier this week, he said: “Speeches are great, but we need to be judged by actions. At the end of the day, if you don’t have enough diversity in your leadership, people don’t believe you.”

Among those commenting on Mr Davie’s words on Thursday was Sima Kotecha, the BBC News correspondent, who tweeted: “Working class background. State school educated. Didn’t go to Oxbridge. Was definitely not an A grade student. If I can do it, so can you.”

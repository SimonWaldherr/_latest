President Donald Trump is unhappy with a new presidential debate format announced Thursday morning that would have both candidates appearing virtually, telling an interviewer he would not agree to the new terms written after he was hospitalized for the coronavirus.

"I'm not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That's not what debating is all about," Trump said during an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced in a statement that the Oct. 15 event would go the way of Americans' work and social lives since the pandemic – a virtual debate with both candidates appearing remotely.

"In order to protect the health and safety of all involved with the second presidential debate, scheduled for October 15, 2020 … the second presidential debate will take the form of a town meeting, in which the candidates would participate from separate remote locations."

The town meeting participants and the moderator, Steve Scully of C-SPAN, will be on site at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County in Miami, the commission said. The White House press pool will provide coverage of the event.

But soon after the announcement, Trump nixed the idea during the television interview, leaving in doubt the fate of the second scheduled debate. Nonetheless, Trump said on the program that he is "looking forward to doing the rallies."

Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien – who has tested positive for COVID – put out a statement saying "we'll pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead." Candidates are not required to participate in debates.

The Biden campaign, which had accepted the new format, said it was ready to go with the commission’s plan.

“Vice President Biden looks forward to speaking directly to the American people and comparing his plan for bringing the country together and building back better with Donald Trump's failed leadership on the coronavirus that has thrown the strong economy he inherited into the worst downturn since the Great Depression,” campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfeld said in a statement.

The commission's announcement comes the morning after the vice presidential debate, when Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris of California were separated by 12 feet and plexiglass dividers. That latter accommodation, initially opposed by the Pence team, was made after Trump was hospitalized with COVID-19.

Even with the virus, Trump has continued to downplay the severity of the illness, telling viewers in a video after he returned, "Don't be afraid of COVID," and to not let the virus run their lives. In another video Wednesday, hours before the vice presidential face-off, Trump said his illness may have been a "blessing from God" because it elevated Regeneron, a still unproven drug to treat COVID-19, as a cure.

Next Thursday's debate presented Trump with a conundrum: if he attended in person, he risked worsening his own health and potentially infecting others. But not attending would remind Americans of the deadliness of the virus, which has killed more than 212,000 Americans. The virtual format makes it easier for Trump to participate without the personal or public health implications of an on-site appearance.

Democratic nominee Joe Biden – who took part in an individual town hall Monday night in Miami on NBC – has tended to do better in town hall formats, where he can connect personally with voters and express empathy. But appearing virtually denies Biden of that personal connection.

  Coronavirus live updates: Obama blasts Trump on covid-19 response 
description: > 
  Wearing a mask can reduce the cloud of contaminated air a sick person ejects from their mouth as they cough by seven times, according to a new study that measures the flow of air from coughing and its implications for stopping the spread of the coronavirus.The volume of a person’s “cough cloud” is about seven times larger when they are not wearing a surgical mask than when they are, researchers found, according to findings published online Tuesday in the journal Physics of Fluids.The effects were even greater in N95 respirators, the filtering masks that have become the world’s most reliable defense against the virus, and that remain in short supply.The study showed cough clouds were 23 times larger when a person is not wearing an N95 than when a person is, according to the study.“The presence of a mask drastically reduces this volume and, consequently, significantly cuts down the risk of the infection to the other persons present in the room,” wrote co-authors Amit Agrawal and Rajneesh Bhardwaj of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

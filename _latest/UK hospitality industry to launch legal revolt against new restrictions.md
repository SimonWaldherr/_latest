The UK hospitality industry will launch a legal challenge against the Government to prevent further lockdown restrictions.

Following the announcement of a new three-tier lockdown system, which will see areas with higher Covid rates imposed with harsher measures, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) is leading a revolt against new rules that could see thousands of bars and restaurants ordered to close.

Two of the country’s biggest brewers and pub operators, Joseph Holt and JW Lees, are also involved in the challenge, alongside a further 10 hospitality businesses and organisations.

Sacha Lord, the night time economy advisor for Greater Manchester and one of those spearheading the resistance, said: “Once again the Government wants to shut down pubs and bars, but this cannot keep happening and we need to understand why the hospitality industry is being isolated like this – where is the scientific evidence to suggest closing venues suppresses transmission?”

The new restrictions, while not yet confirmed, are expected to hit large swathes of the north of England where the Covid-19 infection rate is growing fastest.

Proposed measures include a ban on households mixing indoors or outdoors, and another ban on people staying overnight outside their area of residence, with each local lockdown running in four-week blocks.

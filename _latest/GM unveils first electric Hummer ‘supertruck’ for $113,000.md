<div><p>General Motors has resurrected its gas-guzzling Hummer SUV as an all-electric &#8220;supertruck&#8221; &#8212; souped up with high-tech features and a price to match.</p>
<p>The Detroit automaker on Tuesday <a href="https://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/oct/1020-hummer.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the first of four Hummer models that it will produce to compete with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/elon-musk-unveils-cybertruck-at-tesla-event-but-bulletproof-window-test-is-a-bust/">Tesla&#8217;s futuristic Cybertruck</a>&#160;in the budding electric pickup market.</p>
<p>The GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 is the top-of-the-line version, offering a battery range of more than 350 miles and a three-motor, 1,000-horsepower four-wheel-drive system.</p>
<p>It will also come loaded with features &#8220;developed to challenge tough obstacles and terrain,&#8221; such as a &#8220;CrabWalk&#8221; steering system that will let the truck drive diagonally over difficult ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had one goal for Hummer EV: Build the most capable factory truck &#8212; ever,&#8221; Al Oppenheiser, GMC&#8217;s chief engineer for the Hummer EV, said in a statement, calling his creation &#8220;an absolute off-road beast.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a starting retail price of $112,595, the Hummer will be far more expensive than Tesla&#8217;s high-end Cybertruck, which will boast a range of more than 500 miles for $69,900. But that hefty price tag didn&#8217;t stop reservations for the Hummer from <a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric-truck/hummer-ev/reserve-now" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filling up</a> within hours after they opened Tuesday night.</p>
<p>GM aims to start producing the Edition 1 &#8212; which will be the first all-electric vehicle in GMC&#8217;s portfolio &#8212; in late 2021 at its Factory ZERO facility in Detroit. The automaker expects to roll out three lower-priced Hummers in the coming years, starting with a $99,995 version in fall 2022, followed by a $89,995 truck in spring 2023 and a $79,995 model in spring 2024.</p>

 
	<p>GM is one of several automakers trying to electrify the lucrative pickup truck market in the US. Ford is developing an electric version of its F-150 &#8212; the nation&#8217;s top-selling vehicle &#8212; as newer players such as Tesla and <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/27/tesla-shares-fall-as-electric-pickup-truck-competition-heats-up/">Rivian</a> roll out their own models.</p>
<p>GM is also in talks to manufacture the Badger pickup model for Nikola, the Phoenix-based electric-vehicle startup that&#8217;s been plagued by fraud and sexual assault allegations against <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/01/who-is-nikola-founder-trevor-milton/">its founder and former chairman, Trevor Milton</a>. The two companies <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/08/gm-takes-2-billion-stake-in-nikola-electric-rival-to-tesla/">announced a $2 billion partnership</a> last month, but they have yet to formally close the deal.</p>

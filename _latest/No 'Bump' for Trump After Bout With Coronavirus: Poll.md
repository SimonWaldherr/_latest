President Donald Trump saw no boost in the polls from sympathetic respondents as a result of his recent coronavirus illness, with nearly two-thirds of Americans surveyed saying that he hasn't taken the pandemic seriously enough.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Thursday found that 65% of Americans say Trump hasn't taken the pandemic seriously enough, and 66% disapprove of how he is handling it.

The poll, conducted from Oct. 8-12 – after Trump was released from a hospital where he was treated for COVID-19 – shows disapproval of his handling of the pandemic to be 6 points higher than the 60% figure notched the month before . The survey showed that disapproval with Trump's overall job performance had also escalated, from 56% in September to 61% this month.

The figures mark a troubling trend for Trump, for whom the handling of the virus has been a significant impediment to his reelection bid. However, opinions diverge along party lines.

Seventy percent of Republicans support the way Trump has handled the coronavirus pandemic compared to 4% of Democrats. While 28% of Republicans disapprove of his handling of the outbreak, 97% of Democrats say the same.

A majority of Republicans approve of Trump's response to COVID-19, but they are less supportive about how his administration handled the president's own virus diagnosis. Fifty-five percent of Republicans approve of the way the Trump administration handled the president's COVID-19 diagnosis, compared to 21 who disapprove.

Among Democrats, 3% approve and 84% disapprove. Similar percentages say they trust information coming from the White House about the president's diagnosis.

Half of Republicans trust the information a great deal or quite a bit, compared to 2% of Democrats who say the same. Nineteen percent of Republicans say they only trust the information regarding the president's diagnosis a little or not at all, compared to 89% of Democrats who say the same, according to the poll.

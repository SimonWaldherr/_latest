<div><p>Borrowing a line from &#8220;The Godfather,&#8221; Dr. Anthony Fauci reacted to President Trump&#8217;s takedowns by saying that the presidential broadsides were &#8220;nothing personal, strictly business,&#8221; according to a report.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/trump-tells-staff-were-going-to-win-during-internal-call/">skewered the nation&#8217;s top infectious diseases expert</a> Monday, telling his campaign staff that &#8220;people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people that have gotten it wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calling the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases a &#8220;nice guy,&#8221;<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/trump-piles-on-fauci-over-first-pitch-and-covid-19-response/"> the president also described him as a &#8220;disaster.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d listened to him, we&#8217;d have 500,000 deaths,&#8221; the president added.</p>
<p>During an interview with Southern California radio station KNX1070 on Monday, the doctor was asked to comment on Trump&#8217;s attacks, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/521778-fauci-quotes-the-godfather-in-response-to-latest-trump-attacks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hill reported</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>&#8220;I would prefer not to comment on that and just get on with what we are really trying to do and what we are trying to do is to protect the health and welfare and safety of the American people predominantly, and ultimately, of the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing an uptick in cases &#8212; higher than they&#8217;ve ever been. Many, many states that had been doing reasonably well are now showing upticks, that&#8217;s what we should be concentrating on,&#8221; Fauci said.</p>
<p>He added that he doesn&#8217;t want to create a &#8220;me against the president&#8221; mentality.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Addressing the virus is] the only thing I really care about. That other stuff, it&#8217;s like in &#8216;The Godfather&#8217;: Nothing personal, strictly business as far as I&#8217;m concerned,&#8221; Fauci said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just want to do my job and take care of the people of this country,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The president targeted Fauci after the doctor said on CBS&#8217; &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; that he was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/fauci-says-he-is-absolutely-not-surprised-that-trump-got-covid-19/">not surprised Trump caught the bug</a> after a White House event announcing Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.</p>

<p>From the beauty of everyday life to the mystery of an electronic instrument celebrating 100 years, there's lots to discover on today's All Songs Considered.</p>   <p>The song "Living Life," by Steady Holiday, is a joyful tune inspired by "A Day in the Life" by The Beatles. The song, "Robber," by The Weather Station, is a complexly layered tune, lyrically and musically, where conflicting ideologies collide. On the other end of complexity, we have a simple tune that conjures the Everly Brothers' sounds. It's a long-distance collaboration between New Zealand's Marlon Williams and the duo of cousins from Saskatoon, Kacy and Clayton. I also have a conversation with Marlon and Kacy about their work together.</p>   <p>The second half of the show is both spiritual and full of wonder. I begin with music from the artist known as MILCK. She was powerfully moved by hearing <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/09/25/916868004/i-have-no-faith-in-the-legal-system-breonna-taylor-s-mother-says">Breonna Taylor's mom talk</a> about her daughter's life; we hear the anthemic and moving song, "Somebody's Beloved."</p>   <p>The Theremin is an electronic instrument controlled by waving your hands in the air around metal antennas, controlling pitch and volume. We hear Claude Debussy's "Claire de Lune" performed on the Theremin by French musician Gr&#233;goire Blanc. And I close out the set with the evocative sounds of Mary Lattimore performing on the harp, from a new album called Silver Ladders. A majestic ending to this auditory adventure. </p>

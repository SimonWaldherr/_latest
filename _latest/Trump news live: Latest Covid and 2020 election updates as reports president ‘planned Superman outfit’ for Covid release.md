US president Donald Trump on Sunday claimed to be ‘immune’ to Covid-19

Donald Trump reportedly planned to emerge from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week by tearing open his shirt to reveal a Superman logo, a celebratory stunt he ultimately abandoned after being advised against it by aides with one eye on the mounting US death toll from the pandemic.

The president’s re-election campaign is meanwhile in dispute with the respected Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, after it used his words out of context in a political ad to make it appear as though he were praising Trump. “In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate," Dr Fauci said in response.

The president has also fallen foul of Twitter once again, as the social media site labelled one of his tweets proclaiming that he is now “immune” from Covid-19 “misleading” and “potentially harmful” to the American public.

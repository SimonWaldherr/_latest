The NYPD released surveillance video Wednesday of a violent mugger who allegedly pulled off eight robberies in the subway in the Bronx since August — stabbing one victim repeatedly while removing his property at a station in Mott Haven.

“Are you O.K., my friend?” the mugger asked a 44-year-old man on the southbound No. 6 train platform of the Brook Avenue subway station, around 6 p.m. Aug. 25, according to police.

“Give me everything you have.”

The robber whipped out a knife and stabbed the victim multiple times in the side “causing lacerations and bleeding,” cops said.

He snatched the victim’s wallet, cash and cell phone and ran away. EMS responded and transported the victim to Lincoln hospital in serious but stable condition. The property stolen had a total estimated value of approximately $1,400, cops said.

The same suspect is wanted in seven other incidents in the borough. Each time he threatens with a knife and removes cell phones and wallets. None of the other victims were injured.

The robberies happened at various times of day and night.

The first one occurred at the Pelham Parkway subway station around 5:50 a.m. Aug. 10 — the victim a 54-year-old man waiting on the northbound No. 2 train. The robber took the victim’s wallet, cash and cell phone worth about $400.

Five days later, the same robber is believed to have struck around noon inside of the Gun Hill subway station as a 44-year-old man waited for a No. 2 train. The knife-wielding man took the victim’s wallet, cash and cell phone, valued at about $500.

One day later, on Aug. 16, the same brute is suspected of robbing a 44-year-old man as he stood on the platform for the northbound No. 6 subway inside the Whitlock Avenue subway station, cops said. The victim was robbed of about $1,200 worth of property.

The same robber is suspected of stealing about $300 from a 44-year-old man on the street in the area of Olinville Avenue and East 219 Street at 2 a.m. Aug. 28.

Then, on Sept. 26, a 26-year-old man was standing on platform on the No. 2/5 line when he was approached by a man believed to be the same robber. He was forced to give up about $1,100 in property, cops said.

The robber struck again around 10 p.m. Oct. 1 inside the 219 street subway station when he approached a 26-year old male victim on the northbound No. 2 line platform displayed a knife and demanded everything he had.

The brute’s last known robbery took place just after midnight on Oct. 2 inside the Gun Hill Road subway station, as a 20-year-old man waited for a northbound No. 2 train, cops said. The creep forcibly removed the victim’s wallet and electronics and took off running with about $600 worth of cash and property, police said.

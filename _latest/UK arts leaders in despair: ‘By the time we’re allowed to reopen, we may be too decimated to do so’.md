  UK arts leaders in despair: ‘By the time we’re allowed to reopen, we may be too decimated to do so’

Just weeks ago, Oliver Dowden announced Operation Sleeping Beauty – the panto-styled aim to get our beleaguered cultural venues refilling by Christmas. But, following the Prime Minister’s unveiling of strict new Covid-19 guidelines, it now looks like the sector will be left slumbering for at least another six months – and Rishi Sunak’s winter economic aid, announced today, has failed to give it a wake-up call.

The Chancellor singled out hospitality and tourism as two sectors particularly affected by the pandemic, but other than an extension of the VAT cut – which Dowden tweeted as “more evidence that the Government is on your side” – there was nothing to help the arts.

That seems patently unfair: this once-booming sector is only in trouble because of Government-mandated rules. As Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, says: “Most other sectors have been back in some form of activity for some time. We have very minor activity in the arts – probably less than 1 per cent of what we normally do.

“The sector is basically still shut, and it looks like it’ll remain like this until next spring. This is a sector that is hugely generative of tax normally, and boosts the UK’s reputation around the world.”

In the Commons today, when Stephen Farry MP asked Sunak about help for businesses that could not pay a third of salaries, and so would not receive additional support from the Government – one of the Chancellor’s winter measures – Sunak replied that the creative industries had already been given a £1.57 billion rescue package, and that support would now be “focused on those who can provide viable jobs with a genuinely secure future for their employees”. It’s an extraordinary dismissal for a massively successful sector that is crippled by unforeseen Covid restrictions – none of their own making.

The Chancellor’s plans also leave many individual arts workers – who are neither employed full-time by a venue, nor qualify for the self-employment scheme – falling through the cracks yet again. But, when challenged on the point, Sunak simply said the eligibility would “remain the same, with some refinements”.

Likewise, the new 10pm curfew announced earlier this week doesn’t apply to arts venues directly, but it’s not exactly confidence-boosting. “It’s knocked us all for six,” admits Tamara Harvey, artistic director of Theatr Clwyd in Wales. “We’re eternal optimists – a bad dress rehearsal means a good performance, the show must go on – but it’s really frustrating.”

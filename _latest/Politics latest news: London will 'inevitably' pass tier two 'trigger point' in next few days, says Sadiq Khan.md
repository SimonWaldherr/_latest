It is "inevitable" that London will pass a "trigger point" to enter a higher tier of coronavirus restrictions in the "next few days", Sadiq Khan has said.

The Mayor of London said he was "angry" with the Government for having redeployed tests away from the capital, as this meant there was a less accurate understanding of the transmission rate, although he estimated it at around 90 per 100,000.

Other indicators including hospitalisations were "going in the wrong direction", he said.

"Which means, I'm afraid, it's inevitable over the course of the next few days London will have passed a trigger point to be in the second tier," Mr Khan told Sky News.

Council leaders across the city were "keen to go as one" to avoid "the complexities and the confusion" of having different rules, he added.

"Many Londoners work in one borough, live in another borough, study in another borough, go to a restaurant in another borough so we're really keen to go as one city."

<div><p>A now-former sheriff&#8217;s deputy in Florida was arrested Sunday after allegedly performing an exorcism on a child, and telling another there were demons in his home and to shoot anyone who entered.</p>
<p>Christopher Dougherty, 37, was arrested on child abuse allegations the same day he was fired from the Orange County Sheriff&#8217;s Office on an unrelated matter, according to the agency. He had worked with the sheriff&#8217;s office since 2006.</p>
<p>Deputies responded Thursday to a 911 call about a residential alarm and determined there was evidence of child abuse at the apartment occupied by Dougherty.</p>
<p>A girl, wearing body armor and a Kevlar helmet, was lying on the ground in a shooting position with a rifle. A boy was armed with a Taser, and Dougherty was in possession of a handgun, <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ne-orange-deputy-arrested-child-abuse-20201019-zpnyrje32zbwvobb67ihd4ch6q-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Orlando Sentinel reported</a>, citing the arrest affidavit.</p>
<p>The children told investigators Dougherty performed an exorcism on the boy before telling the girl that there were demons in the home and directing her to shoot anyone who entered.</p>
<p>Dougherty was detained and taken to a hospital where he was held <a href="https://ufhealth.org/baker-act#:~:text=The%20Baker%20Act%20is%20a,determine%20their%20needs%20for%20treatment." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under the Baker Act</a>, a Florida law enabling those determined likely to inflict harm to themselves or others to receive emergency mental health services, the Orange County Sheriff&#8217;s Office told Fox News. He was arrested Sunday after his release.</p>
<p>Dougherty was also terminated from the Orange County Sheriff&#8217;s Office Sunday for &#8220;an unsatisfactory performance finding in a separate matter,&#8221; the agency said, without providing details.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this deputy was terminated for a pattern of unsatisfactory performance, these are very serious criminal allegations,&#8221; Sheriff John Mina said in a statement to Fox News. &#8220;As law enforcement officers, we are held to the highest standards of conduct whether on duty or off duty. But we are also concerned about the deputy&#8217;s mental health.&#8221;</p>
<p>The relationship between Dougherty and the two children remained unclear.</p>
<p>Dougherty was hired in January 2006 and worked in the uniform patrol division.</p>

<div><p>A Maryland man &#8220;upset at the political situation&#8221; was charged by federal authorities with threatening to kidnap &#8220;Grandpa Biden&#8221; and rape his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, and then kill them both, according to a report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>James Dale Reed, 42, allegedly dropped a letter detailing the threats on the doorstop of a home with Biden/Harris campaign signs in Frederick on Oct. 4, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-cr-man-charged-biden-threats-20201021-kg3ooraih5d77iovxfjlnko77i-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Baltimore Sun reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a list of homes and addresses by your election signs. We are the ones with those scary guns, We are the ones your children have nightmares about. The Boogeymen coming in the night,&#8221; Reed wrote, according to court documents.</p>
<p>He was spotted on a security camera leaving the home.</p>
<p>Reed admitted to writing the letter when interviewed after being picked up by local police last week.</p>
<p>He was being held without bond.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said he didn&#8217;t know the homeowner and planned to leave the letter at the first home he came to in his hometown with campaign signs for former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
 
<p>He told prosecutors that he was &#8220;upset at the political situation&#8221; and explained that &#8220;this will happen &#8230; due to the political climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>US Attorney for Maryland Robert Hur said he takes such threats &#8220;extremely seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conduct like this that threatens major candidates and fellow citizens only undermines our democracy and the principles upon which America was founded. We will not tolerate threatening conduct that seeks to intimidate, harass or dissuade Americans from exercising their right to vote,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The incident comes just weeks after the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/13/militia-member-planned-to-pose-as-pizza-worker-to-kill-whitmer/">feds busted plots</a> by militia groups to kidnap Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

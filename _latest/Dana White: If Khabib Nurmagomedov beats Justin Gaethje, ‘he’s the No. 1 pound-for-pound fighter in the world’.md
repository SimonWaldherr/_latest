<div><p id="EXSXsx"><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1480/khabib-nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov&#8217;s</a> august resume is rightly in the spotlight at UFC 254. </p>
<p id="6IlZuZ">He&#8217;s 28-0 as a professional fighter with 12 straight wins in the UFC including three consecutive wins in title fights. Nurmagomedov has only lost one round during his entire MMA career &#8212; the third round in his showdown with <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1859/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> &#8212; and he finished the fight with a rear-naked choke in the fourth.</p>
<p id="cKXqHp">Nurmagomedov is also one more win away from tying the all-time record for title defenses in the UFC lightweight division.</p>
<p id="6ePYOi">This weekend at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1140/ufc-254">UFC 254</a>, Nurmagomedov squares off against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1526/justin-gaethje">Justin Gaethje</a>, who&#8217;s been a human highlight reel ever since he arrived in the promotion. Gaethje has racked up nine post fight bonuses in just seven fights.</p>
<p id="AYW2uW">He also stopped <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/538/anthony-ferguson">Tony Ferguson</a>&#8217;s 12-fight winning streak in his previous performance, also claiming the UFC interim lightweight title.</p>
<p id="Etdybl">Considering the accolades Nurmagomedov has already accomplished and Gaethje&#8217;s eye-popping performances, UFC President <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a> believes the stakes for this fight are even higher when it comes to the undefeated Russian&#8217;s legacy.</p>
<p id="DwMQhB">&#8220;Khabib is looking down the barrel of not only the greatest to ever do it in this division, but listen, I think if he beats Justin on Saturday, he&#8217;s the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world and he&#8217;s on his way to GOAT status,&#8221; White said during the UFC 254 pre-fight press conference.</p>
<p id="Ke0Qqd">The mythical pound-for-pound list is purely subjective with no real criteria to determine rankings. But White feels like Nurmagomedov&#8217;s accomplishments speak for themselves.</p>
<p id="Et9A13">In the past, the UFC figurehead has routinely referred to former light heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/47/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> as the top fighter in the sport regardless of weight class. But now,  Nurmagomedov seems to be knocking on the door to take that title away from him.</p>
<p id="hlIpJj">&#8220;You know what I think of Jon Jones and we always talk about what Jon&#8217;s accomplished in his career,&#8221; White explained. &#8220;Look at how many fights this guy has and he&#8217;s still undefeated, and this is a nasty, nasty weight division.&#8221;</p>
<p id="glHswV">In addition to his status as one of the best fighters in the sport, Nurmagomedov has also become one of the UFC&#8217;s biggest draws over the past few years.</p>
<p id="npFlED">He already participated in the highest selling pay-per-view in UFC history with his 2018 fight against Conor McGregor. White has already teased that the upcoming card featuring Nurmagomedov vs. Gaethje is trending into record-breaking territory.</p>
<p id="rLSxW9">Add to that, the UFC president says every possible metric the promotion can measure shows Nurmagomedov turning into a true global superstar.</p>
<p id="gfh17c">&#8220;He&#8217;s one of the biggest stars in the sport,&#8221; White said. &#8220;Khabib&#8217;s videos have generated 222 million views. His content that features him, over 100 million video views just this year alone, just on Facebook. He&#8217;s broken records on Instagram. I could just rattle off numbers all day. He&#8217;s by far the No. 1 most played character in the video game globally. By a long shot.</p>
<p id="YBgYvU">&#8220;The numbers just go on and on. I could go on for days. The kid&#8217;s broken a lot of records.&#8221;</p>

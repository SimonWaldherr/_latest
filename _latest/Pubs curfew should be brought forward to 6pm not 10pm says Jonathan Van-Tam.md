  Pubs curfew should be brought forward to 6pm not 10pm says Jonathan Van-Tam 
description: > 
  AdvertisementEngland's deputy chief medical officer has called for the nation's 10pm pub curfew to be brought forward to 6pm in an effort to reduce the increasing rates of transmission, according to reports.When asked if the 10pm curfew reduced the rates of coronavirus transmission, the professor said: 'Not really.'Venues across the capital saw significantly reduced footfall meaning revenues slumped by 85% in central London.'Under Tier Two restrictions, households are also banned from meeting indoors, even in hospitality venues.A group of people sit outside as London heads into day two of the Tier Two lockdown.

and restaurants under the new Tier Two restrictions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the evening scenes, hospitality bosses warned yesterday that central London revenues had fallen 85 per cent during the first day of new restrictions, while bosses warned that 200,000 jobs could be lost this weekend alone.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Soho, famous for its thriving nightlife, was pedestrianised when the national lockdown started to lift at the start of summer so its eateries and bars could set tables up in the street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Kate Nicholls, Chief Executive of UKHospitality, said&#160;that revenue across bars and restaurants in central London had still plunged by 85 per cent as less people took to venues under new restrictions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said: 'The first day of Tier 2 restrictions saw the hospitality sector's worst fears confirmed with a 50 per cent increase in cancellations and a fall in forward bookings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Venues across the capital saw significantly reduced footfall meaning revenues slumped by 85% in central London.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Nicholls continued: 'That is clearly unsustainable and businesses in London are now planning to close their doors and shutter their sites, with forecasts of up to 200,000 job losses unless enhanced JSS is extended.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Chief Executive of UKHospitality added that the move two Tier Two was a 'curse' for businesses in the capital and would leave them 'trapped in no man's land'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added: 'Being moved into tier 2 is a curse for businesses. They will be trapped in a no man's land of being open, but with severe restrictions that will significantly hit custom, all while unable to access the job support available in tier 3. It is the worst of both worlds for businesses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Venues in London have already taken a hit due to the dip in inbound tourism and with people increasingly working from home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A move into tier 2 will now be catastrophic for some of them and it is only going to be made worse by the end of the furlough scheme in under two weeks.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week the Prime Minister divided the country into 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' alert sectors after after a 9.3 per cent increase in cases on the

title: > 
  Liverpool's Joe Gomez and Fabinho step up against Ajax 
description: > 
  There were only 90 seconds on the clock but a few significant reactions made you wonder if what was going to be one of those nights.The eye was drawn to Joe Gomez, who was scowling and gesticulating; Fabinho looked exasperated, Adrian - in his canary yellow goalkeeper kit - pointed and barked.Fortunately for Klopp, who was a coiled spring throughout, the early aberration in Amsterdam did not set the tone.It would be wrong to say it was entirely plain-sailing but, for the first night without their defensive totem, Liverpool's defence emerged with credit.Fabinho and Gomez were helped by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson, who patrolled the flanks with diligence and discipline, while the relentless work of Gini Wijnaldum also made things a little easier for them.

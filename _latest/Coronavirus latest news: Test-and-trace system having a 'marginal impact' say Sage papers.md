The test-and-trace system is only having a "marginal impact" on reducing the spread of coronavirus, key scientists advising the Government have said.

The programme will "further decline" unless it grows at the same rate as the epidemic, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned in documents released on Monday.

Boris Johnson has promised the scheme would be "world beating", while experts and politicians alike see it as a major way of reducing the severity of restrictions imposed during the crisis.

The Sage scientists wrote: "The relatively low levels of engagement with the system... coupled with testing delays and likely poor rates of adherence with self-isolation suggests that this system is having a marginal impact on transmission at the moment."

Elsewhere, it has emerged that Mr Johnson overruled Government scientists who pressed for national lockdown measures such as stopping all household mixing and closing all pubs.

Papers from Sage show that the body called for an immediate introduction of national interventions, saying failure to take such measures could result in "a very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences".

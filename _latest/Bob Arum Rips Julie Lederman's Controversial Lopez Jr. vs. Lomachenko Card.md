  Bob Arum Rips Julie Lederman's Controversial Lopez Jr. vs. Lomachenko Card 
description: > 
  Nick Wass/Associated PressTeofimo Lopez defeated Vasiliy Lomachenko to become the undisputed lightweight champion, but the scoring of the unanimous decision raised question marks.Saturday's bout was scored 116-112, 117-111 and 119-109 by the three judges, with judge Julie Lederman responsible for the final score.Top Rank CEO Bob Arum was harsh in his assessment of the scoring, even if the winner was correct.But you can't score it 11 rounds to 1 and say you watched the fight," Arum said, per Mike Coppinger of The Athletic.Lopez certainly had the advantage early on, which even Lomachenko admitted, although he felt he came on strong in the final rounds.

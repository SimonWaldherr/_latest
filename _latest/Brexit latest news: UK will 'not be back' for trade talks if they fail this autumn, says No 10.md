<p>The UK &#8220;will not be back to negotiate next year&#8221; if a post-Brexit trade deal is not secured in the coming days, Downing Street has warned.&#160;</p>
<p>Boris Johnson last week told the UK to start preparing for a no deal after saying Brussels had not shown sufficient flexibility by his nominal deadline of October 15.&#160;</p>
<p>His spokesman today did not rule out talks ongoing over further weeks, although stressed the ratification process would take &#8220;a period of time&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;We have been repeatedly clear that any agreement will need to be in place before the end of the transition period. We will not be back to negotiate further next year. We must provide assurance and certainty to our businesses and citizens and endless prolonged negotiations won't achieve this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two chief negotiators, David Frost and Michel Barnier, are due to speak via phone today, after a face-to-face meeting was downgraded following the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement on Friday.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our view is that if the EU is willing to change their position then we are willing to talk to them,&#8221; said the spokesman. &#8220;But they must be ready to discuss the detailed legal texts of the treaty in all areas with a genuine wish to find a deal and respect UK sovereignty and independence.&#8221; &#160; &#160;</p>
<p>Asked he meant that leaving without a deal would preclude one from being struck next year, he said &#8220;correct&#8221;.&#160;</p>
<p>He declined to respond to an admission by Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary,&#160;that the difference between an Australia-style deal and a no deal was "semantics".&#160;</p>

PALM TREE, N.Y. — In this town of 26,000 residents, where life revolves around family, religious services and prayer, the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive is at least 15 percent, among the highest in New York. There are more than 200 active cases, enough to place this Orthodox Jewish community northwest of New York City into a state-ordered “red zone” with strict new restrictions on synagogue capacity and public gatherings.

And yet on Wednesday, as men and boys streamed out of prayer services at Congregation Yetev Lev D’Satmar for the holiday of Sukkot, the vast majority were not wearing face masks.

Dina Aker, 67, walked by the synagogue, also not wearing a mask. Her husband, 73, had caught the coronavirus in May, despite, according to Mrs. Aker, being mainly confined to their home. That left her feeling that there was no utility to masks, and that new lockdown measures would serve to only prolong the spread of the disease.

“It’s better that everybody should have it and the thing is finished,” Mrs. Aker said. “I pray every day, ‘Please, my lovely God, make it finish.’”

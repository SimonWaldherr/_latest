Helena Christensen looked effortlessly chic as she walked her beloved Australian Shepard, Kuma, around New York City on Saturday afternoon.

Enjoying the fresh air, the 51-year-old beauty flaunted her sensational figure in a pair of high-waisted white linen trousers and an unbuttoned blue-grey blouse.

The Danish supermodel added a brown leather belt to her classic ensemble, which coordinated with the star's tiny purse and emphasized her slender waist.

Additionally, she let her lengthy brown tresses blow in the wind, while donning a pair of large rose-tinted shades and a cloth face mask.

Christensen held onto her adorable pup with a light pink leash, as they soaked in the breathtaking views of the Hudson River, before heading home.

While she has taken trips into the city amid the coronavirus pandemic, she has been spending the majority under lockdown at her home in the Catskills.

In addition to hosting a few of her close friends, her 20-year-old son Mingus has also been quarantining with the star in upstate New York.

Speaking with The Telegraph in August, she explained they have been passing the time by watching films and exploring the outdoors.

'Being in nature saved me physically and mentally,' the Victoria's Secret model told the outlet. 'Being in nature I realize is as important to me as breathing.'

Helena said: 'I was lucky to spend months on end [in lockdown] with close friends and my son Mingus.... it was very special.'

She also detailed how she stayed fit, over the summer, by taking a swim every day in a nearby river no matter how cold it was.

The UNHCR Goodwill ambassador noted that she has a 'deep need to be immersed in water' to let it 'wash away' her 'dark thoughts.'

As well as swimming, Helena said that she's been doing lunges, jumps and squats.

Helena shares her son with her ex-partner the American actor Norman Reedus, who is known for his role in The Walking Dead. The couple were together for five years, but split in 2003.

Mingus, who is with the Unsigned Group modelling agency, is also making a name for himself in the fashion industry after walking in several high profile runway shows.

She also revealed that social media is one of her biggest worries as a mother, but said that parents have to try and 'open their minds'.

The stunner explained that it is a part of the world young people have grown up in and it is important to try and understand it from their point of view.

She frequently models for campaigns that support refugees, climate change awareness and animals rights.

Keeping fit: Helena also said that 'being in nature has saved her physically and mentally' during lockdown and said she's been working out regularly

In late September, she took stunning snaps of Brooke Shields for a swimsuit shoot.

'A great friend and a dream collaborator,' Shields wrote, adding: 'thank you for believing in my vision and helping bring it to life,' and tagging Helena.

After becoming a star as a model Helena also broke into photography and previously snapped Brooke for Reserved magazine.

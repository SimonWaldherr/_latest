"The notion that these companies owed no duty to protect Mr. Safechuck &#8212; who was a young boy working for them at the time &#8212; from a known pedophile, attempts to turn decades of child sexual abuse rulings and statutes on their head.&#8221; &#160;&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-entertainment-celebrity-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Jackson estate's lawyers, Howard Weitzman and Jonathan Steinsapir, said in a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday they were "pleased that the Court dismissed the case against Mr. Safechuck by ruling that he had no grounds to pursue his lawsuit."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Meanwhile,&#160;<a href="https://deadline.com/2020/10/leaving-neverland-director-dan-reed-shooting-follow-up-film-1234599714/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Deadline</a> reports "Neverland" director&#160;Dan Reed&#160;is embroiled in a legal wrangle with Jackson&#8217;s companies as he attempts to shoot a sequel.&#160;Reed has been filming in the Los Angeles Superior Court as Robson and Safechuck navigate their lawsuits.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt='"Leaving Neverland" (HBO) with Wade Robson, director Dan Reed and James Safechuck'><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But on Wednesday,&#160;Weitzman and Steinsapir told USA TODAY in a statement that "there is no lawsuit around him.

<div><p>A Memphis poll worker was fired after turning away early voters who had been wearing &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; and &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Breathe&#8221; shirts.</p>
<p>Tennessee law prohibits voters wearing apparel with the name of a candidate or political party. Clothes with statements on them, however, are permitted.</p>
<p>Shelby County Election Commission spokeswoman Suzanne Thompson said the poll worker thought the anti-police brutality statements were tied to the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was pretty bad,&#8221; said Thompson. &#8220;They were not supposed to be turned away.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was unclear how many voters were told to leave.</p>
<p>Voters are showing up in droves ahead of Election Day in the Volunteer State, with turnout up 52 percent from 2016 and 87 percent from 2012.</p>
<p>Early voting in New York begins on Saturday. Any instances of intimidation, threats or coercion should be reported to poll workers or the state board of elections. Violators can face fines and imprisonment.</p>

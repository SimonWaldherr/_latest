He was also paid &#163;23,000 a month for a regular newspaper column.</p> <p>One MP said: &#8220;Boris has at least six children, some young enough to need financial help.</p>

 <p>     </p> <p>&#8220;And he had to pay ex-wife Marina Wheeler a shedload as part of their divorce deal.&#8221;</p> <p>Mr Johnson also has his six-month-old son Wilfred&#8217;s future education to consider. Sending him to his old school Eton will cost &#163;42,500 a year.</p> <p>Of other ex-Premiers, David Cameron commands &#163;120,000 for a speech and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> is worth an estimated &#163;22million from lectures and consultancy.</p> <p>MPs say while Mr Johnson yearned to be PM he is not so keen on actually doing the job.</p> <p>One added: &#8220;Boris is the typical adulterer. More interested in the chase than the prize.&#8221;</p> <p>There is now fevered behind-the-scenes activity as PM hopefuls jockey for position.</p> <p>Five contenders await: Chancellor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rishi-sunak">Rishi Sunak</a>, Foreign Secretary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dominic-raab-mp">Dominic Raab</a>, Cab- <br>inet Office chief <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-gove">Michael Gove</a>, ex-Health Secretary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-hunt">Jeremy Hunt</a> and former Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt.</p> <p>The bookies&#8217; favourite is Mr Sunak, as he has given away &#163;300billion in Covid cash.</p> <p>Mr Gove will have the support of Mr Johnson&#8217;s chief aide <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dominic-cummings">Dominic Cummings</a>, who advised him when he was Educa- <br>tion Secretary.</p> <p>But a senior Tory said: &#8220;That might well go against Michael. The last thing we want is for Cummings to stay in No10.&#8221;</p> <p>As First Secretary and Cabinet No2 Mr Raab has the benefit of having done Mr Johnson&#8217;s job when the PM was off sick with Covid-19 this year.</p> <p>But Mr Hunt has not given up hope, despite being trounced in last year&#8217;s leadership contest, and can be seen seeking support among MPs in the Commons.</p></div>

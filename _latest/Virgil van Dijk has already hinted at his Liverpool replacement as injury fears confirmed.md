 <p>     </p> <p>&#8220;Outstanding,&#8221; Van Dijk said of Fabinho's display against Chelsea.</p> <p>&#8220;I just told him as well I think he was Man of the Match. To keep out a striker like [Timo] Werner and don&#8217;t let him score, overall he was outstanding.</p> <p>&#8220;Everyone knows how good he is but it shows also that we need everyone. We are a bit unlucky with the injuries now but we&#8217;ll need everyone back because it&#8217;s such a long season.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fabinho previously stepped in for Van Dijk when he was suspended for a Champions League clash with Bayern Munich last February.</p> <p>After a 0-0 draw, Klopp highlighted how they were able to cope without Van Dijk with Fabinho in his place.</p> <p>Asked how important the return of Van Dijk was after suspension last February, Klopp said: When asked how important it was to have Van Dijk back, Klopp said: "Very. Like he always is.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>"But the most important thing is that we didn't miss him as much as a lot of people expected us to because we defend as a unit.</p> <p>"Of course it is really good to have him back. It is the first time in weeks that we have to make a choice between midfielders, full-backs and even centre-backs if you think about Fabinho.</p> <p>"It is great to have him [Fabinho] as an option for both positions. His natural position is in midfield but because he can play at centre-half it makes him an unbelievably valuable player for us."</p></div>

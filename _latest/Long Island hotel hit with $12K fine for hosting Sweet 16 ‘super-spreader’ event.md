A posh Long Island hotel was hit with $12,000 in fines for hosting a Sweet 16 party that became a coronavirus “super-spreader” event — infecting dozens of people, officials said.

At least 37 people linked to the Sept. 25 bash at The Miller Place Inn — which bills itself as “intimate and elegant” — have contracted COVID-19, according to Newsday.

“We have not seen an event like this before at any time throughout this pandemic,” Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said Tuesday. “For Suffolk County, this was a super-spreader event.”

A total of 81 guests attended the ill-fated birthday celebration — in violation of the state’s 50-person maximum, officials said. Some were not wearing masks.

Of the party-goers who tested positive, 28 were young people, including high school students in the area, and nine were adults.

Every person on the guest list was quarantined after the first positive case was reported on Sept. 30, and investigators later found at least 334 people who were in contact with party-goers. At least 183 of them attended or worked at local schools.

“As a result of this one event, 270 people were placed under quarantine, eight schools had positive cases and 35 schools had individuals placed under quarantine,” Bellone said.

The venue — which is also a popular spot for weddings, a few blocks from the Long Island Sound — was fined $10,000 for violations of New York public health law, officials said. Owners were also hit with a $2,000 penalty for county sanitary code violations.

Co-owner Christopher Regina said a lawyer for the inn is looking into whether it is in fact the location for the outbreak.

“We do not know if the infection was proved to be caused at our facility,” he told Newsday. “My attorney will advise us what the next step is.”

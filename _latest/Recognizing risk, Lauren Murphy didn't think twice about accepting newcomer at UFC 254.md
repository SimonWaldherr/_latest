<div><p>ABU DHABI &#8211; <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/tag/lauren-murphy">Lauren Murphy</a> was supposed to fight a top contender at UFC 254 but will take on a promotional newcomer instead.</p>
<p>After Cynthia Calvillo withdrew from their fight, the UFC signed promotional debutant Liliya Shakirova as a replacement. Despite the high-risk, low-reward nature of the matchup, Murphy (13-4 MMA, 6-4 UFC) didn&#8217;t think twice about accepting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge risk,&#8221; Murphy told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at a pre-fight news conference Tuesday. &#8220;I&#8217;m at the top right now. This fight with Cynthia was a big fight. It was going to maybe mean a lot of things. To step in and fight somebody that&#8217;s brand new that we know nothing about, yeah, it&#8217;s a huge risk. But it was a risk I was willing to take to come out and have the &#8216;Fight Island&#8217; experience and hopefully cement my place in the division. So it never occurred to me, &#8216;Let&#8217;s not do this.&#8217; I told Mick, &#8216;Put me on the plane. I&#8217;ll fight whoever.&#8217; It&#8217;s going to work out, for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite losing her highly ranked opponent, Murphy thinks there could still be opportunities to be earned with a win over Shakirova (8-1 MMA, 0-0 UFC). A victory would signal four in a row for Murphy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just have to see how the fight goes. It really depends on how the fight goes, really,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s kind of the case with any fight. You&#8217;ve got to see what happens in the first one before you move on to the next one. There&#8217;s a lot happening in the division right now. It&#8217;s a pretty exciting time to be in 125.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; As long as I give an impressive performance, then I&#8217;m in a good spot. You know what I mean? Really, from this point, it&#8217;s just about giving the best performance that I can. Maybe Cynthia and I will see each other down the road. Who knows?&#8221;</p>
<p>UFC 254 takes place Saturday at Flash Forum on Yas Island, Abu Dhabi. The main card streams on pay-per-view after prelims on ESPN 2/ESPN+.</p>

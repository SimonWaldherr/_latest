<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">It would have been a tough hit on the Democratic presidential nominee &#8212; except the property in the photograph is <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-mansion-tweet/" target="_blank">not Biden&#8217;s</a>. It hasn&#8217;t been for 24 years. He had bought it, dilapidated, in the mid-1970s for $185,000, then, after rehabilitating it over two decades, <a href="https://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2008/09/does-senator-joe-biden-have-house_10.html#.X431c9BKiUl" target="_blank">sold </a>it for $1.2 million.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">The only scandal the episode revealed was how desperate President Trump and his allies are to find something &#8212; anything &#8212; that might change the trajectory of the race at this late stage. After 2016, only a fool would confidently predict the election outcome. But judging from the actions of Trump&#8217;s team and Republican lawmakers and candidates, it&#8217;s clear <i>they</i> think they&#8217;re losing.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">They&#8217;re attacking Democrats for having hard-to-pronounce names and for allegedly being closet vegans. They&#8217;re dropping supposed bombshells about Biden&#8217;s past that fail to detonate. And they&#8217;re pretending they never liked that Trump guy.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Item: Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a stalwart Trump ally now in a close race, <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/article246503045.html" target="_blank">told </a>the Fort Worth Star-Telegram his relationship with Trump is &#8220;like a lot of women who get married and think they&#8217;re going to change their spouse, and that doesn&#8217;t usually work out very well.&#8221; Cornyn, who <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2020/10/18/cornyn-defended-trump-for-siphoning-pentagon-budget-to-pay-for-border-wall-but-now-claims-he-was-against-it/" target="_blank">publicly supported Trump diverting Pentagon funds</a> for a border wall, now claims he opposed it.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Item: Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), another Trump enabler for four years, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sasse-senate-trump-republicans/2020/10/15/644ece10-0f18-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_11" target="_blank">excoriated </a>Trump last week because he &#8220;kisses dictators&#8217; butts,&#8221; &#8220;mocks evangelicals&#8221; and &#8220;flirted with white supremacists&#8221; &#8212; sentiments Sasse largely suppressed before he feared &#8220;a Republican bloodbath in the Senate.&#8221;</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Item: The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/us/politics/trump-2020-campaign.html" target="_blank">reports </a>that &#8220;midlevel aides on the campaign have even begun inquiring about employment on Capitol Hill after the election, apparently under the assumption that there will not be a second Trump administration for them to serve in.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">If Republicans think abandoning ship now will work for them, I&#8217;ve got a house in Delaware to sell them. Even as Republicans belatedly decide the USS Trump is going down, they are mirroring his aimless campaign themes in their own races.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In Pennsylvania, where Democrat Eugene DePasquale is poised to oust Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), the National Republican Congressional Committee <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gGZnDBYY1E&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=NRCCIE%20%5Byoutube.com%5D" target="_blank">put up an ad</a> on Oct. 13 attacking DePasquale &#8212; for his Italian name. &#8220;Eugene DePasquale: Tough to spell,&#8221; the announcer intones. The ad also mocks DePasquale&#8217;s <a href="https://www.politicspa.com/pa10-depasquale-does-crossfit-in-new-ad/95555/" target="_blank">CrossFit routine</a> with scenes of gym equipment and push-ups.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In Nebraska, where Democrat Kara Eastman is positioned to defeat a Republican incumbent, an ad by the Congressional Leadership Fund &#8212; the House GOP super PAC &#8212; shows the Democrat&#8217;s head superimposed over a raw steak. It accuses her of plotting to &#8220;get rid of farting cows,&#8221; warns she&#8217;ll &#8220;stick a fork in that Omaha steak&#8221; and closes with the announcer asking: &#8220;How do you like your tofu?&#8221; Fittingly, her opponent&#8217;s name is Rep. Don Bacon.</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Eastman, in a meeting with supporters, had said Republicans are &#8220;attacking me like crazy. There&#8217;s fliers going out to everybody in the district that I&#8217;m a radical socialist.&#8221; The CLF <a href="https://twitter.com/karaforcongress/status/1311710691112497156" target="_blank">cut out all the words</a> except &#8220;I&#8217;m a radical socialist&#8221; and uses that phrase in the ad. Another CLF ad says Eastman wants a &#8220;new world where no one eats meat.&#8221; And an NRCC ad says she wants to abolish cars and air travel and raise taxes to 70 percent.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">In Texas, where Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni has a good shot to flip a Republican seat, the CLF <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvlfjSNX1sU&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">attacks him</a> for attending &#8220;notorious desert drug parties.&#8221; The &#8220;drug party&#8221; in question? The annual Burning Man arts festival, attended by tens of thousands.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">One Republican congressional nominee in Virginia <a href="https://twitter.com/jaaavis/status/1306947058067288064?s=21" target="_blank">slams </a>his son to a wrestling mat and repeatedly pins him to show he&#8217;ll &#8220;put liberal ideas in a headlock.&#8221; At one Trump rally, embattled Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) makes fun of the name of his colleague, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris. At another, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) says Biden supporters don&#8217;t &#8220;particularly like America.&#8221;</p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">If it all seems scattered and random (They&#8217;re corrupt capitalists! No, they&#8217;re socialists! No, they&#8217;re anarchists!), consider the direction from the top. Last week, Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani served up his latest Hunter Biden conspiracy theory to Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s New York Post. The evidence was so <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-truth-behind-the-hunter-biden-non-scandal/2020/10/16/798210bc-0fd1-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_26" target="_blank">shoddy </a>the main author reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/business/media/new-york-post-hunter-biden.html" target="_blank">refused to put his name on it</a>.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">Giuliani must have hoped for an October Surprise. But the real surprise is this: After Trump ransacked the CIA, the Justice Department and the State Department for any morsel of dirt on his opponent, the election is upon us &#8212; and this is all he&#8217;s got?</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><i><b>Sign up to </b></i><a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/danamilbank?method=SURL&amp;location=ART&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_28"><i><b>receive my columns in your inbox as soon as they&#8217;re published</b></i></a><i><b>.</b></i></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><b>Read more:</b></p></div>

<div><p>With coronavirus concerns a factor, it's all tied up in North Carolina: Poll It's a dead heat in both the presidential and Senate races in our latest data.</p><p id="_ap_link_Donald Trump_DonaldTrump_">Coronavirus concerns lift former Vice President Joe Biden in North Carolina while the state&#8217;s sizable evangelical and rural populations pull for President <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump" id="_ap_link_Donald Trump_DonaldTrump_" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, producing a dead-heat contest in a state that&#8217;s backed Democratic presidential candidates just twice in the last half century.</p><p>Biden has 49% support among likely voters in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll in the state, with 48% for Trump. The U.S. Senate race, potentially critical for control of the chamber, is similar, with 49% support for Democrat Cal Cunningham, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-candidate-admits-exchanging-sexual-text-messages-strategist/story?id=73404502">despite revelations of an extramarital relationship</a>, and 47% for incumbent Republican Thom Tillis.</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads incontentTeads--story ad-slot"></p><p><img src="https://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/Embed_Chart_2020VotePreference_PresidentandSenate_v03_AG_1603137319851_hpEmbed_1x1_608.jpg"></p><p><a href="https://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1216a42020StateBattlegrounds-NC.pdf">See PDF for full results, charts and tables.</a></p><p>The presidential race differs from the contest nationally -- an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/powered-trust-pandemic-biden-leads-12-points-nationwide/story?id=73528233">ABC/Post poll last week</a> found a 12-point Biden lead -- in large part given differing demographics. Most notably, evangelical white Protestants account for 31% of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/thousands-north-carolina-ballots-limbo-amid-challenges-rule/story?id=73432943">likely voters in North Carolina</a>, compared with 15% nationally. White evangelicals in the state support Trump over Biden by 82-17%.</p><p><img src="https://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/Embed_Chart_2020VotePreference_SelectDemographicGroups_v02_AG_1603137319853_hpEmbed_1x1_608.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/close-contest-wisconsin-minnesota-poll/story?id=72998751">Rural voters</a> also are part of the difference in this survey, produced for ABC by <a href="https://www.langerresearch.com">Langer Research Associates</a>; they account for 21% of likely voters nationally but 28% in the state, and back Trump by nearly 2-1, 63-33%. So, too, are very conservative likely voters -- 16% nationally but 24% in North Carolina, nearly all for Trump.</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: President Donald Trump dances as he walks off stage during a campaign rally at Pitt-Greenville Airport, Oct. 15, 2020, in Greenville, N.C." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>Biden pushes back with a 34-point lead among moderate voters, 64-30%, surpassing Hillary Clinton&#8217;s 20-point win in this group in 2016; a 68-30% lead in the state&#8217;s political, academic and technology hub, the Raleigh-Durham area; and 60-38% among college graduates -- the widest Democratic advantage in this group in exit polls since 1988.</p><p class="Ad incontentTeads2 incontentTeads2--story ad-slot"></p><h2>Voting and the virus</h2><p>Early voting is commonplace in North Carolina; 66% of likely voters say they&#8217;ll vote early or already have done so, about the same as in 2016. Far fewer, 28%, plan to vote on Election Day (and 6% are undecided when to vote). In a pattern seen nationally and in other states, Biden leads by 60-37% among those who plan to vote early, compared with a wide Trump lead, 72-24%, among Election Day likely voters.</p><p id="_ap_link_coronavirus_Coronavirus_"><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/election-2020-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-unlike-year/story?id=73592283">Voting intentions</a> are associated with <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/health/coronavirus" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> concerns. With the state having reported its <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-battleground-states-reporting-record-high-coronavirus-cases/story?id=73667226">highest single-day increase in COVID-19 cases</a> last week, 61% of likely voters are very or somewhat worried that they or an immediate family member may catch the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/coronavirus" id="_ap_link_coronavirus_Coronavirus_" target="_blank">coronavirus</a>. Those who are worried are 22 points more apt than others to plan to vote early or to have already voted.</p><p>Likely voters divide 51-45%, Biden-Trump, in trust to handle the pandemic (not a statistically significant difference); similarly, 51% <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-virus-precautions-poll/story?id=73411221">disapprove of how Trump is handling it</a>. More tellingly, among those who are more worried about catching the coronavirus, 68% support Biden. Among those less worried or unworried, 80% favor Trump.</p><p>Again reflecting national results, economic attitudes are better for Trump. Fifty-four percent of likely voters approve of how he&#8217;s <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economy-coronavirus-pandemic-biden-advantage-nationally-poll/story?id=73252425">handling the economy</a> and 52% prefer him rather than Biden to manage it. Among those who approve of Trump&#8217;s economic performance, 86% back him.</p><p><img src="https://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/Embed_Chart_2020VotePreference_Table01_v06_AG_1603137319855_hpEmbed_47x16_608.jpg"></p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden arrives to speak at a drive-in campaign rally at Riverside High School in Durham, N.C., Oct. 18, 2020." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>Also better for Trump, as elsewhere, is that 76% of his supporters are very enthusiastic about supporting him, while <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/PollingUnit/election-advantage-stays-biden-enthusiasm-deficit-eases-remains/story?id=72356854">strong enthusiasm for Biden</a> falls to 61%. That said, Trump&#8217;s overall job approval rating is weak, 47-50%, approve-disapprove.</p><h2>Regions and Groups</h2><p>Biden&#8217;s 68% support in Raleigh-Durham is somewhat higher than typical for that region -- Clinton won 60% there -- and looks critical to his chances.</p><p>Elsewhere, the contest, regionally, looks like a rerun of 2016. It&#8217;s a close 50-47%, Biden-Trump, in Charlotte, and flips to an also-close 51-46%, Trump-Biden, in eastern North Carolina. It&#8217;s close again, 51-44%, Trump-Biden, in the central Piedmont region, and a wide 63-35% Trump advantage in the conservative west.</p><p><img src="https://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/Embed_Chart_2020VotePreference_Table02_v02_AG_1603137319856_hpEmbed_29x13_608.jpg"></p><p id="_ap_link_election_Elections_">Trump won North Carolina by 50-46% four years ago. The state has gone Republican in every presidential <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/elections" id="_ap_link_election_Elections_" target="_blank">election</a> since 1968, save two: Barack Obama won here in 2008 by about 14,000 votes out of 4.3 million cast, as did Jimmy Carter, more comfortably, in 1976.</p><p>Among groups, some shifts from 2016 are striking. Independents backed Trump over Clinton by 53-37% in 2016, per the ABC News exit poll; they now split, 47-46%, Biden-Trump. College graduates in 2016 divided 49-48%, Clinton-Trump; today, as noted, they go 60-38%, Biden-Trump. That said, 65% of likely voters don&#8217;t have a college degree. Among them, non-college whites are critical for Trump -- a 38-point lead, 67-29%.</p><p>As nationally, there&#8217;s a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pennsylvania-advantage-biden-big-boost-women-poll/story?id=73290218">gender gap</a>; it&#8217;s a 54-43% Biden-Trump race among women while 53-43% Trump-Biden among men. (These are slight differences given sample sizes.) That includes a 30-point Trump lead among white men, shrinking to a non-significant 10 percentage points among white women. Biden has 84% support from blacks, a fifth of the electorate, and 76% from racial and ethnic minorities overall, who account for nearly three in 10 likely voters.</p><h2>Senate</h2><p>In the Senate race, Cunningham&#8217;s helped by the number of likely voters willing to set aside his marital infidelity: Twenty-seven percent call this extremely or very important in their vote. Many more, 59%, call Tillis&#8217; support for Trump highly important, and more still, 85%, ascribe high importance to which party wins control of the Senate. (Cunningham has confirmed sending romantic text messages to a woman who&#8217;s not his wife. That woman has said they had at least one intimate encounter, which Cunningham has neither confirmed nor denied.)</p><p class="ScrollSpy_container"><p></p></p><p class="RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto"></p><img class="" alt="PHOTO: In this Oct. 1, 2020, file photo, Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham talks during during a televised debate with Sen. Thom Tillis, in Raleigh, N.C." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><p class="Caption__Wrapper"></p><p>Among those who call Cunningham&#8217;s infidelity highly important, 80% back Tillis, while the Republican&#8217;s support dives to 33% among likely voters who call this less important or unimportant. There are far closer divisions among those who focused on Tillis&#8217; support for Trump (52-46%, Tillis-Cunningham) and on control of the Senate (48-48%).</p><p>Scandal aside, the race is highly reflective of the presidential contest in the state. Cunningham leads among Democrats (93%), liberals (92%), racial and ethnic minorities (73%), those concerned about catching the coronavirus (65%), city residents (64%), moderates (61%) and women (55%). Tillis is boosted by support among Republicans (92%), conservatives (85%), evangelical white Protestants (82%), those in rural areas (62%), white people (58%) and men (55%). The race is essentially tied among independents and suburban voters.</p><p>Indeed, Cunningham is supported by 92% of those who back Biden, with 5% going to Tillis. Among Trump supporters, these numbers are precisely reversed.</p><p>As in the presidential contest, the Senate race is virtually tied in three of the state&#8217;s five geopolitical regions &#8211; 49-48% in the central Piedmont region, 49-45% in the eastern part of the state and 48-45% in Charlotte, all Tillis-Cunningham. Those compare with a Tillis lead in the western counties, 58-38%, countered by a wide 65-32% advantage for Cunningham in the Raleigh-Durham area. (Tillis lives outside of Charlotte. Cunningham grew up in Lexington, in the Piedmont region, and now lives in Raleigh.)</p><p>Lastly, Cunningham, a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, runs essentially even with Tillis in households that include a veteran or active-duty member of the military, 48-47%, Tillis-Cunningham. (This accounts for nearly half of likely voters in the state.) It&#8217;s also close, 50-45%, Cunningham-Tillis, in households without a veteran or current service member. This, too, is similar to the race for president: 50-47%, Trump-Biden, in veteran or current military households, and 51-46%, Biden-Trump, in others.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone interviews Oct. 12-17, 2020 among a random sample of 706 North Carolina registered voters and 646 likely voters. Results have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/PollingUnit/sampling-error-means/story?id=5984818">margins of sampling error</a> of 4.5 points among both groups. Partisan divisions &#8211; Democrats-Republicans-independents &#8211; are 33-32-30% among registered voters and 34-33-29% among likely voters.</p><p>The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Abt Associates of Rockville, Md.

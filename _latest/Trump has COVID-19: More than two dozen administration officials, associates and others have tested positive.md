WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump was discharged from Walter Reed National Medical Center Monday, four days after he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19.

Trump's announcement early Friday morning sent Washington and the rest of the country into fresh turmoil a month before the election. At least 20 people, including top administration officials, have tested positive since then. Many attended Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination ceremony Sept. 26 at the White House Rose Garden, where few people wore masks.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who debated Trump Oct. 2, has tested negative. But because the virus' incubation period can be up to 14 days, a negative test earlier in that time frame does not mean a person was not infected.

Here's a running list of people who have tested positive and negative. This is a developing story, not a comprehensive list, which we will keep updated in the days to come.

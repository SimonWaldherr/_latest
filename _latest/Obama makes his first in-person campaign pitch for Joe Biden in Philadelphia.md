<div><p>Former President Obama hit the campaign trail for the first time in person Wednesday in Philadelphia to stump for his former vice president, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and Biden&#8217;s running mate California Sen. Kamala Harris.</p><p>In his first appearance, at a round-table event with Black local elected officials and community leaders, Obama, wearing a mask, urged the importance of Black voters forming coalitions with other voters to win elections. He especially urged the importance of getting younger Black men, who turn out less frequently, to the polls.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just that they&#8217;re African American males, they&#8217;re young, and young people have a lot of distractions,&#8221; said Obama, whose first victory in 2008 was boosted by record turnout among Black voters. &#8220;The most important thing we can do in these closing 12, 13 days, for us all, [is] to model and advertise that it&#8217;s the cool thing and the right thing to do to vote.&#8221;</p><p>To young people, Obama said, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to work if you don&#8217;t try it,&#8221; adding, &#8220;give this a shot.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Obama&#8217;s visit to Pennsylvania highlights the importance of the state that both Biden and President Trump have prioritized. Philadelphia is a Democratic stronghold that Biden will need to carry the divided battleground state. Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008 and 2012, but Trump carried the state in 2016 over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, by just 44,000 votes.</p><p>One of the biggest tricks that&#8217;s perpetrated on the American people is this idea that the government is separate from you,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;The government&#8217;s us. Of, by and for the people. It wasn&#8217;t always for all of us, but the way it&#8217;s designed, it works based on who&#8217;s at the table. And if you do not vote, you are not at the table, then yes, stuff is done to you. If you&#8217;re at the table, then you&#8217;re part of the solution.&#8221;</p>

<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>&#8220;The pandemic would have been tough for any president. We have&#8217;t seen something like this for a hundred years,&#8221; Obama said, lambasting &#8220;incompetence and misinformation&#8221; and &#8220;the number of people who might not have died had we just done the basics.&#8221;</p><p>The former president is also appearing at a &#8220;drive-in rally&#8221; that started about 3 p.m. Pacific time outside the South Philadelphia stadium that&#8217;s home to the Phillies baseball franchise. The event &#8212; in a crucial state in the presidential contest &#8212; is expected to be livestreamed. </p><p>Obama had largely stayed away from publicly criticizing Trump for much of Trump&#8217;s presidency. But the former president has taken an increasingly public role in support of Biden, including giving <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-20/president-obama-speech-dnc-2020" target="_blank">a speech at the Democratic National Convention</a> in which he said &#8220;Donald Trump hasn&#8217;t grown into the job because he can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>Philadelphia is a Democratic stronghold that Biden will need to carry Pennsylvania, a divided battleground state whose 20 electoral votes could be key to Biden and Trump&#8217;s path to the 270 needed to win.</p><p>Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008 and 2012, but Trump carried the state in 2016 over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, by just 44,000 votes.</p><p></p></div>

<div><p>So why has news of his return in the Justice League &#8220;Snyder Cut&#8221; gone down like a whoopee cushion at the reading of a will? Suicide Squad being an unwatchable muddle, as already pointed out, hasn&#8217;t helped. But the real black mark against Leto&#8217;s Joker is probably connected to the actor&#8217;s bizarre offscreen behaviour during the making of that film, not least his attempt to &#8220;method act&#8221; his way through the production by sending his co-stars a series of horrific gifts.&#160;</p>
<p>These were reported at the time to include used condoms, dead rats, dead pigs and&#160;pornographic magazines. &#8220;He did some bad things, Jared Leto did. He gave some really horrific gifts,&#8221; his co-star&#160;Viola Davis <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BqO6nvEQMc" rel="nofollow">confirmed to Vanity Fair</a>.</p>
<p>Davis was one of several cast members unamused by Leto&#8217;s behaviour. &#8220;He had a henchman who would come into the rehearsal room, and the henchman came in with a dead pig and plopped it on the table, and then he walked out. And that was our introduction to Jared Leto.&#8221;</p>
<p>The antics freaked out even Will Smith (Suicide Squad leader Deadshot). This was an unlikely turn of events. Having tussled with a steampunk Kenneth Branagh in Wild Wild West, Smith should have been well beyond feeling shocked on a movie set.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;First we found out that Jared wasn't going to be in rehearsals,&#8221; Smith <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/video/2867927/suicide-squad-jared-leto-joker/" rel="nofollow">told MTV</a>.&#160;&#8220;And we were like, &#8216;That's messed up! How is he not going to be in rehearsals?&#8217; And then there was a bag on the door, and this dude barges in and throws a dead pig on the floor in front of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suicide Squad director David&#160;Ayer didn&#8217;t see the amusing side. This may account for the gutting of&#160;Leto&#8217;s screen time. That 10-minute total left cinemagoers&#160;nonplussed &#8211; the film&#8217;s&#160;marketing campaign&#160;had portrayed Leto as the major villain. The real baddie, in the event, was Enchantress, played by Cara Delevingne as a sort of apocalyptic belly dancer.</p>

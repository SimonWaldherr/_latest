  Lakers Rumors: LA Requests Luol Deng's Contract Come off Books Due to Injury 
description: > 
  Ron Jenkins/Associated PressThe Los Angeles Lakers have asked the NBA to remove Luol Deng's remaining salary from their future accounting because of what they label a career-ending injury for the veteran swingman, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium.Los Angeles used the stretch provision, so he counts for $5 million annually in dead money through the 2021-22 season.An Achilles injury curtailed his Timberwolves tenure, but the fact he suited up for the team at all would seemingly undercut Los Angeles' position.The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on the NBA's finances, and even marquee franchises such as the Lakers aren't immune.More importantly, the Lakers could be heading into the 2021 offseason with both Davis and James eligible for free agency.

Coronavirus infections are now spreading to the elderly and moving south across the country, experts have revealed.

During a briefing at No 10, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said it was of "concern" that coronavirus was "heating up" in more of England than a week ago.

Prof Van-Tam said: “This is a nationwide phenomenon now that rates are changing upwards across the UK."

He also warned that the virus was now spreading from younger age groups into those aged over 60.

"And this is again of significant concern... because of course the elderly suffer a much worse course with Covid-19, they are admitted to hospital for longer periods, and they are more difficult to save,” he said.

Professor Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said there were now more patients in hospital with coronavirus than there were when the Government ordered the lockdown in March.

As a result, the temporary Nightingale hospitals in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate have been mobilised to accept patients “if necessary”, he added.

There will also be an increase in testing of asymptomatic health staff in hotspot areas, he confirmed.

At 3.30pm, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to address the House of Commons, and at 6pm he will address the nation.

Mr Johnson will spell out his three-tier strategy with areas in England labelled as medium, high or very high risk, which will inform the "appropriate interventions" needed in each area.

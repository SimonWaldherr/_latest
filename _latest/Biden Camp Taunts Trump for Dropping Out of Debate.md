The Biden campaign went straight for President Donald Trump's ego Thursday, casting the president as frightened and weak – not because Trump has the coronavirus but because he is refusing to participate in a virtual debate.

"Joe Biden was prepared to accept the (Commission on Presidential Debates)'s proposal for a virtual Town Hall, but the President has refused, as Donald Trump clearly does not want to face questions from the voters about his failures on COVID and the economy," Kate Bedingfield, Biden's spokeswoman and deputy campaign manager, said in a statement Thursday.

"As a result, Joe Biden will find an appropriate place to take questions from voters directly on October 15th, as he has done on several occasions in recent weeks. Given the President's refusal to participate on October 15th, we hope the Debate Commission will move the Biden-Trump Town Hall to October 22nd, so that the President is not able to evade accountability."

The strategy appeared to have worked, as the Trump campaign soon afterward issued a statement saying the president would be OK with having the final two debates Oct. 22 and 29th, when the ailing president would presumably be healthier.

"The American people should not be deprived of the chance to see the two candidates for president debate face to face two more times just because the Commission on Presidential Debates wants to protect Joe Biden," a statement from the campaign said, calling it "extremely suspect" that the nonpartisan commission moved to alter the debate format the morning after the vice presidential debate.

Vice President Mike Pence "wiped the floor" with Democratic nominee Sen. Kamala Harris, said the statement by Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien. A CNN poll taken right after the debate found that 59% thought Harris had won the debate, compared to 31% who thought Pence prevailed. Such polls are not considered consequential, since they tend to reflect the views voters already have of the candidates.

But the Biden campaign wouldn't bite, issuing yet another statement saying Trump doesn't get to set the debate schedule, and the vice president would not agree to another debate just days before Election Day on Nov. 3.

"We accepted the three dates – Sept. 29, Oct. 15, and Oct. 22 – in June. Trump chose today to pull out of the October 15th debate," Bedingfield said in the latest not-so-merry-go-round of the fate of the debates.

"Trump's erratic behavior does not allow him to rewrite the calendar, and pick new dates of his choosing. We look forward to participating in the final debate, scheduled for October 22, which already is tied for the latest debate date in 40 years. Donald Trump can show up, or he can decline again. That's his choice," she said.

Under the latest offer from the Biden campaign, the two men would meet just once more, on the scheduled date of Oct. 22, but with a town hall format. Biden tends to do better in a town hall format, where he can connect and empathize with voters. A town hall would also force Trump to answer directly to voters instead of taking on Biden – or the moderator – directly.

The back-and-forth between the campaigns started after Trump told Fox Business Network he would not participate in the virtual town hall debate the commission had rearranged that very morning. Such a format, which the commission said was done to protect the health and safety of both candidates and everyone else present at the event, would be "a waste of my time," an irritated Trump told the network in phone interviews.

"You sit behind a computer and do a debate – it's ridiculous, and then they cut you off whenever they want," complained Trump, who was widely criticized for interrupting Biden repeatedly during the first presidential debate in Cleveland last week.

Trump prizes his self-created image as a man of strength and near-invincibility, and the Biden statement took direct aim at that – along with Trump's ego. Even after contracting COVID-19, Trump has declared himself virtually cured and urged people not to fear the virus that has killed more than 212,000 Americans.

"The voters should have a chance to ask questions of both candidates, directly. Every Presidential candidate since 1992 has participated in such an event, and it would be a shame if Donald Trump was the first to refuse," Bedingfield said in her statement, virtually taunting Trump to do the event as re-planned.

Both campaigns had already agreed to the Oct. 15 debate, but not to the updated format. The vice presidential debate Wednesday night was altered to have the contenders a safer 12 feet apart and separated as well by two panes of plexiglass.

Trump said he would do a rally instead – a bold move, considering that public health officials warn against large gatherings amid the pandemic. Trump said in the Fox interview that he thought he was not contagious, but none of his doctors has said the same.

Biden, leaving for a campaign trip for Arizona, where he was to campaign with running mate Sen. Kamala Harris for the first time since the Democratic National Convention, said he wasn't sure what Trump's game plan was.

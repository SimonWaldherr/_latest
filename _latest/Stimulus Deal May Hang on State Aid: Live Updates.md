The two sides have been trying to reach an agreement on another round of economic aid that could be enacted before Nov. 3. But Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has told the White House to abandon its efforts, concerned about the political fallout for Republicans.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Mr. Meadows suggested that progress was being made, but said he feared that politics could get in the way. Ms. Pelosi on Tuesday signaled that Democrats were preparing counteroffers on both liability protections for businesses that are seeking to reopen and state and local funding.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The White House has proposed providing $250 billion to states and municipalities, Mr. Meadows said, while House Democrats have called for double that. He also said that the liability protections were a crucial priority for Republicans, and he chided Ms. Pelosi for resisting them, saying she was being &#8220;disingenuous&#8221; if she believed that his party would agree to any deal without them.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Even as Republicans resisted a compromise, pressure was mounting from rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties to reach one. A bipartisan group of House lawmakers on Wednesday wrote to congressional leaders and Mr. Trump urging a resolution before the November elections.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We know there may be remaining issues to be resolved between the negotiators, but it appears those issues are certainly solvable,&#8221; the group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, wrote. &#8220;Our families, businesses, and local communities don&#8217;t have the luxury of time so Washington can continue its partisan games. We must do our job and do it now.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Across the Capitol, Senate Democrats blocked a move by Republicans to advance a $500 billion plan that would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits and a popular federal loan program for small businesses, as well as provide additional money for testing. Democrats, who have argued the package falls far short of the level of aid needed, unanimously opposed it, and it fell short on a party-line vote of 51-44, failing to clear the 60-vote threshold required to move forward.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-rappeport" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="the-easiest-part-of-the-labor-markets-recovery-is-likely-behind-us-a-fed-governor-says"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#the-easiest-part-of-the-labor-markets-recovery-is-likely-behind-us-a-fed-governor-says">The easiest part of the labor market&#8217;s recovery is likely behind us, a Fed governor says.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Lael Brainard, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/business/21markets-brainard/merlin_146140461_da6ed885-4690-437c-b862-97fed2f08d6a-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Lael Brainard, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who is seen as a possible future Treasury secretary if former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wins the election, warned in a speech Wednesday that &#8220;the easiest<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>improvements&#8221; in the labor market &#8220;are likely behind us.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Ms. Brainard pointed out that the share of permanent layoffs is rising &#8212; bad news because it takes longer to rehire those workers than people who have temporarily lost their jobs &#8212; and that unemployment insurance claims have ticked up. She also noted that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/02/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/women-dropped-out-of-the-labor-market-as-child-care-loomed-large" title="">participation rates for women</a> in their prime working years have fallen.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">That decline &#8220;could have longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth,&#8221; she said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A shortfall in government support could pose a major risk to the pace of the economic rebound, Ms. Brainard said, especially if additional help comes after hard-hit households burn through the savings they built up earlier in the crisis.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">&#8220;</strong>Apart from the course of the virus itself, the most significant downside risk to my outlook would be the failure of additional fiscal support to materialize,&#8221; she said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Economists often refer to the economic rebound underway as K-shaped, meaning that it is sharply divided. Some people have held onto their jobs, watched their savings rise and maintained basically normal consumption patterns despite some pandemic-spurred modifications. But another broad segment of workers has lost jobs and seen its labor income dry up. While many such households <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/upshot/stimulus-checks-unemployment.html" title="">are now living off</a> savings from earlier government support, those funds will not last forever. Likewise, many big businesses are doing well, even as smaller companies and those in hard-hit sectors struggle.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Further targeted fiscal support will be needed alongside accommodative monetary policy to turn this K-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery,&#8221; Ms. Brainard said. &#8220;The most important message is simply that we will have a much better, stronger, more inclusive recovery if we do continue to see that targeted fiscal support&#8221; alongside Fed policy.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeanna-smialek" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid1-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid1"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="europe-sells-bonds-for-pandemic-relief-challenging-the-dominance-of-us-treasuries"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#europe-sells-bonds-for-pandemic-relief-challenging-the-dominance-of-us-treasuries">Europe sells bonds for pandemic relief, challenging the dominance of U.S. Treasuries.</a></h2><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">There&#8217;s a new gorilla in the bond market.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The European Union issued debt in a big way for the first time this week to finance pandemic relief programs, generating huge demand from investors eager for an alternative to the United States Treasuries that dominate the government bond market.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The bloc has issued debt before, for example to help Greece recover from a financial crisis, but never on the scale seen Tuesday. The European Commission sold 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in 10-year and 20-year bonds, the first of a series of issues that will raise a total of &#8364;900 million during the next five years.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Previously, national governments were responsible for almost all of their own financing. Countries like Germany and the Netherlands were against issuing common debt, but the pandemic changed their views.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;We have done it before, but we are entering a new level,&#8221; Johannes Hahn, the European commissioner in charge of budget and administration, told reporters at a news conference in Brussels Wednesday to announce the results of the sale.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Demand for the bonds, which had interest rates near zero, was 13 times the supply, a sign that investors have grown uneasy about having too much of their money in Treasuries, analysts said. Investors are worried about soaring government spending by the United States government, a widening trade deficit and falling interest rates, George Saravelos, a bond strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a research report.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The sale is &#8220;a vote of confidence on the euro as a reserve asset, particularly at a time when the dollar&#8217;s dominant role is being questioned,&#8221; Mr. Saravelos said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The money is earmarked for relief programs such as subsidized furloughs for workers in industries hard hit by the pandemic. But the funds will take a while to reach European citizens because of a political impasse in Brussels.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The European Parliament is demanding that money be withheld from Hungary and Poland because of their increasingly authoritarian governments and violations of European Union rules. European leaders like Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, are against withholding the money.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-ewing" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="purdue-pharma-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charges-for-opioid-sales"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#purdue-pharma-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charges-for-opioid-sales">Purdue Pharma pleads guilty to criminal charges for opioid sales.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Family and friends of people lost to opioid overdoses protested outside Purdue Pharma&#8217;s headquarters in Stamford, Conn., in 2018." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/science/21PURDUE/merlin_159958377_7cf1d221-a2a1-4f4a-8489-5243bf895054-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Family and friends of people lost to opioid overdoses protested outside Purdue Pharma&#8217;s headquarters in Stamford, Conn., in 2018.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Jessica Hill/Associated Press</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/health/purdue-opioids-criminal-charges.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges</a> of defrauding federal health agencies and violating <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-investigation-opioids-e/exclusive-oxycontin-maker-purdue-is-pharma-co-x-in-u-s-opioid-kickback-probe-sources-idUSKBN1ZR2RY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anti-kickback laws</a>, and faces penalties of roughly $8.3 billion, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The company&#8217;s owners, members of the wealthy Sackler family, will pay $225 million in civil penalties.</p><p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Wednesday&#8217;s announcement does not conclude the extensive litigation against Purdue, but it does represent a significant advance in the long legal march by states, cities and counties to compel the most prominent defendant in the opioid epidemic to help pay for the public health crisis that has resulted in the deaths of more than 450,000 Americans since 1999, according to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/analysis.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, it is unlikely the company will end up paying anything close to the $8 billion negotiated in the settlement deal.

In return, Google paid Apple a chunk of the ad revenue it collected from the millions of Google searches conducted on iPhones.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Today that arrangement covers all Apple devices, which now account for nearly half of all Google search traffic, according to the Justice Department&#8217;s lawsuit. As a result, Google pays Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion a year, according to the suit. That has made Apple and Google hugely reliant on one another, while edging out other search engines and, according to the U.S. government, protecting Google&#8217;s monopoly.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;By paying Apple a portion of the monopoly rents extracted from advertisers, Google has aligned Apple&#8217;s financial incentives with its own and set the price of bidding for distribution extraordinarily high &#8212; in the billions,&#8221; the Justice Department said in its lawsuit.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With billions of dollars on the line, the partnership is critical to both companies.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">With billions of dollars on the line, the partnership is critical to both companies.

Google is charged with monopolizing search by using restrictive and exclusive deals, like Microsoft&#8217;s bundling of software programs with its operating system. Google says that other companies, including Microsoft, control prime mobile and desktop space, so it negotiates for &#8220;eye-level shelf space&#8221; to place its products like a cereal brand would with supermarkets.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Will Google get broken up? </strong>&#8220;Nothing is off the table,&#8221; said the associate deputy attorney general Ryan Shores. A trial judge initially ordered a breakup in the Microsoft case, but the Justice Department eventually settled the case. The E.U. has generally eschewed breakups &#8212; it settled its antitrust case against Google for abusing its power in the mobile phone market with a fine and behavioral changes. Whatever the outcome, investors don&#8217;t seem worried: Shares in Google&#8217;s parent, Alphabet, rose yesterday, and are also up in premarket trading today.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Could Google just pay to make this go away? </strong>With more than $120 billion in cash and an army of lawyers, it has the power to drag this out for a long time if it wants to. Or it could dip into the funds to settle the case with a fine and some promises to behave differently. State attorneys general fear this sort of anticlimactic ending, which is part of why they&#8217;re filing separate suits, giving them leverage to move independently if they think the Justice Department might settle too soon or too leniently.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Ephrat Livni</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lauren-hirsch" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid3-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid3"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="tesla-is-on-track-to-report-its-first-annual-profit-but-its-growth-may-be-slowing"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#tesla-is-on-track-to-report-its-first-annual-profit-but-its-growth-may-be-slowing">Tesla is on track to report its first annual profit, but its growth may be slowing.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Tesla Model 3 cars at the company&#8217;s factory in Shanghai.

In China, Tesla has cut prices several times this year and sales of the Model 3 sedans it makes in Shanghai declined slightly in September compared with August and July. In Europe, the company faces growing competition from traditional automakers.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;Tesla is losing ground in Europe to fierce competitors&#8221; that have offered more affordable electric models, Vicki Bryan, the chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said in a report. Ms. Bryan also said Tesla&#8217;s Model Y hatchback seemed to be taking sales away from the Model 3 rather than adding to the company&#8217;s sales.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla said this month that it delivered 139,000 cars in the third quarter. That was about a 50 percent increase from the second quarter, when sales and production were severely hampered by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The company&#8217;s chief executive, Elon Musk, last month appeared to temper expectations when he forecast that sales would rise 30 to 40 percent this year, implying a range of 482,000 to 514,000 cars.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla would have to sell 182,000 cars in the fourth quarter to sell more than 500,000 cars for the year. Most analysts expect sales for the full year to fall short of that mark, however. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company delivered 112,000 cars.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Analysts expect Tesla to report earnings of 55 cents a share for the third quarter, according to a consensus compiled by FactSet. The company earned 50 cents a share in the second quarter, and 78 cents a share in the third quarter of last year.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Tesla&#8217;s profits have often been helped by the sale of credits to other automakers who need them to meet environmental regulations. In the second quarter, the company reported $428 million in credit revenue.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">While several automakers have introduced electric vehicles, Tesla so far has faced little serious competition. But that could change over the next year or so.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">On Tuesday evening, General Motors offered a preview of a battery-powered and technology-packed Hummer pickup truck that it plans to begin selling in about 12 months. The Hummer EV is supposed to go 350 miles or more on a single charge &#8212; in line with Tesla&#8217;s top models. Cameras embedded all around the truck allow drivers 18 different views of where the vehicle is going and what it is driving over. All four wheels will have the ability to turn, allowing it to drive diagonally, a feature G.M. is calling &#8220;Crabwalk.&#8221; G.M. promises the truck will be able to charge enough to travel 100 miles in just 10 minutes.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The first edition will start at $112,595. Other editions due in 2022 and later will be available under $100,000.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The Hummer EV is meant to compete with Tesla&#8217;s pickup, the Cybertruck, which is supposed to go into production late next year.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neal-e-boudette" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="wall-street-awaits-stimulus-talks-in-washington"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#wall-street-awaits-stimulus-talks-in-washington">Wall Street awaits stimulus talks in Washington.</a></h2><p class="css-17dprlf"></p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">U.S. stocks climbed on Wednesday, while Europe&#8217;s benchmark stock indexes headed lower as the region&#8217;s central bank warned of the risk to Europe&#8217;s economy from a second wave of the pandemic.</p></li><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">The S&amp;P 500 was barely higher.

  Ending government stimulus and furlough schemes too soon would tip economies back into recession, the International Monetary Fund has warned the UK and European governments.The lender of last resort said the outlook for the European economy “remains bleak” as it cautioned that cutting state support early risks “undoing much of what has been achieved”.“A premature scaling back of supportive policies could drag countries back into recession,” the IMF said in its regional economic outlook for Europe.The IMF expects the UK economy to contract 9.8pc in 2020 - a slightly smaller hit than previously expected.However, the recovery is also expected to be slower with GDP set to rise 5.9pc and 3.2pc in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

<div><p>Ending government stimulus and furlough schemes too soon would tip economies back into recession, the International Monetary Fund has warned the UK and European governments.</p>
<p>The lender of last resort said the outlook for the European economy &#8220;remains bleak&#8221; as it cautioned that cutting state support early risks &#8220;undoing much of what has been achieved&#8221;.</p>
<p>It advised governments to keep pumping money into viable businesses and jobs amid fears that unemployment in the UK could rise sharply as support is withdrawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;A premature scaling back of supportive policies could drag countries back into recession,&#8221; the IMF said in its regional economic outlook for Europe.</p>
<p>It also warned a no deal Brexit would deliver another blow to the UK and European economies as talks between the Government and Brussels flounder. It said the risk of a no-deal Brexit was &#8220;high&#8221; and would cause an &#8220;additional and potentially sizable shock to activity&#8221;.</p>

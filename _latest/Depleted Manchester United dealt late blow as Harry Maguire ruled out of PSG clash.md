<div><p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been dealt a blow on the eve of Manchester United&#8217;s return to the Champions League with Harry Maguire ruled out through injury. Bruno Fernandes will captain the team against Paris Saint-Germain.&#160;</p>
<p>Maguire picked up a muscle injury at the weekend and is now a concern for Saturday's match against Chelsea. He adds to the injury problems faced by Solskjaer as his squad travelled to France without Edinson Cavani, Mason Greenwood, Eric Bailly and Jesse Lingard.&#160;</p>
<p>The United manager announced his captain to face last year&#8217;s finalists as Fernandes sat next to him at the pre-match press conference, which came as a surprise to the Portugal midfielder who has only been at the club for nine months.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope Harry will be fit for the weekend, we're not sure but we hope. The captain sits next to me, Bruno will captain the team,&#8221; said Solskjaer. &#8220;We've lost a couple, so that's Bailly who didn't travel and&#160;Lingard didn't travel. We're a little bit depleted but have more than enough players.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fernandes&#8217; elevation to skipper could be seen as a snub to Paul Pogba, who was stripped of the vice-captaincy during Jose Mourinho&#8217;s time at United. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/19/ander-herrera-exclusive-interview-respect-manchester-united/">PSG midfielder Ander Herrera</a>, who faces his old club, suggested Pogba would be on the list of Ballon D&#8217;Or nominees if he was part of a team winning important titles.&#160;</p>

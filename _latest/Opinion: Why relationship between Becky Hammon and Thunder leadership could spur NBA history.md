  Opinion: Why relationship between Becky Hammon and Thunder leadership could spur NBA history 
description: > 
  The first to be a head coach in the NBA’s developmental league.Oklahoma City has yet to hire a new head coach, a delay that may well be a cost-cutting move.Neither Scott Brooks nor Donovan had been a head coach in the NBA before Presti hired them to lead the Thunder.All of that could increase the likelihood the Thunder make history and hire the first female head coach in NBA history.But if she becomes the next head coach of the Thunder, it won’t just be because of that.

The first to play in a men&#8217;s pro basketball league, the USBL. The first to be a head coach in the NBA&#8217;s developmental league.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She knows what it takes to go where others haven't.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">What, then, is the barrier keeping a woman from being a head coach in the NBA?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Well, I can&#8217;t really tell you what the barrier is," Lieberman said, "but you know, more and more women are getting the opportunity to establish relationships not only with teams, but with the NBA."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And those relationships are key.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">More than six weeks ago, the Oklahoma City Thunder and Billy Donovan parted ways. Oklahoma City has yet to hire a new head coach, a delay that may well be a cost-cutting move. Another day without a coach at a time the pandemic has slashed revenues is another day without a big salary on the books.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But eventually, the Thunder will need a head coach.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Might they hire a woman? Sure seems possible.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">CLIPPERS:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/clippers/2020/10/21/clippers-doc-rivers-firing-ty-lue-hiring-chemistry/3720477001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Fixing chemistry issues might be Lue's biggest challenge</a></p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-basketball-nba-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">PACERS:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pacers/2020/10/20/pacers-new-coach-nate-bjorkgren-total-unknown-which-may-ok/5998900002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Best (and worst) thing about Bjorkgren?

Nowhere is that more evident than his last two head-coaching hires. Neither Scott Brooks nor Donovan had been a head coach in the NBA before Presti hired them to lead the Thunder.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-basketball-nba-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That&#8217;s no small thing. Lots of teams default to head coaches who have done the job before, even if they haven&#8217;t always done it all that well.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That has not been Presti&#8217;s track record, and with budget concerns due to the coronavirus, the Thunder might not want to shell out big money to lure someone with previous head coaching experience anyway.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">All of that could increase the likelihood the Thunder make history and hire the first female head coach in NBA history.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If it happens, here&#8217;s guessing it would be <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5674481/carlson-why-the-relationship-between-becky-hammon-and-okc-thunder-leadership-could-spur-nba-history?" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Becky Hammon</a>.</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Becky Hammon has been a Spurs assistant coach for six seasons."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That isn&#8217;t entirely because she&#8217;s the most high-profile and most highly-qualified woman on an NBA bench, although she is that. She has been on Gregg Popovich&#8217;s coaching staff with the San Antonio Spurs since 2014, when she became the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2014/08/05/spurs-female-assistant-becky-hammon/13623937/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">first woman hired as a full-time assistant in NBA history</a>. A few years later, she became the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/spurs/2018/06/27/spurs-promote-assistant-coach-becky-hammon/739735002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">first woman to be a front-row assistant</a>. That&#8217;s a distinction reserved for head coaches&#8217; most trusted and most respected assistants.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And if you&#8217;re one of Pop&#8217;s most trusted, most respected assistants, that means you know your stuff.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Hammon does.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But if she becomes the next head coach of the Thunder, it won&#8217;t just be because of that.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"You will not get hired on a r&#233;sum&#233;," Lieberman said. "You will get hired on a relationship.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The women who are starting to break into the NBA, it&#8217;s been relationships."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That&#8217;s how Hammon got hired, meeting Popovich on a flight back from the 2012 Olympics in London. She impressed him enough to get invited to attend a couple Spurs meetings and practices &#8212; she was playing for San Antonio&#8217;s WNBA team at the time &#8212; and when she retired from playing, Pop hired her.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It wasn&#8217;t about bringing a girl on board," Hammon told ESPN.com earlier this year. "It&#8217;s about that person fitting with the group."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She had impressed Popovich with her basketball knowledge and coaching acumen during the meetings and practices, but Hammon had continued to build a bond, too. There was a relationship that gave Popovich peace of mind that Hammon would be a good fit.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Might Presti think similarly about her?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">There's little doubt he has a relationship with Hammon. His Spurs ties are well chronicled. Ditto for Popovich&#8217;s affinity for Presti. Maybe Presti and Hammon crossed paths at one of Pop&#8217;s legendary dinners. Maybe when Presti popped into the Spurs offices to visit old friends. Maybe when Hammon was in the back hallway before a game at The Peake.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-sports-basketball-nba-4" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">There&#8217;s a good chance Clay Bennett, front man for the Thunder&#8217;s ownership group, knows Hammon, too. Like Presti, Bennett has a history with the Spurs, and those connections mean he has likely gotten to know Hammon.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If they know her, it increases the chances they will hire her.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We do have qualified women who could be a head coach in this league," Lieberman said, referring to nearly a dozen women who are currently NBA assistants, "but it&#8217;s entrusting your billion-dollar franchise to somebody who&#8217;s never done it before, right?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It&#8217;s sometimes unfortunately easier to hire people that maybe you&#8217;d have a little more comfortability with than it being viewed as kind of a little bit of a risk to bring in a woman."</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/nba/2020/05/23/nba-jerseys-power-rankings-best-threads/5239204002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lieberman added she doesn&#8217;t believe hiring a woman as head coach would be a risk.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"But people own their own businesses," Lieberman said. "They&#8217;re entitled to hire who they want and who they feel comfortable entrusting their leadership to."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The first team to hire a female head coach will be doing something no NBA franchise has ever done before, and no matter what, some people will see that as a gamble. But if the people doing the hiring don&#8217;t feel that way, that is important.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And if you&#8217;re hiring someone you personally know, it makes you more comfortable.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lieberman knows the importance of that first hand. Hired by the Sacramento Kings to be an assistant in 2015, she believes her friends in the league were crucial in helping her get in the door. She counts current head coaches Rick Carlisle in Dallas and Nick Nurse in Toronto among that group.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She had advocates and champions. She suspects the same will be true when a woman finally goes from candidate to coach.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It&#8217;ll be when the time is right for the right franchise," Lieberman said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Why not the Thunder? Why not now?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jenni Carlson is a columnist for The Oklahoman, part of the USA TODAY Network.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/nba/2020/10/01/nba-finals-best-photos-miami-heat-los-angeles-lakers/5875613002/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

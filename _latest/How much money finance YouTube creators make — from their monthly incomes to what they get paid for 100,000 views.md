This is the latest installment of Business Insider's YouTube money logs, where creators break down how much they earn.

The attorney Erika Kullberg started her personal-finance YouTube channel one year ago after leaving her job as a corporate lawyer, and she now has about 71,500 subscribers.

Though Kullberg's YouTube channel doesn't have millions of subscribers, she is still able to earn a sizeable amount of money each month because of her video content and the audience her channel attracts. She films videos about personal finance, passive income, investing, and stimulus-package updates.

Toward the end of April, Kullberg's channel was accepted into YouTube's Partner Program — making May the first month she earned revenue off YouTube, she said. Her channel reached 1.8 million views that month, and her most viewed videos were about the stimulus package.

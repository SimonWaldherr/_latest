  Jack Harlow Teases New Single 'Tyler Herro' Dropping October 22 
description: > 
  Manuel Mazzanti/Associated PressTyler Herro spent the entire NBA bubble dropping buckets.The rapper announced his new single, titled "Tyler Herro," will drop Thursday in a Twitter post that features Herro and Harlow doing their own jersey swap.There's no word on whether Herro himself will be laying down any rhymes on the track, which is almost certain to set NBA Twitter ablaze.Harlow, who ascended to stardom this year with "What's Poppin'," has made a habit of befriending NBA players in recent months.Hopefully, Harlow's rhymes on his song in honor of Herro do the sweet-shooting guard some justice.

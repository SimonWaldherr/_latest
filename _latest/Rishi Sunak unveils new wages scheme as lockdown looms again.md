On Friday, Mr Sunak announced that hundreds of millions of pounds a month will be spent paying workers at companies forced to close by new coronavirus restrictions.

The cash is not limited to pubs, bars and restaurants, fuelling fears that closures will be widened to further businesses in a return to a full-scale lockdown.

The scheme will see taxpayers cover two thirds of the wages of staff in firms that have to close for up to six months, and there is no limit on how much it will cost.

In a significant expansion of the job support scheme, employees will no longer have to work part-time in order to qualify for the wage subsidy. Businesses ordered to close prior to any fresh additional restrictions will also qualify, throwing venues such nightclubs, which have been shut since March, a vital lifeline.

The Chancellor admitted he did not know how much the scheme will cost, although Treasury sources estimated it would be hundreds of millions of pounds per month.

"We obviously wonâ€™t know the exact take-up of something like this because as we enter an uncertain period the exact scope of any restrictions is uncertain at this time," he said.

It came as Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, told MPs and peers on Friday that the UK is back where it was in March as hospitals fill up with coronavirus patients.

Prof Van-Tam said the North-West's intensive care beds were "two to three doubling times" away from capacity. A separate Government-backed study said hospital admissions in the area could be doubling every week.

On Friday, Professor Graham Medley, who sits on the Government's scientific advisory panel Sage, also warned that Britain is in a "similar position to early March" and that "thousands will die unless we do something".

The Government said that, as of 9am on Friday, there had been a further 13,864 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK.

It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 575,679. There are now 3,090 Covid-19 patients in England's hospitals. On March 23, the day lockdown was imposed, there were 3,097.

Under plans to be set out by Mr Johnson on Monday, England will be partitioned into three different tiers from the middle of next week according to the severity of local virus outbreaks.

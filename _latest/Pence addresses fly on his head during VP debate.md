Vice President Mike Pence on Monday said that he wasn’t aware of the show-stealing fly that sat atop his head during last week’s vice presidential debate.

“I didn’t know he was there,” Pence told Fox News host Dana Perino in a Columbus Day interview from Ohio.

The black horsefly sat on Pence’s neatly combed gray hair for 2 minutes and 9 seconds as he debated Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris in Salt Lake City.

Pence, a father of three adult children, said he did not feel the fly and only learned of its existence from his kids after the debate.

“They all told me, ‘Dad, you did okay’, but they did tell me about the fly. It was a good laugh for all of us,” Pence said.

The Pence-Harris debate on Oct. 7 featured the candidates separated by plexiglass as President Trump recuperated from COVID-19 at the White House.

It was the only scheduled vice presidential debate and attention on the fly eclipsed other exchanges, such as Pence faulting Harris (D-Calif.) for racial disparities in her prosecution while she was district attorney of San Francisco.

One more presidential debate is scheduled before the Nov. 3 election — next week in Nashville, Tenn.

Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden were scheduled for a second debate Thursday in Miami, but the Commission on President Debates canceled the forum after Trump rejected their request to make it a virtual debate.

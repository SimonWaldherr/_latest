That loss of momentum is however very much sector specific. Outside hospitality, entertainment, airlines and events, most businesses have learned to live with Covid restrictions, and operate relatively effectively within them. Assuming schools remain open, and that travel isn’t again banned, there is no reason to believe that the rest of the economy is about to slump back down again. Admittedly, there is not much to look forward to these days, but much of the country has indeed learned to live without fear, as Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, has urged.

As for the mortgage market, that’s going gangbusters, despite the almost universal belief that house prices are heading for some kind of correction once the stamp duty holiday ends next year. The Prime Minister is keen to keep that going, with an out of the blue suggestion at the Conservative Party virtual conference of bringing back mortgages that require only a 5pc deposit.

The banks, and indeed the Bank of England – which confusingly issued a report last week which significantly increases the risk rate it attaches to mortgage lending, and therefore the amount of capital banks have to put against it – might have something to say about that, given the experience of negative equity in the last two housing market crashes. Unless the Treasury is prepared to further use the public balance sheet to underwrite such mortgages along with everything else, there seems little immediate chance of the idea becoming a reality. From the Treasury, answer comes there none.

Still, the Government can at least expect the banks to be part of the solution to the crisis this time around, unlike last time when they were the major cause of it. With capital buffers restored, and little sign so far of the tsunami of corporate insolvencies widely predicted in the initial stages of the crisis, they have ample scope to support the economy with balance sheet expansion. But for second wave fears, the road to recovery would by now be clear and broad.

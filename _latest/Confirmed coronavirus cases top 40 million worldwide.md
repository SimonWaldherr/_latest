  Confirmed coronavirus cases top 40 million worldwide 
description: > 
  The number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the planet now exceeds 40 million.The actual worldwide figure of coronavirus infections is likely to be far higher, as testing has been variable, many people have had no symptoms and some governments have concealed the true number of cases.To date, more than 1.1 million confirmed COVID-19 deaths have been reported, although experts believe that number, too, to be an undercount.Last week, the World Health Organization said Europe had a reported a record weekly high of nearly 700,000 cases and said that the region was responsible for about a third of cases globally.Britain, France, Russia and Spain account for about half of all new cases in the region.

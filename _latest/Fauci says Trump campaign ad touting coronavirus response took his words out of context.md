Using grounded planes as novelty concept restaurants could provide a much-needed revenue stream for the struggling airline industry, if Singapore Airlines’ recent success is any indication.

On Monday, the carrier began allowing people to reserve seats at “A380@Changi,” a pop-up restaurant located on board an Airbus A380 that never leaves Changi Airport. Within 30 minutes, hundreds of tickets had sold out, according to Bloomberg News. Prices had ranged from $53.50 in Singaporean dollars (the equivalent of $39.50) for a meal served in an economy seat to $642 Singaporean (roughly $474 in U.S. dollars) for a suite.

Singapore Airlines initially planned to only offer the dinners during one weekend in October, and is now drawing up a waiting list to figure out how it will meet demand, Bloomberg reported. Before announcing the pop-up restaurant, the company had considered selling tickets for “flights to nowhere,” which take off and return from the same airport with no stops in between. Intended to generate profits during the downturn by appealing to people who are nostalgic for air travel, the trend has been widely criticized for its environmental impact.

Diners at “A380@Changi” won’t get to see anything out the Airbus’ windows, but they’ll be able to enjoy complimentary drinks and a meal prepared by Shermay Lee, a well-known Singaporean chef. They’ll also get a behind-the-scenes tour of the A380, which is considered one of the world’s most luxurious airplanes, according to Business Insider. And they’ll get to go home with the amenity kits that are typically handed out to premium cabin travelers.

The Airbus A380 typically seats as many as 471 people, but capacity will be slashed in half to comply with social distancing guidelines, Bloomberg reported.

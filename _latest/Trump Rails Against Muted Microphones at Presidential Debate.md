  Trump Rails Against Muted Microphones at Presidential Debate

  We've been winning for so long," Trump, who has been trailing in national and battleground state polls, said on "Fox & Friends" Tuesday.The fact that Trump is willing to debate Biden again without being able to interrupt him at will is an indicator of how much the president needs to change the trajectory of the campaign.In Pennsylvania, Biden is ahead by just 4 percentage points, 49% to 45% for Trump, according to an Ipsos/Reuters poll released Monday.Thursday's debate offers the president what may be his final chance to weaken Biden in the final stretch of the campaign.But without interruptions from Trump, Biden could do what the Trump campaign hopes he will do â€“ make a gaffe or misstep.

<div><p><a href="//www.usnews.com/elections/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> will not go quietly. Even if voters won't be able to hear him.</p><p>The president Tuesday morning railed against new debate rules providing for the muting of his and Democratic nominee<a href="/elections/joe-biden"> Joe Biden</a>'s microphones while the competing candidate is delivering his initial, two-minute response to a moderator question at Thursday's second and final presidential debate in Nashville.</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>The rules, announced Monday by the Commission on Presidential Debates, are meant to avert the chaotic and widely denounced display in the first debate, when moderator Chris Wallace had to repeatedly demand that the candidates &#8211; mostly the president &#8211; stop talking over his opponent.</p><p>"The whole thing is crazy. It's so set up. It's incredible. We've been winning for so long," Trump, who has been trailing in national and battleground state polls, said on "Fox &amp; Friends" Tuesday. "These are not good people. This commission &#8211; a lot of funny things go on microphone with them," he added.</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on the 2020 Election</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/e122dd2/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fdb%2F15%2F841be3fb4587a8ad9b19842d1e3c%2F20201016edptc-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>Trump went on to accuse the commission of "stifling out" his microphone in 2016 when he debated <a href="//www.usnews.com/news/articles/2007/01/30/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-hillary-clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>. Actually, there was an audio problem that made it hard for people in the auditorium to hear him but did not keep the tens of million of debate viewers watching at home from hearing him. He criticized moderator Kristen Welker, saying she was an unfair choice because her parents have contributed to Democratic candidates' campaigns.</p><p>The fact that Trump is willing to debate Biden again without being able to interrupt him at will is an indicator of how much the president needs to change the trajectory of the campaign.</p><p>Polling does appear to be tightening somewhat: A <a href="https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/porl/FLFallOct2020.pdf" target="_blank">University of North Florida poll</a> released Tuesday morning, for example, shows the two men in a virtual tie, with Biden getting the support of 48% of likely voters and Trump, 47% support. In Pennsylvania, Biden is ahead by just 4 percentage points, 49% to 45% for Trump, according to an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-10/topline_reuters_pennsylvania_state_poll_w4_10_19_20.pdf" target="_blank">Ipsos/Reuters poll </a>released Monday. Either state could determine the outcome of the election.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>And Biden's own campaign has warned supporters that the race is far closer than public polls indicate.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Still, Trump is appearing more and more frantic as Election Day approaches, saying Biden should be jailed and calling a reporter "a criminal" for not promoting an unsubstantiated story about Biden's son Hunter that the Trump campaign believes could derail the former vice president, much as Clinton's email controversy damaged her late in the the 2016 race.</p><p>On Monday night as he campaigned at a rally in Arizona, Trump said America was tired of hearing about the coronavirus and criticized Biden for listening to scientists &#8211; a slam the Biden campaign was happy to let the president make. In a call with campaign staff, the president denounced infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci and "these idiots" in the government warning people about another fall spike in infections.</p><p>Thursday's debate offers the president what may be his final chance to weaken Biden in the final stretch of the campaign.</p><p>For Biden, the microphone muting is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it provides relief from Trump's barrage of accusations &#8211; much like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsije1KetVw" target="_blank">"Saturday Night Live" sketch</a> lampooning the first debate, in which Jim Carrey, playing Biden, flips out a remote control and "mutes" Alec Baldwin playing Trump.</p><p>But without interruptions from Trump, Biden could do what the Trump campaign hopes he will do &#8211; make a gaffe or misstep.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"Actually, the interesting thing is they said if you let him talk, he'll lose his chain of thought because he's gonzo," Trump said on the Fox program, when he talked over reporters as they attempted to ask him if he would interrupt Biden less in the final debate.</p><p>"There is a chain of thought, that there are a lot of people that say let him talk, because he loses his train &#8211; he loses his train. He loses his mind, frankly," Trump said. This time, at least, voters will be able to hear both candidates make their cases &#8211; or flub them.<br></p></div>

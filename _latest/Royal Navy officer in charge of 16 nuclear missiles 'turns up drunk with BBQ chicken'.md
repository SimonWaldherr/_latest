 <p>     </p> <p>Lt Louw's role was to look after the missiles, which contain three nuclear warheads each.</p> <p>They are roughly as powerful as 30 of the bombs which were dropped on Hiroshima.</p> <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12961073/royal-navy-officer-drunk-bbq-chicken-nukes/" rel="nofollow">The Sun</a> : &#8220;He was not in a fit state to be in charge of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>&#8220;The person he was taking over from realised something was seriously wrong. They had no choice but to alert the higher ups.&#8221;</p> <p align="left">When Lt Louw, in his 40s, arrived at the &#163;3billion sub his crewmates were about to offload the missile, which he was charged with maintaining.</p>

   <p>An investigation into his actions has since been launched.</p> <p>The incident is the latest scandal to befall the Vanguard-class sub.</p> <p>Previously a former captain and first mate were removed from the vessel for sleeping with female junior officers.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

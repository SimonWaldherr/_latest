As co-founder Virgil Abloh launches Off-White™’s Nike Air Rubber Dunk, RSVP Gallery celebrates 10 years in the business of streetwear. Appropriately, the retailer is commemorating the momentous occasion with a thoughtful digital yearbook packed with imagery, quotes and memorable moments sourced from 2009 to 2019.

Anchored by interviews with Abloh, co-founder Don C and Kristen Crawley, the yearbook spotlights friends like A$AP Rocky and Rihanna, former staff like Easy Otabor and Aleali May and introduces the label’s first designer-in-residence, Kristopher Kites. Snapshots from RSVP Gallery’s history include in-store launches, displays, editorials and collaborations, celebrating the store’s ongoing experiments in pushing the envelope. “It was always about Community RSVP, and I’m proud to see that still exists,” says Abloh in his interview.

Meanwhile, Abloh recently joined the board of the Fashion Scholarship Fund.

When Harris ran for reelection as California's attorney general in 2014, Benioff cohosted a fundraiser for her campaign, according to a tweet from Recode's Teddy Schleifer.

"Kamala is one of the highest-integrity people I've ever met and is a phenomenal prosecutor," Benioff told Recode in February 2019. "She is truly an impressive leader with a strong legal and public service background."

However, Benioff is unlikely to publicly support the Harris-Biden ticket in the run-up to the 2020 election: earlier this year, he told Recode that since buying Time Magazine, he will "no longer make political positions or funding."

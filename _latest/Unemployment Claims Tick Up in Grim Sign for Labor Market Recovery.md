The number of people filing for unemployment benefits increased last week to 898,000, a worrying sign that the job market's recovery from the pandemic-induced recession is slowing.

The figure, released Thursday by the Labor Department, is an increase of 53,000 from the previous week, and is the highest level since mid-August.

Claims have stagnated between 800,000 and 900,000 for the past seven weeks after falling from a peak of nearly 7 million in March. The levels are historically high – the pre-pandemic record for weekly claims sat just shy of 700,000.

An additional 373,000 people applied for jobless aid through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which was created by Congress earlier this year to help workers who would not otherwise qualify for unemployment.

There are encouraging signs that employers are hiring and rehiring workers, however. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits on a continuous basis fell notably during the week ending Oct. 3, down to roughly 10 million from nearly 11.2 million the week prior.

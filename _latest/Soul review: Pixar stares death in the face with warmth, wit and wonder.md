Ordinarily, the hottest ticket at the London Film Festival would not be a major studio animation showing mere weeks ahead of its worldwide release. But as the industry continues to bob and flail in Covid’s slipstream, the prospect of ordinary times feels distant indeed.

Earlier this week, Disney abandoned its plans to open Soul in cinemas this November, announcing that it would instead be leapfrogging straight to the Disney+ streaming service for a synchronised international Christmas Day launch.

That means the lucky few who caught Soul at one of this evening's festival screenings will be among the only people in the world to see the latest Pixar film in a cinema, with an audience – for the foreseeable future, at least. Even if Soul were another Cars 3 or Monsters University, this would be regrettable enough.

But the latest film from Pete Docter, the director of Monsters Inc, Up and (crucially) Inside Out, sees the studio ascend Himalayan new peaks of imagination, artistry and insight. That isn’t to understate the sheer ingenuity and nerve it must have taken, back in the early 1990s, to come up with a film as revolutionary as Toy Story.

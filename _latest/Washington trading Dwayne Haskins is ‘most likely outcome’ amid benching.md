Dwayne Haskins’ nightmare in Washington could be coming to an end soon.

The 2019 first-round pick — who has had an all-around dreadful week — may be headed to a different team before the Nov. 3 NFL trade deadline.

CBS Sports reported on Sunday that “multiple sources within the organization believe a trade by the end of the month is the most likely outcome.”

The 23-year-old quarterback was benched earlier in the week for backup and undrafted free agent Kyle Allen, who got the start in Week 5. Haskins was also demoted to third-string on the depth chart behind Alex Smith, who had not appeared in an NFL game since he sustained a life-threatening leg injury in 2018.

The move signaled there could be more nefarious forces at play within the organization, which has just five winning seasons over the last two decades. The team has been in perpetual rebuild mode for years and squandered multiple first-round picks via trades and questionable management decisions.

There were rumors earlier this week that the young signal-caller’s relationship with new head coach Ron Rivera had frayed and reached toxic levels.

CBS Sports reported there is a “strong perception” that Haskins only became the starter because of his personal relationship with team owner Daniel Snyder. He also cited Haskins’ personality as a point of friction between him and members of the coaching staff.

“What they’ll tell you in that building is that he is a project who was drafted by the owner and his son,” a league source told the website. “That’s the bottom line there. Allen is their guy. They think he fits their system. They didn’t really want anything to do with Haskins from the beginning.”

The Ohio State product was selected 15th overall in the 2019 NFL Draft under a Jay Gruden-led regime in Washington. Gruden was fired five games into Haskins’ tenure with the team, which quickly snapped up Rivera after his in-season ousting in Carolina.

Sources close to Haskins’ camp told CBS they aren’t likely to put up a fight should the organization attempt to deal him before the deadline, and called a trade “far and away the best outcome possible.”

Allen, 24, briefly overlapped with Rivera in his final season with the Panthers. He started 13 games in relief of an injured Cam Newton and passed for 3,322 yards, 17 touchdowns and 16 interceptions in 2019. Washington acquired him in March in exchange for a 2020 fifth-round pick.

Allen was injured during Sunday’s loss to the Rams and was spelled by Smith. The Football Team dropped to 1-4 on the season and will take on the winless Giants in Week 6.

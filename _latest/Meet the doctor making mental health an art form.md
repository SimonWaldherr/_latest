The Capacity Cup by Dr Emma Hepburn

Grab yourself a cup of tea, any cup will do. Now sit back and enjoy. No, hold on! Before you do, take a good look at that cup and think about it in a different way. Imagine the space inside the cup – it has limited capacity, and if it gets too full it will overflow. This cup represents your emotional capacity. It is your capacity cup.

We all have limited emotional capacity. Everything you do fills your cup. Mundane, small things might take up a tiny bit of capacity. Two small children running around requires more resources to manage, so takes up a larger amount of capacity. Do you have stressful life events coming up, a job interview or some medical tests? Capacity will be taken up thinking about these. Even good things, such as visiting friends, will use some capacity.

Here are three ways to manage your capacity before your cup overflows and you reach the point of being overwhelmed.

1. Shake it real good

Chuck some things out of your cup. Is there anything in there that can be binned? Can you ask someone to help? Sometimes we are reluctant to throw things out as we feel we should be able to manage it all and are failing if we don’t. However, chucking things out is a form of active coping, enabling you to dedicate more resources to the important things.

2. Enough is enough

It’s time to say NO. If you are near capacity, try to keep things out of your cup when you can. Before you take on something new, ask yourself if it will push your cup over capacity. If the answer is YES, then the answer is NO to the new thing. Of course, this isn’t always possible, and saying no can be hard. But it’s an important skill to learn.

3. Doing it for yourself

Taking time for yourself can seem like a waste of precious resources. A classic example is missing lunch because you have too much on. However, looking after yourself actually increases your capacity, because it lowers your stress and gives you more brain space. Try to encourage good sleeping habits and diet, take regular breaks and do something that makes you feel good, in the knowledge it will better equip you to deal with everything else in your cup.

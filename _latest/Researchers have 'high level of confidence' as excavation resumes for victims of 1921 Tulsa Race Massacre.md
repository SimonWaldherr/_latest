  Researchers have 'high level of confidence' as excavation resumes for victims of 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre 
description: > 
  Associated PressTULSA, Okla. â€” Excavation work began Monday at two locations in a Tulsa cemetery for victims of a race massacre nearly 100 years ago that left hundreds dead and decimated an area that was once a cultural and economic mecca for African Americans.Researchers took a core soil sample at one location to give them a better idea of what lies beneath the soil, said Oklahoma State Archeologist Kary Stackelbeck.Both areas of interests are in Oaklawn Cemetery in north Tulsa, where a search for remains of victims ended without success in July, and near the Greenwood District where the massacre happened.Fact check:Devastating 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre wasn't worst U.S. riot, isn't ignored in booksStackelbeck noted that researchers have a "high level of confidence" some remains will be found in an area known as the Original 18, where old funeral home records indicate up to 18 Black people who were massacre victims were buried.If bodies are discovered, researchers will try to determine if there are signs of trauma that could indicate they were massacre victims, said Phoebe Stubblefield, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Florida who is assisting in the search effort.

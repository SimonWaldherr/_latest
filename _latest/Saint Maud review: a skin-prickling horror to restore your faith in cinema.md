  Saint Maud review: a skin-prickling horror to restore your faith in cinema

“You’re getting dangerously Norma Desmond,” one of Amanda’s old friends (Marcus Hutton) chides – and, slumped regally on the couch in her headscarf and dressing gown, she certainly looks the Sunset Boulevard part. Maud, however, is not the parasitic William Holden type: while she’s partly bewitched by this older woman, she also quickly comes to regard her as a soul to be urgently saved. From what, though?

It turns out to be more a question of whom: she’s Carol (Lily Frazer), Amanda’s vivacious young female ‘companion’, who comes to visit most evenings and occasionally shoots Maud a smirk while swanning past her to retrieve another bottle of champagne from the fridge.

Maud’s obsession curdles into resentment, which in turn triggers a spiralling descent into full-blown fire-and-brimstone psychosis. Amanda initially attempts to smooth things over with a book of demonic William Blake paintings, which in this case is a bit like trying to patch things up with an arsonist by giving them a monogrammed Zippo.

With tingly overtones of Lynne Ramsay, Roman Polanski and Lars von Trier, Saint Maud is a film to be approached with caution – and also pure cinephile zeal. Glass is less interested in pinning down her anti-heroine as either a prophetess or fantasist than cornering her audience with the possibility that either one could be the case, even as we watch events unfold exclusively from Maud’s unswervingly devout perspective.

Those aforementioned rapturous visitations look genuine enough. In one extraordinary scene, Maud is struck down while climbing the staircase in Amanda’s house, and it’s as if the floral tendrils on the faded Arts and Crafts wallpaper are writhing in sympathy. In another, she arches backwards and starts to levitate while a (possibly New Year’s Eve) fireworks display booms and crackles outside – a moment of impregnable cinematic terror and strangeness.

Even Scarborough itself feels a touch otherworldly, from the churning overcast skies to the winking lights of the seafront amusements, which take on a groggy, hallucinatory pall.

Georgia May Jagger: model, rock progeny… MasterChef contestant ?

‘I cooked a lot over lockdown,’ she says with pride. She and Louis Levy, her restaurateur boyfriend, took it in turns to prepare dinner over spring and summer while sheltering in Georgia May’s Los Angeles home. Sometimes,they raised the stakes. ‘One night we decided to do a stir-fry competition. We each made our own stir-fries and then compared. He won. Well, that’s what we decided,’ she clarifies, a flash in her green eyes and a gap-toothed grin confirming that she has a different idea about who truly produced the superior dish . ‘But we didn’t have a third judge, so it’s definitely a bit up in the air.’

Stir-frying, dog-walking, wardrobe-sorting, bread-baking (‘I tried to make focaccia and mainly got flour everywhere’), tomato-cultivating, DIY-ing, reading, FaceTiming: Georgia May spent most of lockdown engaging in very normal activities, insofar as any pursuit can be normal in a time that is anything but. Not that her life lends itself to any description including the word ‘normal’, even in less extraordinary times.

Her mum is Jerry Hall, a woman whose own lockdown gardening proved so abundant she took to dropping off veg boxes in Bel Air neighbours’ drives – but also the ultimate glamazon and icon of the hedonistic 1970s fashion scene, now married to media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Her dad is Mick Jagger, no introduction needed. And Georgia May’s current state of contented domesticity stands in contrast to a childhood spent backstage at stadiums and on private jets.

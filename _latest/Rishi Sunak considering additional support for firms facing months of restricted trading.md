Rishi Sunak is considering additional financial support for businesses that face months of restricted trading due to large swathes of the country being banned from socialising in homes, pubs and restaurants.

The Treasury is understood to be looking at expanding the support available to firms which are not mandated to close and therefore unable to access the more generous support available to those in the most severe local lockdowns.

One option believed to be under consideration is to increase the generosity of the job support scheme, with a higher wage subsidy for businesses in tier two.

At present the scheme involves the Government paying 22 per cent of people’s wages for part-time working, with the employer contributing 55 per cent and the worker foregoing the rest.

In areas where hospitality and leisure venues are forced to shut, the Treasury will cover 66 per cent of wages, with employers only required to pay for national insurance and pension contributions.

However, with tens of millions of people due to be living under tier two restrictions from Saturday, Mr Sunak is being urged to either increase the generosity of the part-time subsidy or widen the eligibility of the local furlough strand.

Another option would see cash grants, which are available up to £3,000 a month for firms forced to close, extended to firms whose incomes have been slashed by the ban on household mixing.

Business groups are pressing the chancellor to change the criteria for grants to include those firms which are forced to close by “circumstance”, as well as though shut by law.

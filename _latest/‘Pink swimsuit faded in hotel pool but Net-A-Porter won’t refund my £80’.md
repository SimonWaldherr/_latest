Following my involvement, it has refunded your £80, and the item is being sent off for inspection. Had you been a social media influencer with a big following, you suspect you would not have required my help. Conversely, you believe you might have been showered with freebies to butter you up.

Rub salt in the wound through poor customer service at your peril. They will take their custom elsewhere.

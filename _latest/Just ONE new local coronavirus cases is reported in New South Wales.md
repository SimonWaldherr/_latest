New South Wales has recorded just one new locally transmitted coronavirus case as the state prepares to ease more social distancing restrictions.

The state announced just five new COVID-19 cases on Friday, four of which were in hotel quarantine.

The one new locally acquired case is a household contact of a previously reported case linked to the Lakemba cluster, which began when two local GPs tested positive.

The new cases come as the state prepares for looser rules around dining.

From Friday, venues are allowed to serve more customers outdoors.

The current four-square-metre social distancing rule, which determined how many people can be seated in a certain space, will be reduced.

The new two-square-metre rule for outdoor venues will mean more people will be able to cram into areas such as rooftop bars and outdoor eateries.

Up to 500 people are now allowed seated at outdoor events - an increase on the current limit of just 20 people.

The state recorded 11 new COVID-19 cases, six of which were locally acquired, on Thursday.

There was concern about a potential new outbreak in Sydney after new locally acquired cases were linked to the GP practice in Holden Street Lakemba.

Health authorities are continuing their call to residents to get tested as soon as they develop symptoms.

There were 16,391 tests reported to 8pm on Thursday night, compared with 15,802 in the previous 24 hours.

Chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant has urged residents in Sydney's west and northwest to come forward for testing after traces of the virus were detected at a treatment plant in Quakers Hill earlier this week.

Health Minister Brad Hazzard has also pleaded with NSW residents to be honest health officials to ensure they can track the chain of transmission.

'One of the ongoing problems that public health has had in NSW and also in Victoria is that people are not necessarily telling us the whole truth and nothing but the truth,' Mr Hazzard said.

Victoria's cases are continuing to tumble with the state recording its lowest infection figure in three months (Pictured, people in face masks walk around Melbourne's Albert Park Lake)

'Whether it's deliberate, whether its overlooked, you need to make sure it's neither of those things.

'Public health officials need to be able to track the chains of transmission and that's impossible if people don't give us the full picture of where they've been.'

Victoria's cases are continuing to tumble with the state recording its lowest infection figure in three months.

Victoria had just two new coronavirus cases found across the entire state and no deaths on Friday.

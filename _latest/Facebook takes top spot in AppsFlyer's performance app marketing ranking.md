The report ranks various media sources on their ability to retain, monetize, and retarget users on mobile devices&#8212;and Facebook's top spot means it's able to drive app installs by high-quality users (those likely to make purchases or stay on apps for long periods, for example).</p><p>

</p><p>Facebook's resurgence in the rankings is due in part to AppsFlyer introducing two new monetization-driven ranking categories.&#160;This edition added In-App Purchase (IAP) and In-App Advertising (IAA) categories, which rank media sources on how well they deliver users likely to make an in-app purchase and who are highly monetizable with ads, respectively.</p><p>Previously, retention was the key metric in AppsFlyer's methodology&#8212;so Google's strong focus on its App Campaigns tool last year helped it take first place overall. And while Google still leads Facebook in user retention, Facebook is ahead in its ability to monetize users, helping it cement its position in the top spot this year.&#160;</p><p>Our ad revenue estimates for Facebook and Google also reflect the two companies' respective strengths in the ad market.&#160;Last year, Google&#160;<a href="https://e.businessinsider.com/click/21803333.4/aHR0cHM6Ly9mb3JlY2FzdHMtbmExLmVtYXJrZXRlci5jb20vNTg0YjI2MDIxNDAzMDcwMjkwZjkzYTRhLzU4NTE5MThhMDYyNjMxMGEyYzE4NjljMg/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB17e423ab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made up</a>&#160;31.6% of all digital ad revenues, while Facebook accounted for 22.7%.

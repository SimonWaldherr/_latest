Borussia Dortmund 'were left baffled’ after Manchester United made a last-ditch attempt to sign Nico Schulz for £1million on transfer deadline day.

Having failed to sign Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's top target Jadon Sancho, United sought to bring Schulz to club on a season long loan instead.

United offered to pay the 27-year-old’s salary for the rest of the season but Dortmund rejected the deal and subsequently questioned the credentials of United’s recruitment team.

According to ESPN, Dortmund dismissed the approach from Manchester United chief Ed Woodward after the transfer saga surrounding Sancho.

United had been trying to secure the signature of Sancho for months but struggled to agree terms with the Bundesliga side, who would not budge on their £108million asking price. The club also had difficulties in talks with his agents.

Therefore, United had hoped to sign Schulz, who arrived at Dortmund following a £23m deal with Hoffenheim last summer.

Schultz enjoyed a very good campaign with Hoffenheim, who finished ninth in the Bundesliga during his time at the club. He scored twice and contributed nine assists in 37 matches across all competitions.

Schulz was called into the Germany senior squad for the first time in August 2018, making his debut in the friendly against Peru last September and scoring.

He has since scored two goals in 11 appearances for the national side, having found the net back in their Euro 2020 qualifier against Holland.

However, his career to Dortmund has been less fruitful - making just seven Bundesliga starts last season and only managing six minutes so far this season.

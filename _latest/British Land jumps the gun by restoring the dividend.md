As you would expect, the company’s version is that there has been a sudden improvement in its fortunes, but there’s only some truth in that. Footfall is 21pc ahead of forecasts, and sales have recovered to 90pc of where they were a year ago.

But the real measure is rent collections. In the quarter between March and June, 97pc of office rent payments were collected, versus just 44pc for retail clients, and equivalent to roughly two-thirds of what was owed.

There was improvement across the board in the following quarter between June and September with offices at 98pc and retail at 57pc but that still only equates to overall takings of 74pc. Or, put another way, a shortfall of more than a quarter, so isn’t it jumping the gun?

Sure, September’s collections were “encouraging” and are expected to improve further. The balance sheet is strong too with £1bn of cash and borrowings at its disposal but the outlook is hardly rosy, as it readily admits.

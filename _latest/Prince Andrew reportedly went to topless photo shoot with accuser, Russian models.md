<div><p>Prince Andrew allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/19/prince-andrew-feels-squeeze-to-talk-after-chef-stirs-pot-with-fbi/">laughed it up with Jeffrey Epstein</a> as they watched a teen sex trafficking victim and several Russian models taking part in a topless photo shoot in the pedophile multimillionaire&#8217;s Virgin Islands hideaway, according to a report about an explosive new book.</p>
<p>The Duke of York also <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/07/virginia-giuffre-recalls-alleged-sex-with-prince-andrew-in-memoir/">faces accusations</a> that Epstein&#8217;s &#8220;sex slave&#8221; Virginia Giuffre performed oral sex on him in front of a lesbian oil painting of herself as a teen while alleged madam Ghislaine Maxwell watched in 2002, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12959388/prince-andrew-topless-photo-shoot-teen-russian-models/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Sun reported</a> about investigative journalist <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spider-Criminal-Jeffrey-Epstein-Ghislaine/dp/0593237188?tag=nypost-20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barry Levine&#8217;s &#8220;The Spider</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were topless and he [Epstein] had us in sexual positions &#8230; when I walked in Andrew and Jeffrey were seated in chairs, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you girls start kissing and have some fun?&#8217;&#8221; Giuffre is quoted as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeffrey and the prince were just sitting back laughing,&#8221; she adds, according to &#8220;The Spider: Inside The Criminal Web of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,&#8221; which went on sale Tuesday.</p>
<p>A source close to the royal has described the new allegations as &#8220;unsubstantiated and lurid,&#8221; according to The Sun, which had obtained an advance copy of the salacious tome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another week, another person with a book to sell,&#8221; the source told the outlet. &#8220;More unsubstantiated and lurid allegations that have taken over 20 years to be remembered. We look forward to seeing the proof.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>Andrew has been accused of sleeping with Giuffre in New York, London and the Caribbean when she was still a minor. He has strongly denied the allegations.</p>
<p>In 2001, shortly after Giuffre&#8217;s night with the prince in London, where she accuses him of having sex with her at Maxwell&#8217;s home, she was allegedly &#8220;summoned&#8221; to the Big Apple by Epstein to meet the royal again, according to the book.</p>
<p>Maxwell allegedly placed her on the duke&#8217;s knee alongside another accuser, Johanna Sjoberg, a college student and Maxwell&#8217;s helper.</p>
<p>&#8220;This time their sexual encounter took place in Epstein&#8217;s massage room and in the presence of Ghislaine Maxwell,&#8221; according to the book.</p>
<p>Giuffre also claimed Andrew was grinning like &#8220;a kid going to Disney World&#8221; before the sexual encounter with her.</p>
<p>Maxwell told Giuffre to take the prince to the massage room where she rubbed him down in front of a 6-foot-tall painting depicting her in a sexual position with another girl, according to the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrew couldn&#8217;t have missed it,&#8221; Giuffre said, according to an account by reporter Sharon Churcher. &#8220;I was so embarrassed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The massage ended after she allegedly performed oral sex on Andrew while classical music played in the background, the book says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Spider&#8221; also reveals that Epstein enjoyed watching Giuffre get strangled by other women wearing leather studded collars and would dress her up as a German maid, a school girl or she&#8217;d wear tall boots during alleged romps with Maxwell.</p>
<p>During Giuffre&#8217;s first encounter with Epstein, Maxwell reportedly ordered the then-16-year-old to straddle Epstein, who then turned to her and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re such a good little girl,&#8221; according to the book.</p>
 
<p>Epstein, 66, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/10/convicted-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-dead/">committed suicide in his Manhattan jail cell</a> last year as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges</p>
<p>Maxwell, 58, is at the Brooklyn Detention Center awaiting trial after her <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/02/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-associate-arrested/">July 2 arrest</a> in New Hampshire on multiple charges, including transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and perjury.</p>

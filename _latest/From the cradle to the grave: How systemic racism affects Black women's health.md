<div><p class="Theme-Layer-BodyText-Dropcap">For more than 91 days, Danielle Bridges cared for her two children while dealing with <a href="https://www.today.com/health/knee-pain-symptoms-causes-treatment-relief-t150507">excruciating knee pain</a> after her doctor failed to treat her injury. Her knee was swollen and hot to the touch, an injury from taekwondo. She had gone to her in-network doctor, noticing her knee appeared filled with fluid and was unable to bend, but he <a href="https://www.today.com/health/dismissed-health-risk-being-woman-t153804">minimized her pain</a>. &#8220;The doctor even slapped me on the injured knee to prove it wasn&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; she said. Ultimately, she went home with crutches, no pain medication, no further tests and advice not to put too much weight on it. It wasn&#8217;t until about 3 months later that he finally did an MRI, she said. &#8220;Then, he called me sheepishly stating there was quite a bit of damage, including a torn ACL.&#8221;</p>
                    <p class>Bridges already had <a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-say-if-you-re-black-woman-your-doctor-won-t187769">anxiety regarding doctors and hospitals</a>. When she was pregnant with her first child, the OB-GYN she was seeing never looked her directly in her face, she said, and he insisted she must have known who the father of her child was even after she explained she used a sperm donor. She asked that a different doctor in the practice attend her child&#8217;s birth, and, ultimately, that doctor ignored her birth plan and all of her wishes. &#8220;She pushed me into induction and insisted I could not give birth naturally,&#8221; said Bridges. &#8220;It made me feel depressed and like I am not strong or capable. I am Black and pregnant with no father. Everything I wanted was pushed aside.&#8221;</p>

                    <p class>&#8220;It's really important that people understand the historical context behind why racism affects medicine,&#8221; Dr. Kiarra King, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, told TODAY. Citing J. Marion Sims, known as the father of gynecology, King explained that modern women&#8217;s health care was developed, without consent, on the bodies of Black women. <a href="https://www.today.com/health/racism-gynecology-dr-james-marion-sims-t185269">Sims experimented on enslaved Black women without pain medication</a>, and the idea that Black people feel less pain persists today.

Myths that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/16/4296">Black people have thicker skin</a> and feel less pain drive inadequate pain management where Black people reporting pain tend to be 22% less likely to be prescribed pain medications. </p>

                    <p class>These experiences are traumatic, but more importantly, they&#8217;re often fatal. One very shocking example of this disparity is breast cancer.

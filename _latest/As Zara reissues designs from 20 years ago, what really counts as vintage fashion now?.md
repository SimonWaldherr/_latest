  As Zara reissues designs from 20 years ago, what really counts as vintage fashion now? 
description: > 
  When you think about vintage shopping, you tend to picture triumphantly finding an Yves Saint Laurent blouse or a Mary Quant miniskirt in a second-hand shop - or at least in a stylish grandmother’s cupboard.What you don’t typically imagine doing is clicking on the Zara website and buying a dress from… 2012.But what counts as vintage clothing design changes fast - and today Zara released an archive collection that reissues 14 beloved pieces from 1996 to 2012.They may not be the brand’s best-sellers (those tend to be ribbed jumpers and pyjama tops) but they are well-designed items of clothing that - in the words of the Spanish retailer - are ‘a reinterpretation of Zara's past and a celebration of its present’.Lightly edited and re-imagined for today’s customer, the designs are well suited to the 2020 aesthetic - although interestingly, it is the pieces that hark back to the 1990s that feel most in-tune with current trends, rather than those reissued from the later end of the Noughties.

  Xiaomi's 80W wireless charger will get a phone from 0 to 100 percent battery in 19 minutes 
description: > 
  On Monday, China's Xiaomi announced its next generation, 80W wireless charging technology, which can charge a smartphone with a 4,000mAh battery from 0-100 percent in just 19 minutes.The video shows the phone getting charged from 0-10 percent in just one minute, and from 0-50 percent in just over eight minutes.Now, this isn't the fastest smartphone charging tech around; for example, Oppo's 125W charging tech is faster, as is iQOO's 120W charging technology, which gets a 4,000mAh phone fully charged in 15 minutes.However, Xiaomi's new charging tech is wireless, which is pretty much where the industry is going these days.There's no word on when we'll see smartphones with 80W wireless charging in stores.

<div><p>Slow wireless chargers are becoming a thing of the past.&#160;</p>
<p>On Monday, China's Xiaomi announced its next generation, 80W wireless charging technology, which can charge a smartphone with a 4,000mAh battery from 0-100 percent in just 19 minutes.&#160;</p>
<p>The company shared a video of this tech in action on a modified Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro smartphone.&#160;</p>
<p></p><p class="vplayer"></p><p>The video shows the phone getting charged from 0-10 percent in just one minute, and from 0-50 percent in just over eight minutes. An 80 percent charge level &#8211; which is typically plenty for one day's activities &#8211; is achieved in just over 14 minutes.&#160;</p>
<p>Now, this isn't the fastest smartphone charging tech around; for example, <a href="https://me.mashable.com/tech/10978/its-happening-phones-that-fully-charge-in-15-minutes">Oppo's 125W charging tech</a> is faster, as is iQOO's 120W charging technology, which gets a 4,000mAh phone fully charged in 15 minutes. However, Xiaomi's new charging tech is wireless, which is pretty much where the industry is going these days.&#160;</p>
<p>There's no word on when we'll see smartphones with 80W wireless charging in stores. If companies continue speeding it up, soon you'll be able to get a phone wirelessly, fully charged while you make your morning coffee.</p>

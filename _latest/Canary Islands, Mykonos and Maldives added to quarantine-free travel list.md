<p>Four destinations have been added to the Government&#8217;s travel corridors list, giving Britons a few more options for a last-minute quarantine-free autumn break.&#160;</p>
<p>The biggest addition as far as UK holidaymakers are concerned is the Canary Islands. While Spain remains on the red list, a far lower case rate in the Atlantic archipelago means Britons can now visit the likes of Tenerife and Lanzarote without needing to self-isolate on their return home.&#160;</p>
<p>Mykonos, the Maldives and Denmark were the other destinations given the green light. Mykonos is open to British tourists and its addition means the whole of Greece is now considered safe. The Maldives is welcoming tourists so long as they present evidence of a negative PCR test issued no more than 96 hours prior to departure. Denmark, however, is not permitting UK residents to enter unless they have a &#8220;worthy&#8221; reason &#8211; holidays, sadly, do not count.&#160;</p>
<p>One country, Liechtenstein, was removed, although it is already requiring all UK arrivals to self-isolate for 10 days.&#160;</p>
<p>The changes were announced by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps following the Government&#8217;s weekly review of its quarantine policy.&#160;</p>

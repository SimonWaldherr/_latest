Project Big Picture proposals include:

To help EFL clubs who have lost matchday revenue during the coronavirus crisis, £250m will be immediately sent to compensate them.

The nine-longest serving clubs will be given a special status when making major changes. And only six of those clubs will be required to give the green light; this includes amending rules and regulations, agreeing contracts and club ownerships.

The Premier League will be reduced from 20 teams to 18.

Two sides automatically relegated from the top-flight, while top two form the Championship are promoted. The club who finishes 16th in the Premier League will be put in a play-off with the third, fourth and fifth placed teams from the Championship.

The overall number of clubs in the professional game will be reduced from 92 to 90, with 24 clubs each competing in the Championship, League One and League Two.

The pandemic threw the real-estate world into disarray, as people emptied out of offices, hotels, and malls and worked from their homes. That disruption has transformed how people and companies finance, operate, and occupy real estate.

Some big firms have been rethinking office needs — and some commercial real-estate deals were put on ice as financing dries up. Coworking and flex-office firms are struggling under big rent obligations after years of rapid growth.

A surge in e-commerce, meanwhile, is fueling demand for warehouse and cold storage space as companies look for new ways to reach customers. Life-sciences companies are fueling a big boom in demand for lab space. And with the pandemic increasing the amount of food delivery and hurting restaurants' bottom lines, ghost kitchens see an opportunity to grow.

Still, companies like IBM and Facebook have been pushing ahead with plans for big office spaces, showing that it may be too soon to call and end to the office. Apple has been in talks to grow a Manhattan office that it leased earlier this year. And Amazon Music has signed on for 40,000 square feet in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to use as production and recording space.

Here's the latest news on how real-estate markets are being upended, and how experts think these markets will play out in the long run.

<ol><p class="slideData">1 of 5</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png"><p class="credit">David Zalubowski/Associated Press</p><p class=""><strong>The Trade:</strong> Denver Nuggets acquire Bradley Beal from the Washington Wizards for Michael Porter Jr., Gary Harris, No. 22 pick in the 2020 draft and a top-10 protected 2022 first-round pick.</p><p class="">The Denver Nuggets just made the conference finals, and they already have two players, Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, set to make an average of over $30 million over the next three seasons. Murray's deal actually has a fourth year on it that'll pay him $35.9 million in 2023-24.</p><p class="">This is no longer a team on the come-up. The Nuggets are&#160;here.</p><p class="">So while Michael Porter Jr., the centerpiece of this deal, has immense value because he projects to put up big scoring numbers on a cheap rookie deal, Denver might not want to wait on his development (particularly on D) when it could import a star veteran at a position of need.</p><p class="">Bradley Beal averaged 30.5 points per game last season, despite being the sole focus of every opposing defense. Imagine the improvement in shot quality he'd enjoy with Jokic spoon-feeding him several times a game and Murray commanding just as much of the opponent's attention.</p><p class="">The Nuggets will go into the 2020-21 season as a contender if they do nothing. Adding Beal could nudge them into the league's true top echelon&#8212;and they'd have their core entrenched for at least one more year, possibly two if Beal picks up his $37.2 million player option for 2022-23.</p><p class="">From Washington's perspective, this is a value play. John Wall's contract is immovable, and the team is not poised to compete in the near future. Beal is clearly the Wizards' best player, but he'll be toiling for a squad lucky to crack .500.</p><p class="">Porter is the lottery ticket here, a potential star on a team-friendly deal. Those two first-rounders may not seem like much given the weak crop of talent in 2020 and the protection on the 2022 pick, but they're more than enough to incentivize the Wizards to take on Gary Harris' contract.</p><p class="">And who knows, Harris might rediscover his past form and make for a quality running mate (who doesn't need the ball as much as Beal does) alongside a better-than-expected Wall.</p><p class="">The Wizards need a soft reset, and the Nuggets have to push their chips in. This deal ticks both boxes.</p></ol>

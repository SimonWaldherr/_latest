President Trump went to a church service in Las Vegas on Sunday morning and placed a handful of cash into the donation bucket, according to a report.

Pastor Paul Marc Goulet of the nondenominational International Church of Las Vegas hailed the president “because you just came to church,” the Las Vegas Review reported.

Trump, who worshipped with White House staffers Hope Hicks and Kayleigh McEnany, put a wad of $20 bills in the donation bucket marked “Change 4 Change.”

“This is your third time here, that means you’re a church member. I don’t care what anybody says. I love my president,” Goulet said.

Trump went to the church as a candidate in October 2016 and a year later as president following the mass shooting at a music festival.

“You’re doing a great job.” Goulet said, as he vowed to fast one day a week for Trump and his family through the Nov. 3 election.

Trump said it was “a great honor” to attend the service, adding “I love going to churches” and urging parishioners to “get out there on Nov. 3 or sooner” to vote.

Following the church service, Trump traveled to California for a fundraiser. Later Sunday, he will return to Nevada for a “Make America Great Again” rally in Carson City.

His challenger, Joe Biden, attended church services in Delaware before going to a drive-in rally at a high school in Durham, North Carolina.

Biden also took part in a virtual discussion with African American faith leaders from across the US.

“I happen to be a Roman Catholic,” the former vice president said. “I don’t pray for God to protect me. I pray to God to give me strength to see what other people are dealing with.”

Biden held up a rosary that he carries in his pocket, adding that the Irish call it “a prisoner’s rosary” because it’s small enough to be smuggled into prisons.

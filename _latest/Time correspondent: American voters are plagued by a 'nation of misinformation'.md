For instance, earlier this year he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/politics/fact-check-trump-absentee-versus-mail-ballots/index.html" target="_blank">railed against "mail-in voting" while defending "absentee voting,"</a> baffling experts who say those voting systems are essentially the same thing. The claims included some of his previously debunked claims about voter fraud. There is no widespread fraud in US elections.</p><p id="cnn-end-of-content" class="myFinance-widget"></p><a></a><p>And earlier this month, Trump retweeted a post from an account linked to QAnon that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/15/politics/donald-trump-osama-bin-laden-conspiracy-theory-fact-check/index.html" target="_blank">alleged</a> "Biden and Obama may have had Seal Team 6 killed," Osama Bin Laden was still alive, and that the man killed in the Obama-directed raid lead by Seal Team 6 was actually a body double.</p><a></a><p>In the early morning hours of May 2, 2011, Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/09/world/death-of-osama-bin-laden-fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank">was killed by US Special Forces during a raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan</a> . A DNA test was conducted, confirming it was bin Laden.

I test all the time. But I can tell you this, after the debate, I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive,&#8221; Trump said.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were required to tell the Commission on Presidential Debates that they tested negative prior to the debate on Sept. 29 &#8212; and will be asked to do the same for the final debate on Oct. 22, as per the commission&#8217;s rules.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Trump spent three nights at Walter Reed National Military Center after what the White House said were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-first-lady-test-positive-covid-19-n1241769">&#8220;mild symptoms&#8221;</a> from Covid-19.</p><p></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">But despite attempts from the president and his medical team to downplay the president&#8217;s condition, White House chief of staff <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/2020-10-03-trump-covid-n1241952/ncrd1242027">Mark Meadows told Fox News</a> while Trump was still hospitalized that &#8220;we were real concerned&#8221; because Trump &#8220;had a fever and his blood oxygen level dropped rapidly&#8221; on the day he was admitted to the hospital.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">After leaving the hospital, President Trump has said <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-declares-himself-immune-covid-19-his-doctors-won-t-n1242851">he&#8217;s &#8220;immune&#8221; </a>to the virus and that the medicines he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-returns-oval-office-despite-being-treated-coronavirus-n1242460">received were a &#8220;cure&#8221;. </a></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">However, scientists aren&#8217;t sure how long immunity may last in a person who recovered from Covid-19, and the U.S. already has its <a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/first-case-of-covid-19-reinfection-detected-in-the-us">first reinfection case</a>. Some of the medicines <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-receives-experimental-antibody-treatment-covid-19-diagnosis-n1241916">given to Trump</a>, like Regeneron, also haven&#8217;t received <a href="https://investor.regeneron.com/static-files/6feab76b-176d-402d-bf30-d40462e68b7b">emergency use authorizations</a> and are not being widely used as therapeutics for Covid-19.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Neither the White House physician nor the president have said exactly what symptoms were considered mild, however when asked by Guthrie if he had pneumonia, the president said no, but his lungs were &#8220;a bit different, a little bit perhaps infected.&#8221;</p><p></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">There&#8217;s a stark partisan divide in how much Americans trust the president&#8217;s statements on his health. Eighty-two percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners trust the president&#8217;s statements, while just 11 percent don&#8217;t. Meanwhile, 92 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners don&#8217;t trust the president, and only 3 percent do. A majority of independents &#8212; 59 percent &#8212; don&#8217;t trust the president, while 20 percent do and another 20 percent say they aren&#8217;t aware.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Trump&#8217;s general approval rating, as well as the approval of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/poll-trump-s-approval-rating-remains-stable-ahead-gop-convention-n1237877">has stayed stagnant</a> during months of NBC News|SurveyMonkey polling.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Forty-four percent of adults say they approve of both how Trump is handling his job and the government&#8217;s coronavirus response. Fifty-three percent say they disapprove of his job as president and 55 percent say they disapprove of his coronavirus response.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">By comparison, 58 percent of adults say they approve of their governor&#8217;s handling of the pandemic, with 40 percent disapproving.</p><p></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Data come from a set of <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/nbc-poll-covid-oct18" target="_blank">SurveyMonkey online polls</a> conducted October 12-18, 2020 among a national sample of 78,524 adults in the U.S. Respondents were selected from the more than 2 million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day.

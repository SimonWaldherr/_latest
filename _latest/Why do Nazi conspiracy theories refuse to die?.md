<div><p>Conspiracy theories appear to be a global phenomenon right now. From <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/07/darkest-corners-internet-qanon-reaches-white-house/">QAnon</a> supporters who believe that Satan-worshipping paedophiles are conspiring against Donald Trump, to those suggesting that Bill Gates invented Covid-19 to be able to microchip and control the world&#8217;s population, no theory is too absurd to gain traction on the internet, where &#8220;alternative facts&#8221; spread rapidly and are unfiltered.&#160;</p>
<p>Equally disturbing is the recent resurgence of distorted narratives about <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a> and the Nazis, writes Sir Richard Evans in his latest book, The Hitler Conspiracies. For Evans, emeritus regius professor of history at the University of Cambridge and author of numerous works on Germany, including a bestselling three-volume history of the Third Reich, the popularity of &#8220;fake news&#8221; about the Nazis demands an evidence-based intervention by professional historians. Evans, who served as one of the main expert witnesses in the trial that resulted in David Irving&#8217;s conviction as a &#8220;falsifier of history&#8221;, is ideally placed to take on the challenge of deconstructing fantastical narratives about the Third Reich.</p>
<p>One of the most enduring of these narratives is the theory that Hitler and his partner, Eva Braun, did not commit suicide in Berlin in&#160;1945, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Spread primarily by Nazi apologists who deny that Hitler chose suicide in the face of defeat, the legend goes that Hitler instead escaped to Argentina, which indeed became a post-war haven for many senior Nazis on the run, such as Josef Mengele and Adolf Eichmann. Hitler&#8217;s fictional escape to South America is the subject of countless books and even a hugely popular TV series, Hunting Hitler, which was broadcast on the History channel from 2015 to 2018.</p>
<p>As Evans points out in his timely new book, the series &#8211; like most popular books on the subject &#8211; completely ignores the hard evidence surrounding Hitler&#8217;s death and instead bases its story-line entirely on &#8220;innuendo, suggestion and invention&#8221;.&#160; Hitler&#8217;s &#8220;escape&#8221; to South America is one of five prominent conspiracy theories relating to the Nazis that Evans deconstructs in his book.</p>
<p>They include The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an early-20th-century &#8220;rambling, chaotic and unstructured&#8221; text designed to &#8220;prove&#8221; the existence of a clandestine Jewish conspiracy for world domination; the &#8220;stab-in-the-back&#8221; myth, which suggested Germany&#8217;s defeat in the First World War was the result of a betrayal by socialist revolutionaries rather than Allied military superiority; the claim that the Nazis caused the Reichstag fire in February 1933 in order to use it as an excuse to dismantle civil liberties; and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/17/day-1987-rudolf-hess-hitlers-right-hand-man-sole-prisoner-spandau/">Rudolf Hess</a>&#8217;s secret flight to Scotland in May 1941, often falsely depicted as a genuine offer of peace by Hitler and a missed opportunity to end the war.&#160;</p>

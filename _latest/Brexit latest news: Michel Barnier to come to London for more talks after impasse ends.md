<p>Michel Barnier is expected to come to London as early as tomorrow to resume full trade talks, after the two sides finally reached a breakthrough.&#160;</p>
<p>The Telegraph <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/michel-barnier-could-london-thursday-brexit-talks/">yesterday reported a face-to-face meeting was looking likely</a> after the EU negotiator promised to put everything on the table, including legal texts, which ministers have criticised him for withholding until now.&#160;</p>
<p>EU sources have today said that now seems likely, after Mr Barnier&#160;indicated the EU was willing to give ground.&#160;</p>
<p>"We will seek the necessary compromises on both sides in order to do our utmost to reach an agreement and we will do so right up until the last day which it's possible to do so," he said.</p>
<p>Downing Street had earlier&#160;noted "with interest" those&#160;comments which touched&#160;"in a significant way on the issues" that had stalled the troubled negotiations again this week.</p>
<p>The two chief negotiators - the EU's Michel Barnier and Britain's David Frost - had been due to discuss the issue by telephone from 3pm today.&#160;&#160;</p>

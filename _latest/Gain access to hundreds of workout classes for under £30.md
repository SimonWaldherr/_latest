TL;DR: A lifetime subscription to YFM Yoga, Fitness & Mindfulness is on sale for £23.20 as of Oct. 9, saving you 93% on list price.

While at-home fitness has been shaping our lives for decades — from Jane Fonda's exercise videos and the ThighMaster to P90X and Peloton — it's truly taken on a new life since the COVID-19 pandemic closed gyms across the country.

Everyone has been trying their damnedest to find ways to exercise effectively within their own four walls. If you have unlimited funds, go ahead and get a Peloton already. But for those who don't want to go broke from getting in shape, we've found a a great alternative on sale: a YFM Yoga, Fitness, Mindfulness subscription.

With lifetime access to online workouts, YFM helps you develop balanced, sustainable habits and establish a lifelong commitment to health, wellness, and growth. Workouts cover everything from yoga to kickboxing and meditation to HIIT, so there's something for literally everyone. There are currently hundreds of workout videos and courses available, but more are continuously being added. In other words, you'll always have new content to look forward to and you'll never get bored.

Whether you're looking to improve your flexibility, build strength, lose weight, decrease stress, or centre yourself, there's a class for that. Another bonus? The sense of community. Not only will the YFM instructors schedule a one-on-one call with you when you sign up to set goals and discover which courses will work best for you, but you'll be able to connect with other students, hold each other accountable, and celebrate milestones.

You can save an enormous 93% and get a lifetime subscription to YFM for only £23.20. That's less than a single month of using Peloton.

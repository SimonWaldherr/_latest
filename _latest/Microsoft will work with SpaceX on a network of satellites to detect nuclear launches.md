  Microsoft will work with SpaceX on a network of satellites to detect nuclear launches 
description: > 
  For the contract, SpaceX will build four experimental satellites that detect missile launches as part of the US Department of Defense's Space Tracking Layer network."Microsoft will be doing quite a bit of work as a subcontractor," Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of SpaceX, said in a video posted Tuesday.SpaceX has tapped Azure, a massive cloud-computing service built by Microsoft, to help it develop and operate experimental satellites capable of detecting missile launches all over the world.SpaceX plans to seamlessly link Microsoft's new devices through Starlink, the rocket company's growing fleet of internet-beaming satellites.A representative for Microsoft acknowledged Business Insider's query but did not immediately provide more details about Azure's role in the effort.

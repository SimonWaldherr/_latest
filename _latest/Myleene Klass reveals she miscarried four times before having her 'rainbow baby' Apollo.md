Myleene Klass has emotionally revealed she is a 'mama to seven babies' after she miscarried four times, before having her 'rainbow baby' Apollo, 14 months.

The presenter, 42, took to Instagram on Thursday to share her experience on National Baby Loss Miscarriage Day after Chrissy Teigen, who lost her baby Jack halfway through her pregnancy last month, gave 'me the courage to write'.

Alongside two photos showing off her bump during her pregnancies, Myleene said: 'I am Mama to 7 babies, Ava, Hero, Apollo my rainbow baby and 4 little stars in the sky.

'I know after my own MC's (miscarriages) how I scoured the internet for stories similar to mine for peace, reassurance.

'I hope this helps even one lost soul.'

Myleene said she suffered her first miscarriage when she was at the airport, flying home for a dilation and curettage procedure, which is often performed after a first-trimester miscarriage.

She explained: 'I'd started bleeding heavily at 10wks on holiday. The scan was the saddest sight I've ever seen in my life. The first and last time I saw my baby.

Her story: Myleene said: 'I am Mama to 7 babies, Ava, Hero, Apollo my rainbow baby and 4 little stars in the sky' (pictured with her children and fiancé Simon Motson)

Devastating: The presenter accompanied the post with pictures of when she was pregnant

Speaking out: The presenter took to Instagram to share her experience on National Babyloss Miscarriage Day

'As the doctor pushed the camera on my belly, the familiar black and blue image of my baby sprung onto the screen, then started to sink and slowly floated down, til it just hunched over. I knew.

"I'm sorry there's no heartbeat".

Myleene said she was asked to confirm the procedure, but 'cried so hard', a nurse had to answer on her behalf.

Support: Myleene thanked Amanda Holden, who lost her son Theo while pregnant, for 'keeping her together' other the past few years

Not alone: Chrissy Teigen, who lost her baby Jack halfway through her pregnancy last month, gave Myleene the 'courage to write'

'The feeling is nothing short of traumatic, shock,' she said.

'They taped my bracelet to my wrist, two gold swallows. It made me sob. Swallows love for life and always come home.

'I told the anaesthetist to please make sure I wake up as I'm a mum then I cried again at what they were going to take out. I woke to emptiness and the horror of what had happened.

'I felt I'd failed my baby and my partner.'

Motherhood: The former HearSay singer said she 'felt I'd failed my baby and my partner' when she suffered her first miscarriage, before eventually falling pregnant with Apollo (pictured)

Putting on a brave face: The star explained how she injected herself with 'countless, endless hormones into my belly to keep my placenta working' while she was pregnant with Apollo

Baby joy: Myleene alluded to her trauma in this post in August last year: 'Will never get over or take for granted the miracle of growing and carrying a child! (and yes, I’m STILL pregnant!)'

Myleene described her second miscarriage as 'worse if that's possible'. Feeling like she already had her '1 in 4' experience.

The former HearSay star said her baby stopped growing at ten weeks, but for reasons completely unrelated to her first miscarriage.

Reliving the trauma, Myleene said: 'I didn't take my eyes off the fire alarm on the ceiling, lest I break completely. Walking past the pregnant women in reception was torture.

'This D&C was no less traumatic. In fact, the familiarity of it cut deeper.

'The "wishes to dispose of the products of pregnancy" form, the walking to theatre, the ugly socks. Having everything one minute, a name, a school, then nothing.

Traumatising: 'The third, I miscarried at work. The fourth, the loo. Whilst I could get pregnant, there was no explanation for why I couldn't keep them,' she told fans

'The third, I miscarried at work. The fourth, the loo. Whilst I could get pregnant, there was no explanation for why I couldn't keep them.'

When Myleene became pregnant with her gorgeous son Apollo, doctors 'took no chances'.

The Dancing On Ice contestant explained how she injected herself with 'countless, endless hormones into my belly to keep my placenta working.'

Speaking of her rainbow baby, Myleene said: 'He signifies everything good in the world to me, my miracle. To my friends and Mamas who have experienced this, you are the strongest women I know. Thinking of you today'.

Alongside Apollo, Myleene is proud mum to Ava, 12, and Hero, eight, whom she shares with her ex-husband Graham Quinn.

Last month, the presenter announced her engagement with her long term partner Simon Motson.

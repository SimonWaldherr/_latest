<div><p>Marge Champion, a dancer-actress in Golden Age movies, Broadway musicals and television shows, has died. She was 101.</p>
<p>Champion, who was the real-life model for Disney&#8217;s animated Snow White and won an Emmy for choreographing the 1975 telefilm &#8220;Queen of the Stardust Ballroom,&#8221; died Wednesday in Los Angeles, dance instructor Pierre Dulaine <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marge-champion-dead-actress-dancer-model-snow-white-was-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.</a></p>
<p>Marjorie Celeste Belcher was born on Sept. 2, 1919. Her father was noted Hollywood dance teacher Ernest Belcher, who taught Fred Astaire and Shirley Temple &#8212; and was friends with Walt Disney. This led to the animation team working on 1937&#8217;s &#8220;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&#8221; studying her movements on a soundstage in order to make their animated leading lady move realistically on screen.</p>
<p>Starting at 14 years old, she danced for the all-male team a couple days a month &#8212; at 10 bucks a day &#8212; for two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of them had been a young girl or knew how a dress would do this or that or the other thing,&#8221; she <a href="https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/marge-champion#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a 1998 interview</a> with the Archive of American Television. &#8220;Most of the animators [before then] took their characters &#8230; out of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>She later served as Disney&#8217;s model for the Blue Fairy in 1940&#8217;s &#8220;Pinocchio,&#8221; Hyacinth Hippo in 1940&#8217;s &#8220;Fantasia&#8221; and Mr. Stock in 1941&#8217;s &#8220;Dumbo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marge and her famed husband/dance partner Gower Champion &#8212; also a student of her father&#8217;s &#8212; were married from 1947 until they divorced in 1973. He died in 1980 at 61.</p>
<p>She and Gower co-starred in several MGM musicals, including George Sidney&#8217;s 1951 remake of &#8220;Show Boat,&#8221; with Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson and Ava Gardner. They went on to appear in a films with Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Bing Crosby.</p>
 
<p>The 5-foot-2-inch dancer made her Broadway debut in 1945&#8217;s &#8220;The Fair Witch in Dark of the Moon.&#8221; Rechristened &#8220;Marjorie Bell,&#8221; she formed an act with her new husband called Gower &amp; Bell, playing nightclubs and co-starring with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;The Admiral Broadway Revue.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the summer of 1957, the pair headlined &#8220;The Marge and Gower Champion Show.&#8221; &#8220;Each of the Champions&#8217; dances tells a story,&#8221; a TV critic once wrote according to THR, &#8220;and virtually every leap, every move, every gesture tells part of that story.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pair also choreographed Broadway musicals, including the original production of &#8220;Hello, Dolly!,&#8221; starring Carol Channing, which premiered in 1964 and ran through 1975.</p>
<p>Marge wed her last husband, TV director Boris Sagal, in 1977. He died in 1981 from injuries suffered when he accidentally walked into a helicopter blade on the set of the NBC miniseries &#8220;World War III.&#8221;</p>
<p>Survivors include a step-daughter, actress Katey Sagal (&#8220;Sons of Anarchy&#8221;), and her son, producer-director Gregg Champion. She also had two other step-daughters, twins Liz and Jean Sagal (stars of the 1980s sitcom &#8220;Double Trouble&#8221;), and stepson Joey, an actor.</p>

Whether you're interested in watching Tom Brady whip the pigskin in his new Florida digs, checking out how professional football looks in Las Vegas, or you happen to be a fool like me still holding out hopes that the Detroit Lions can win a Super Bowl (cue the uproarious and hurtful laughter), you can use at least one of the methods outlined below to watch the 2020 NFL season.

With that said, the right NFL streaming option for you will vary depending on your fandom priorities. Basically, the games are spread across five primary networks: ESPN, NBC, Fox, CBS, and the NFL Network. Your location also determines which games get aired on your local stations. Additionally, you can stream all your local in-market games on your mobile device for free using the Yahoo Sports app or the NFL app.

To help ensure you get access to all the games you'd like to watch, we've broken down the ins and outs of watching the NFL without a cable subscription.

How to watch live NFL games without cable

The 2020-21 NFL season began on September 10 with a Thursday night game between the Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs on NBC. Subsequent games are being spread across different channels, and there are several options available to stream each network.

Sunday afternoon games with an NFC home team are being aired on Fox, and Sunday afternoon games with an AFC home team are shown on CBS. Meanwhile, Sunday Night Football airs on NBC, and regular Thursday Night Football is broadcast on NFL Network all season long. Thursday Night Football will also be shown on Fox and streamed via Amazon Prime or Twitch starting week five through the end of the season. Finally, Monday Night Football is on ESPN.

You can access many of these channels without a cable subscription via several streaming services, like Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, FuboTV, YouTube TV, CBS All Access, and NFL Sunday Ticket. Additionally, some services offer NFL RedZone as an add-on for fans who want to watch all the best action from across the league simultaneously rather than sit through one game. If you want to watch games on your local stations without cable, you can also opt for an HDTV antenna.

Depending on the service, you can stream through smart TVs, game consoles, and streaming devices, like Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV. Some platforms can also be streamed on-the-go via smartphones, laptops, and tablets.

Week 5 NFL games to look out for

Week five of the 2020-21 NFL season kicks off with a Thursday Night Football game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Chicago Bears. With Nick Foles now starting for Chicago, we get a rematch between the two quarterbacks who faced off, albeit with two different teams, in Super Bowl LII.

After Thursday night's game, there are some scheduling issues due to the coronavirus outbreak within the Tennessee Titans organization. Several players and personnel have tested positive as of October 8, so it's likely that the Titans game against the Buffalo Bills will be pushed back to Monday or Tuesday. Additionally, the reigning defensive player of the year, New England's Stephon Gilmore, also tested positive for the coronavirus, creating a potential week five delay for the Patriots' matchup against the Denver Broncos.

Beyond scheduling uncertainty, there are still some noteworthy games happening across the league in week five. Coming off a big win on Sunday night against San Francisco, the Philadelphia Eagles have another tough matchup against Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Another game to watch is the Sunday night matchup between the Seattle Seahawks, led by early-season MVP favorite Russell Wilson, and the Minnesota Vikings, who bounced back after an 0-3 start with a win against Houston in week four.

Here's a full roundup of all the services you can use to stream NFL games without cable.

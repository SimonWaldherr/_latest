  Muslim doctor who refused to shake woman's hand is denied German citizenship 
description: > 
  A Muslim doctor has been denied German citizenship after refusing to shake a woman's hand when she gave him his certificate.But he failed at the final hurdle after refusing to shake the hand of the female official at the ceremony in 2015, leading state authorities to deny him citizenship.'If the applicant refuses to shake hands for gender-specific reasons which are incompatible with the constitution, there is no integration into German living conditions,' they said.'This applies in particular if the refusal to shake hands with the opposite sex - as in this case - serves to further a Salafist conviction about the relationship between men and women.'The man's refusal to shake hands with the official came from a belief that women posed a 'threat of sexual temptation', the court said.

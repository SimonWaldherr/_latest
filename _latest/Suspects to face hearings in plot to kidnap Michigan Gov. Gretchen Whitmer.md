Five men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will appear in federal court Tuesday for a hearing on whether they should be held before facing trial.

Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta will appear before US Magistrate Judge Sally Berens in Grand Rapids. A sixth suspect, Barry Croft, is being held in Delaware.

Last week, the FBI made arrests using confidential sources, undercover agents and secret recordings to foil the alleged kidnapping conspiracy.

Some of the suspects had conducted coordinated surveillance of the Democratic governor’s vacation home in August and September, according to a criminal complaint.

The men were trying to retaliate against Whitmer due to her “uncontrolled power” amid the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said.

Fox, who was described as one of the leaders, was living in the basement of a vacuum shop in Grand Rapids whose owner said the suspect was opposed to wearing a mask and kept firearms and ammo at the store.

Seven other men linked to a shadowy paramilitary group called the Wolverine Watchmen have been charged in state court for allegedly seeking to storm the state Capitol and providing material support for terrorist acts by seeking a “civil war.”

Those seven suspects are Shawn Fix, 38, Eric Molitor, 36, Pete Musico, 42, Joseph Morrison, 26, Michael Null, 38, William Null, 38, and Paul Bellar, 21.

In all, 13 men were arrested in the alleged plot.

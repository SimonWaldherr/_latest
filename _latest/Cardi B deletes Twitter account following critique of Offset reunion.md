<div><p>Cardi B has <a href="https://twitter.com/iamcardib?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deleted her Twitter</a> account.</p>
<p>The rapper, 28, took to Instagram &#8212; where <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her account</a>, which has over 77 million followers, is still live &#8212; on Saturday to explain her decision to leave the other social media platform. Primarily, she said in her rant on Instagram Live, she was upset at critique of her <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/15/cardi-b-back-with-offset-explains-herself-on-instagram-live/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent reunion with rapper Offset</a>, who she filed for divorce from last month, and generally with being told what&#8217;s best for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so tired that because of y&#8217;all I&#8217;ve gotta continuously explain myself,&#8221; she said in the video, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9468084/cardi-b-twitter-deleted" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Billboard reported</a>, adding that she&#8217;s not even the one who made her own divorce public, yet she has to deal with the fallout over it. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t put my divorce out there, a f&#8212;ing court clerk put it out there. And because people are making rumors up, &#8216;Oh, this guy has a girl pregnant,&#8217; this and that, I have to address it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite followers having a field day over the reunion, Cardi said it&#8217;s actually one of the last things on her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Offset is not the only f&#8211;king problem that I deal with,&#8221; Cardi said. &#8220;To be honest with you, my marriage is one of the least worries that I have right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She maintains hope the pair may work their relationship out and prove haters wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys want to be harassing this n&#8212;-. Bro, if I work things out, why are you going to this n&#8212;-&#8216;s Twitter to harass him? That s&#8212; don&#8217;t make no f&#8212;ing sense,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I love my fans and I&#8217;m thankful and I&#8217;m grateful for everything you do, but some of you really be acting like I sleep with ya.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being inundated with unrequested advice makes her feel like a Disney Channel star.</p>
<p>&#8220;A whole bunch of 15-year-olds telling me how to live my life like I&#8217;m mother&#8212;-ing Ariana Grande or something,&#8221; Cardi said, &#8220;like I came from Disney or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other social media woes this month, Cardi also <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/10/13/cardi-b-speaks-out-after-accidentally-posting-topless-photo-to-instagram/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accidentally posted</a> a topless photo to Instagram.</p>

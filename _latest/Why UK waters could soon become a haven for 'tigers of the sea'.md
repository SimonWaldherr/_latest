<div><p>When surfers in Cornwall saw a huge, iridescent bluefin tuna rising from the water almost in touching distance, they screamed with delight.</p>
<p>This sight is becoming more common in British waters due to climate change, conservationists say - and they are asking for the endangered fish to be protected.</p>
<p>Currently, EU countries which have a bluefin tuna quota,&#160;including Spain and France, can hunt the fish in British waters due to a loophole - when the rules were created, they so rarely ventured this far north that there was no point making our seas exempt. British fishermen are not allowed to catch and sell the fish.</p>
<p>Now, there are calls to make our waters a sanctuary for the "tigers of the sea", which are persecuted everywhere they swim due to the high price of tuna flesh. One large bluefin can sell at auction for over&#160;&#163;1 million - but the stunning predator is at risk of extinction.</p>
<p>Senior Government sources told The Telegraph&#160;they "absolutely love"&#160;this idea for when Britain leaves the EU and that they are looking into making our waters a haven for the rare animals.</p>
<p>Megan Hemsworth, a surfer who took the amazing shot, told The Telegraph:&#160; "I was shooting on the land with a zoom lens, the tuna jumped out and all the girls surfing were just&#160;screaming with delight and taking it in, I got back on the camera and luckily it did jump again so I got the shot. All the girls in our group of surfers who saw it jumping&#160;in front of the group were blown away by how large the fish was."</p>

As the temperatures drop, these rugged, hard-wearing jackets and tops, based on designs that have been honed over centuries, are perfect as a top layer – and easy to pull off when the sun does decide to come out.

French workers’ jackets by brands such as Le Laboureur and Vetra may be sold in fashion boutiques, but they sit just as happily in gardening shops such as Great Dixter’s.

Indeed it’s the adoption of these durable, practical staples by head gardeners such as Fergus Garrett or TV gardeners like Monty Don that has fuelled their popularity, whether layered with chunky knits in winter or worn over light T-shirts or shirts in autumn and spring. Niwaki’s new handmade and limited-edition Kojima work jacket takes this fetish for utilitarian staples to new heights, with its 12oz Japanese denim and slight stretch.

Variations on the labourer’s smock are just as versatile, with their roomy pockets and loose fit – and have also boomed thanks to stylish influencers, such as The Land Gardeners, making it their go-to kit. There’s no reason not to plunder chandlers for the sailor’s version of these, which often have the pockets inside rather than outside.

All of them are made in sturdy fabrics – cotton twill or sailcloth – and they will look their best when worn, washed and faded by years of use.

Facebook pushed adverts linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory into its users’ feeds as many as 2.4m times this spring and summer, profiting from the movement and helping it grow even as employees investigated its potential for ­violence.

The social media giant first removed a network of fake accounts seeking to spread QAnon’s beliefs in April this year, and finally banned all QAnon groups, pages and Instagram accounts from its services last week.

However, between those two points, Facebook’s online advertising archive shows that it approved at least 204 adverts using the hashtags, symbols or slogans of the movement, which has been a key incubator of coronavirus denialism, as well as violent attacks and plots.

The adverts, seen as many as 2.4m times, ranged from online merchants seeking to capitalise on the phenomenon with branded T-shirts, through ardent believers organising marches, to a Lithuanian addiction counsellor and hypnotherapist who described coronavirus as a Satanic plot to control the world. Some of the adverts were bought by candidates running for office in the US, while one advertiser selling QAnon-branded T-shirts, which managed to briefly bypass Facebook’s advertiser verification checks, paid for its promotion with rubles.

The real number of adverts and views is likely to be higher because The Daily Telegraph’s survey only included those using clear terms associated with QAnon, and could not catch any that might have eluded Facebook’s security checks by falsely classifying themselves as non-political. Nevertheless, the figures shed new light on QAnon’s rapid dissemination to potentially millions of people across Facebook’s services, propelled by sharing within private groups and the company’s own recommendation algorithms.

A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment beyond pointing to the succession of ever-tightening restrictions it has imposed on the movement since August. He added that the company had made an error by approving the adverts paid for in rubles.

QAnon is a loose, fractious movement devoted to the theory that a huge number of celebrities and politicians belong to a secret Satanist cabal that kidnaps children in order to abuse them and consume their blood in the form of a psychoactive drug.

Adherents believe that US president Donald Trump is engaged in a secret war against this conspiracy, and look forward to an imminent moment of national transformation in which his political opponents are rounded up or executed en masse.

Rafael Nadal’s mastery on the clay continued Sunday in the French Open final.

Nadal dominated Novak Djokovic in straight sets, 6-0, 6-2, 7-5, to win the men’s 2020 French Open title, giving him his 20th career grand slam victory, tying him with Roger Federer for the most men’s majors ever.

The 34-year-old Nadal now has 13 French Open championships.

The match was so lopsided at first that in the second set, John McEnroe said on the NBC broadcast, “This isn’t even a match. I can’t believe what I’m seeing.” But Djokovic finally put up a fight in the third set, taking a 5-4 lead. But Nadal held serve and then broke Djokovic to go up 6-5 before serving out for the win.

“Today you showed you are the king of the clay,” Djokovic said to Nadal in an on-court interview after the match.

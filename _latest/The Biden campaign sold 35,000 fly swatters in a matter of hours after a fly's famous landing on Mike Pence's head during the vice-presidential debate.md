The Biden campaign sold 35,000 fly swatters within hours this week after moving swiftly to capitalize on one of the most buzzed-about moments of the vice-presidential debate, Bloomberg reported.

The swatters, which sold for $10 each, carried the slogan "Truth Over Flies" in a play on the Biden campaign's slogan, "Truth Over Lies."

The swatters' slogan was a reference to a fly that landed on Vice President Mike Pence's head for two minutes during the debate on Wednesday evening. The fly immediately became a social-media sensation and was trending for hours after the event.

Later that night, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tweeted a picture of himself holding a fly swatter that was originally posted on his Facebook page in October 2019.

Biden has maintained a lead in polls nationally ahead of the November 3 election.

President Donald Trump now finds himself trailing in several battleground states that helped him win the White House in 2016, including Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

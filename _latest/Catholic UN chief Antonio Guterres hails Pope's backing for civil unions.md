<div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The UN's Catholic secretary-general has praised the Pope's historic comments in support of same-sex civil unions after the pontiff said gay people were 'children of God and have a right to a family'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UN chief Antonio Guterres, a devout worshipper from Catholic Portugal, said the papal thumbs-up was 'extremely welcome' after Francis's words sparked cheers from gay Catholics and outrage from <a href="/news/conservatives/index.html" id="mol-c390d8b0-1449-11eb-8f32-07c6f4ec33ee">conservatives</a>.&#160; &#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is a clear demonstration of a fundamental principle, which is the principle of nondiscrimination,' said Guterres in New York.&#160;'And one of the things that has been very clear in the UN doctrine on this is that non-discrimination is also relevant in the questions of sexual orientation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So this is decision of the Pope is, of course, extremely welcome from our perspective.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Francis's comments emerged in a new documentary in which he said that 'what we have to create is a civil union law', a position at odds with previous Vatican dogma.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Francis, 83, opposes gay marriage, his words were hailed by admirers as a 'major step forward in the church's support for LGBT people'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, there was also a chorus of anger from conservative Catholics who said it 'clearly contradicts what has been the long-standing teaching of the church'.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="vjs-video-container vjs-fixed vjs-span-two-col news" id="v-9008115991929666959">    </p> <img id="i-607d56ef529777d3"

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Catholic teaching holds that gay people should be treated with respect but that homosexual acts are 'intrinsically disordered'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 2003 document from the Vatican's doctrine office - bearing the stamp of Francis's two immediate predecessors - said legal approval would mean the 'approval of deviant behaviour'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Church teaches that respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behaviour or to legal recognition of homosexual unions,' it said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The common good requires that laws recognise, promote and protect marriage as the basis of the family, the primary unit of society.'&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also argued that Catholic lawmakers had a 'moral duty' to vote against the legal recognition of same-sex unions.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The document was approved by Pope John Paul II and signed by Francis's predecessor, the future Pope Benedict XVI.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Francis supported civil unions when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, but his words carry a far greater weight as head of the Catholic Church.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He made his comments in a new documentary, Francesco, by Oscar-nominated director Evgeny Afineevsky.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Homosexual people have a right to be in a family. They are children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or be made miserable over it,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered. I stood up for that,' he said.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Rev James Martin, a prominent Jesuit priest who has advocated for greater LGBTQ inclusion in the church, called the remarks momentous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'First, he is saying them as Pope, not Archbishop of Buenos Aires,' Martin said. 'Second, he is clearly supporting, not simply tolerating, civil unions. Third, he is saying it on camera, not privately.

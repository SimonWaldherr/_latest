  The final debate could be Trump's last chance to turn the race around: He's already attacking the moderator 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON – The next (and final debate) isn't until Thursday, but President Donald Trump is already trying to pressure and intimidate the moderator, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker."She’s always been terrible & unfair, just like most of the Fake News reporters, but I’ll still play the game," Trump tweeted Saturday.Thursday's debate is crucial for Trump, who refused to participate in an Oct. 15 showdown with Biden because organizers wanted a virtual debate in light of the president's COVID-19 diagnosis.Despite his recent attacks, many people have praised Welker's reporting during the Trump administration – including Trump himself."I think she's going to do an excellent job as the moderator for the third debate.

  Wacky tube man could keep dingoes from killing cattle in Australia, study finds 
description: > 
  Forget about scarecrows - Australian farmers hoping to save their livestock from dingos might want to borrow a wacky tube man from their local used car dealer.So scientists in Adelaide tested out a tube man to keep dingos away from a bowl of dog food.Nine of the twelves dingoes ran away after laying eyes on the tube man, compared with only one that bolted after hearing the sound of gunshots.Farmers have tried nonlethal approaches before but the dogs quickly adaptEach wind-blown tube man requires about 1000 watts to power, about the same as a dishwasher.Smith was actually inspired to try out Fred after hearing about conservationist Suzanne Stone, who used a wacky tube man to scare off wolves from a ranch in Oregon.

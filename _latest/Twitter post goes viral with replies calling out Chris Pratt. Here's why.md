description: > 
  If you've been on Twitter on Monday or over the weekend, you might have noticed a certain celebrity trending high: Chris Pratt.Much of the conversation stems from a tweet shared Saturday by filmmaker Amy Berg that asked users which Hollywood Chris they would get rid of out of a lineup between Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pine and Chris Evans."Chris Pratt because he’s MAGA.He’s the worst Chris," user @DrChaeEd wrote in a retweet of the post, despite Pratt not publicity endorsing any 2020 presidential candidate."Well, seeing as three of them are progressive, and one of them actively defends his church for being homophobic... Bye, Chris Pratt," user @jeffbrutlag tweeted.

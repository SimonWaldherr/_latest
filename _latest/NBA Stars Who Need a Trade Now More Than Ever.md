  NBA Stars Who Need a Trade Now More Than Ever 
description: > 
  "I could see them trading him to a team this [offseason] if he agrees to pick up his option.Drummond has a $28.8 million player option for the 2020-21 season, money he almost certainly wouldn't see from any other team in free agency.For a two-time All-Star who just led the NBA in rebounding for the fourth time in five years, that seems like way too long to wait.That doesn't mean Drummond should be pushing for a trade right this minute, of course.That gives rival executives a chance to evaluate where they stand financially and competitively."

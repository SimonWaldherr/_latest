Harry Maguire is a doubt for Manchester United’s Premier League trip to Newcastle on Saturday, with the defender suffering from a knock picked up shortly before being sent-off while on England duty.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer backed the 27-year-old to bounce back from his recent struggles, which included a red card on Wednesday in the 1-0 defeat by Denmark and a nightmare performance in the 6-1 loss to Tottenham a fortnight ago.

The issues come after Maguire was arrested in Greece during the summer, i what has become a well-documented saga as he appeals convictions for bribery, aggravated assault and resisting arrest.

There have been growing calls for Maguire to be given a rest to clear his head, with former United captain Rio Ferdinand calling for Solskjaer to “take him out of the over”, and the Norwegian revealed on Friday that Maguire may miss this weekend’s Premier League resumption regardless of any decision to leave him out of the squad.

"When Harry is part of the England team that beats number-one ranked Belgium, that's just a normal day and then you get the headlines when you get the sending-off. That's just football for you,” Solskjaer said.

"There's so many ups and downs that we have got to deal with it, individually and as a group.

"Harry's got great resilience. I know he'll bounce back. I'll know that he wants to play, he wants to just work his way out of the last couple of games that he's been criticised (for).

"He picked up a knock against (Denmark) just before he came off, so I'm just hopeful he'll be fit. We've had a look at him yesterday and will give him a test again today."

Solskjaer may feel he cannot afford to drop Maguire to allow him a break due to United’s struggles this season, having taken just three points from their opening three Premier League games after losses to Crystal Palace and Spurs. With the Champions League also due to begin next week, the games continue to come thick and fast, but Maguire is far from the only player under pressure to perform.

The 6-1 defeat by Spurs triggered concerns that all may not be well at Old Trafford, with United currently 16th in the Premier League table, although reports of a rift between Solskjaer and Fernandes during that defeat were dismissed by the Portuguese midfielder.

"It's one of those things that you have to get over as soon as you can and move on," Solskjaer said. "We know any little chance from outside ... you want to create a division.

"I think Bruno (Fernandes) spoke really well the other day about how we are united, we have to stay together. We can't listen to everyone outside. We've got to just get on with it.

"Bruno's now lost two league games since he came to the club and he came in February, but it's been two in quick succession.

"So, he's not used to losing league games for us but now, Bruno, welcome to Man United - this is what happens when you lost a couple, they're going to try to create a division between us.

"But that's not going to happen because this group is a group that wants to work hard together, stick together."

Selection-wise, Solskjaer is still unable to call on new signing Edinson Cavani, who agreed to join as a free agent on deadline day but has not yet completed his quarantine period to feature. Left-back Alex Telles is available after joining from Porto although his delayed arrival due to international duty could see him miss Saturday’s encounter, while Facundo Pellistri, the 18-year-old winger signed from Uruguayan side Penarol, has already impressed his manager.

"We're looking forward to integrating them into the group," he said. "Facundo, he's been in training with us now two days. Very exciting, young enthusiastic player with some attributes that we don't have. Of course he's one maybe more for the future, maybe not for just now because he's still 18.

"Alex came in yesterday, did his recovery after a long, long flight from Sao Paulo, having come on twice for Brazil so we're looking forward to integrating him.

"Edinson has still not been with the group because of his quarantine, so all three of them have got something different to what we have and they'll definitely come in and help us.

BTS brought "the fire and set the night alight" all over again at the Billboard Music Awards. This year's award show was different given the pandemic but the Korean pop band turned their performance of their latest hit 'Dynamite' into a grand spectacle. It certainly isn't their first time performing the song but they have definitely outdone themselves this time.

RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook took over Incheon Airport dressed to the nines in co-ordinated red suits (each tailored to match their unique styles) to perform 'Dynamite'. The idol group was joined by a live band that played remotely and could be seen on the screens behind the band members. The set was complete with brass instruments including a trumpet and saxophone. This jazzed-up version of the song was enough to take the spotlight but there was so much more at play here. The setting was transformed into a perfect stage that literally lit up in a burst of colours. A fan captured the performance that aired on NBC and put it up on YouTube, check it out here:

Over the past few weeks, we have watched several versions of 'Dynamite' like the stand out a cappella video we got from The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon during BTS Week. 'Dynamite' is the gift that keeps on giving. At the Billboard Music Awards, BTS received nods for the Top Duo/Group category and the Top Social Artist category which they won for the fourth time in a row. The award season has been great for BTS with the band getting top nods at the MTV VMAs and EMAs. BTS is also the first South Korean act to climb right on top of Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. More recently, BTS claimed the top spot on the chart with their remix of 'Savage Love' pushing ‘Dynamite’ to the second spot making history…again!

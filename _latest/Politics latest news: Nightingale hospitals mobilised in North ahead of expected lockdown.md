Boris Johnson's new three-tiered system of lockdown is intended to get the virus under control before Christmas, a Cabinet minister said today.

The Prime Minister will set out the traffic lights system in the House of Commons at 3:30pm this afternoon, followed by a press conference at 6pm, where he is expected to confirm a raft of new restrictions that will come into force from Wednesday afternoon.

Speaking this morning Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, said: "The purpose of doing this is to ensure we get the virus under control so by the time that we get through to after Christmas we are in that position where it is under control," he added. "Indeed I hope it will be sooner than that."

Ahead of the Prime Minister, deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam and NHS boss Steve Powis warned about the steep rises already being seen around the country.

Prof Powis said as a result, Nightingale Hospitals in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate have put on standby.

Demi Lovato's ex-fiance Max Ehrich released an emotional new ballad called Afraid this Friday along with a music video.

The spare, socially distanced video shows Max, 29, showing off his toned arms in a sleeveless top while accompanying himself on the piano.

'I'm afraid to love you, love you, afraid to give it my all,' he belts while sitting alone at his instrument in a dark room with projections flashing across the back wall.

The way they were: He and Demi got engaged in July after going into lockdown together but by last month it emerged they have split

Showing off his astonishing vocal skills he continues: 'I'm afraid to love you, love you, love with you with my whole heart.'

He sings that he is gripped with fear of having to 'give up my heart' and 'lose against love' or 'to be overthrown' and wind up 'alone.'

Max croons that the woman he is singing to is 'so amazing - smile so sweet, makes honey taste bitter. You're so beautiful.'

However he has 'been broken so many times' and is scared he might 'disappoint' his paramour and being left 'with a big hole in my heart.'

Trepidation: He sings that he is gripped with fear of having to 'give up my heart' and 'lose against love' or 'to be overthrown' and wind up 'alone'

The heartthrob declares himself 'afraid of bruising' and 'afraid to be broken apart,' noting that 'I've been broken so many times' in the past.

'So I play, I play safe, holding my guard,' he confesses, adding: 'There is more to give and enjoy. I wanna throw up all the ropes.'

Max plays and sings against a backdrop of shifting projections that include the Earth in rotation as well as birds flying at sunset and a city view at night.

He and Demi went into lockdown together amid the coronavirus pandemic and revealed this July that they had gotten engaged.

'You're so difficult: Max croons that the woman he is singing to is 'so amazing - smile so sweet, makes honey taste bitter'

However: He has 'been broken so many times' and is scared he might 'disappoint' his paramour and being left 'with a big hole in my heart'

However last month it emerged that they had broken their engagement, and while he claimed to have found out about the split 'through a tabloid,' a People source said Demi made sure to inform him of her decision beforehand.

There were rumors that the split was partially influenced by resurfaced alleged social media comments Max is claimed to have made before dating Demi.

In the screen-grabs, which Demi has said are fake, Max purportedly expressed his attraction to her onetime best friend Selena Gomez.

Days after breaking her engagement Demi dropped her own single called Still Have Me which was widely rumored to be about the Max split.

'I'm a mess and I'm still broken but I'm finding my way back, and it feels like someone's stolen all the light I ever had,' she sang on the track.

Demi's song prompted Max to say on social media that 'I was used' and snipe: 'I hope your single gets to number one.'

This past weekend he was spotted looking heartbroken at the beach where he proposed to Demi, and early this week an E! News source claimed that 'she is having all sorts of issues with Max not leaving her alone.'

The insider alleged: 'He has been trying to get in contact with her family and friends and they have all blocked him. She's in contact with lawyers now on what to do.'

However this Tuesday night he was seen in a photo obtained by E! News enjoying an evening out with American Idol alum Sonika Vaid.

They two were quite close together when they were glimpsed strolling side by side down a sidewalk in Los Angeles after dark.

'I met Max recently at dinner with mutual friends. It was a fun night and we all got to hang out and head to the studio together,' Sonika explained to E! News.

  Football fans and blood balloons: how Aaron Sorkin recreated the 1968 Chicago riots 
description: > 
  The most dramatic moments in Aaron Sorkin’s new film, which covers the trial of the leaders of the anti-war protests outside the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, were always going to be the flashbacks.These plunge the audience back into the protests themselves, in which protesters clashed with riot police and the city descended into violence.“It’s still going on – life hasn’t changed,” the film’s producer, Stuart Besser, tells me over the phone from the States.“That’s the thing that’s so moving to me, and so sad.“Everything that’s out there today was there then," says Besser, pointing out that much like their 2020 counterparts, the 1968 protesters carried signs demanding women's rights and civil rights.

<div><p>The most dramatic moments in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/aaron-sorkin-stars-must-speak-without-voice-interview/">Aaron Sorkin</a>&#8217;s new film, which covers the trial of the leaders of the anti-war protests outside the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, were always going to be the flashbacks.&#160;</p>
<p>These plunge the audience back into&#160;the protests themselves, in which protesters clashed with riot police and the city descended into violence. But when Sorkin, his cast and crew went to Chicago to shoot the scenes last year, they had no idea how powerful the political turmoil of 2020 would render them by the time of the film&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still going on &#8211; life hasn&#8217;t changed,&#8221; the film&#8217;s producer, Stuart Besser, tells me over the phone from the States. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s so moving to me, and so sad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything that&#8217;s out there today was there then," says Besser, pointing out that much like their 2020 counterparts, the 1968 protesters carried signs demanding women's rights and civil rights. "When you see it still happening, as a parent it&#8217;s like, &#8216;When will we get it? When will this be right?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

A leading Republican congressman demanded Thursday that the FBI reveal whether it’s investigating allegations of “potential criminal activity” by the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

In a two-page letter, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) called on FBI Director Christopher Wray to write back regarding what he called the “explosive report” released by Republican senators on Wednesday.

“Among other findings, the report documented ‘potential criminal activity relating to transactions among and between Hunter Biden, his family, and his associates with Ukrainian, Russian, Kazakh, and Chinese nationals,’ ” he wrote.

Jordan also said the 87-page report from Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) “shows that the FBI has been aware of some alleged misconduct for years.”

“The FBI suffered from a pattern of misconduct and politicization at the highest levels of the FBI during the Obama-Biden Administration,” he wrote.

“The new revelations in Chairman Johnson’s and Chairman Grassley’s report only add more concern about the FBI’s actions.”

Jordan asked whether the bureau was investigating Hunter Biden’s alleged “receipt of $3.5 million from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow” and his alleged “payment of ‘thousands of dollars to individuals involved in human trafficking and prostitution,” among other things.

A lawyer for Hunter Biden on Wednesday told the Washington Post that Hunter Biden had no financial interest in, and was “not a co-founder of,” the Rosemont Seneca Thornton investment firm that allegedly received the wire transfer from Elena Baturina, Russia’s richest woman.

Lawyer George Mesires did not return a request for comment from The Post regarding the report’s allegation that his client “sent funds” to women who then wired money to people in Russia and Ukraine who “are linked to what ‘appears to be an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.'”

The FBI acknowledged receiving Jordan’s letter but declined to comment further.

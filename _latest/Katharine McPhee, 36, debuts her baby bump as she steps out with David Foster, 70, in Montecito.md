They're expecting their first child together after tying the knot in June 2019.

And Katharine McPhee looked radiant as she showed off her blossoming baby bump for the first time in a long-sleeved black top and leggings on Tuesday.

The actress, 36, appeared to be in good spirits as she went baby shopping while out for lunch with her husband David Foster, 70, in Montecito, California.

Katharine kept things casual for the outing, donning comfortable sportswear which covered her growing stomach.

She kept her accessories to a minimum, but did don some sunglasses and a face mask as well as wearing her cute dog in a light grey sling across her body.

The brunette beauty tied her long tresses back into a low ponytail and added a navy blue baseball cap to complete her ensemble.

David also cut a relaxed figure in light denim jeans and a t-shirt, with the record producer opting to match his wife with a similar choice of hat.

While mom-to-be Katharine passed the time by browsing baby stores, leaving The Nurture Cottage with a large white shopping bag full of purchases.

MailOnline has contacted Katharine's representatives for comment.

It comes after the couple enjoyed a cosy double date with Prince Harry and Meghan on Tuesday night to celebrate the news over dinner in Montecito, California.

The couple were married at the Armenian Church of St Yeghiche in South Kensington, London, on June 28 last year.

This is the first child for Katharine and the sixth for David Foster, 70.

News that the 36-year-old actress is pregnant with the 70-year-old record producer's child was confirmed by People's sources on Thursday.

Foster has five daughters and has been married five times: to B.J. Cook, Rebecca Dyer, Linda Thompson, Yolanda Hadid and McPhee.

His first child, Allison Jones Foster, 50, was born when David was just 20-years-old and was subsequently placed for adoption, with the Grammy winner reconnecting with her 30 years later.

Foster's first marriage to singer-writer Cook produced a daughter named Amy Skylark, 47, while his second marriage, to Dyer, produced daughters Sara, 39, Erin, 38, and Jordan, 34.

McPhee was previously married to Nick Cokas from 2008 - 2016.

It was revealed back in August that David and Katharine were 'definitely trying' to have a baby, according to Us Weekly's sources.

David's daughters Sara and Erin previously told the outlet that they 'fully expect [McPhee] to have a child and fully support [that]'.

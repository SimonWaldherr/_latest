  Republicans Set to Advance Barrett Nomination Amid Democratic Boycott 
description: > 
  Democrats were particularly angry that Republicans had reversed themselves since 2016, when they refused to consider President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee nine months before the election that year.Republicans intended to proceed anyway, even if it meant tossing out Judiciary Committee rules that required members of the minority party to be present to conduct official business.“Judge Barrett deserves a vote, and she will receive a vote,” Mr. Graham said late Wednesday.“Judge Barrett deserves to be reported out of committee, and she will be reported out of committee.Judge Barrett deserves to be on the Supreme Court, and she will be confirmed.”

    <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Republicans have moved at breakneck speed to jam through this nominee, ignoring her troubling record and unprecedented evasions, and breaking longstanding committee rules to set tomorrow&#8217;s vote,&#8221; Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement on Wednesday. &#8220;We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just 12 days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Democrats planned to hold a news conference on the steps of the Capitol galvanizing opposition to the process. Left in their places in the hearing room will be large posters of Americans whose health care coverage they argue could evaporate if Judge Barrett were to side with a conservative majority on the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act when it hears a Republican <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/supreme-court-obamacare-appeal.html" title="">challenge to the law</a> next month.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Republicans intended to proceed anyway, even if it meant tossing out Judiciary Committee rules that required members of the minority party to be present to conduct official business. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the committee, argued this week that broader Senate rules only require a simple majority of all committee members be present.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;Judge Barrett deserves a vote, and she will receive a vote,&#8221; Mr. Graham said late Wednesday. &#8220;Judge Barrett deserves to be reported out of committee, and she will be reported out of committee.

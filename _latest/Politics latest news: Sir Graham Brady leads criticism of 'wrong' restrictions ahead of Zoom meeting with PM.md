Senior backbench Tories have attacked Boris Johnson's restrictions for creating a "half alive state".

The chair of the 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady, told the Commons that the principle must be to "protect as much of peoples' freedom as possible ", and pointed to options such as exempting children from rule of six, getting rid of pub curfew and introducing testing at airports as ways this could be done.

He added: "I make no bones about it, in my view it is wrong to use public health legislation designed to control infected people to direct the lives of an entire population. This half alive state cannot be allowed to be made permanent."

Steve Baker also raised concerns about the cost of the measures, reliant on cheap credit, which he said left the country in a "precarious" state in the likely event of inflation.

The former minister also praised the Great Barrington Declaration - something which Matt Hancock criticised for wrongly championing herd immunity.

It is understood that Boris Johnson will take part in a special meeting of the 1922 this evening, as he looks to win over the veteran critics.

However it seems likely that Labour will abstain rather than vote against the Government, meaning any rebellion would be symbolic rather than meaningful.

description: > 
  The Senate judiciary committee voted Thursday to advance Amy Coney Barrett’s supreme court nomination to the full Senate as Republicans powered past Democrats’ boycott of the session.Never has the Senate confirmed a supreme court nominee so close to a presidential election.The Republicans, who hold the majority, voted in favor of Barrett, a conservative judge.“Barrett deserves to be on the supreme court and she will be confirmed,” said the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, the committee chairman.The 48-year-old federal judge’s ascent to the high court would lock a 6-3 conservative majority on the court for the foreseeable future.

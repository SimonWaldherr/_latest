<div><p>The team behind the animation short film Shehr-e-Tabassum, is about to release another short film titled Swipe by the end of this month.</p>

<p>Puffball Studio has made a name for itself by using animation storytelling to tackle some of the key issues faced by Pakistan. They are calling this collection of work &#8216;cyberkhilafat&#8217;.</p>

<p>Cyberkhilafat is genre of film set in a hostile, fascist society where the nexus of technology, religion, and authoritarianism dictates political, economic, and social norms while circumscribing individual identities and everyday life. This genre explores how the weaponization of religious rhetoric isolates and dehumanizes communities, corrupts language and ideas, and perpetuates cycles of violence.</p>

<p><a href="/animation/755/shehr-e-tabassum-a-short-animation-feature-film-with-an-orwellian-touch">Shehr-e-Tabassum</a> was the first film, a dystopian film which explored freedom of expression in a futuristic Pakistan.</p>

<p class="vplayer"></p>

<p>Swipe is a hand drawn Urdu animation in which the story unfolds in Multan, a city hooked to iFatwa. It is an app that crowdsources fatwas, giving users the option to swipe right for wajib-ul-qatal, left for maafi for cases submitted by the public. iFatwa has taken the city by storm, with adults and children alike compete to be on the app&#8217;s Ajar Board. The short film is an exploration of the corruption of love, honour and faith through dehumanizing technology and fundamentalist interpretations of religion.</p>

<p>According to <a href="/short-films/1585/in-conversation-with-arafat-mazhar-the-man-behind-shehr-e-tabassum">Arafat Mazhar</a>, the founder of Puffball Studio and Director of the film, &#8220;It&#8217;s perhaps one of the most urgent stories we have wanted to tell and are excited to finally put it out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time around in addition to the teaser of the film, throughout the month of September the team has been sharing via their social media conceptual film posters, music and also the first look for the film and the iFatwa app.</p>

<p class="vplayer"></p>

<p>They set the bar really high with the first film and we are waiting to see what they have in store for us with the upcoming Swipe.</p>

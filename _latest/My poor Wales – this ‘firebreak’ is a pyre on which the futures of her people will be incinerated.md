<div><p>At least in the North West and the North East we have witnessed some resistance to the tyranny of twp. The leader of Hartlepool Borough Council said yesterday that if ministers tried to put his region into Tier 3 <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/20/boris-johnson-manchester-tier-3-lockdown-brexit-news-latest/">&#8220;they&#8217;ll be told to sod off&#8221;</a>. That&#8217;s the spirit! Twp-face Hancock must be stopped. Meanwhile, Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, accused the government of selective use of NHS numbers to frighten local people into lockdown. Spot on. And at a time when evidence is emerging that the second ripples of the epidemic are already abating.</p>
<p>Poor Wales. The &#8220;firebreak&#8221; is not a safety measure;&#160;it&#8217;s a pyre on which the futures of her people will be incinerated. I grieve for my country, I really do. Most of all, though, I&#8217;d like seeing my mum not to be a crime.</p>

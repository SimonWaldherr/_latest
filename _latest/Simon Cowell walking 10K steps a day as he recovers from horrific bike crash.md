Simon Cowell is having daily physio sessions and walking 10,000 steps a day as he recovers from the horrific bike crash that saw him nearly paralyzed, friends say.

The TV star has been resting at his Malibu home alongside girlfriend Lauren Silverman and son Eric and a source close to the acerbic Brit denied reports that he was set to be bedridden for months on end.

He celebrated his 61st birthday at home on Wednesday and took calls from friends in the UK, according to his pal and “Britain’s Got Talent” co-star Amanda Holden.

Holden said this week that he’s getting around-the-clock care, adding: “He’s doing well. I keep in touch with Lauren every week.

“His will and determination to get himself better is inspiring.”

She added that being with Lauren and Eric is also motivating Simon to focus on getting back on his feet.

A source close to the star told Page Six said that Cowell has already been out of his back brace, adding: “Simon’s having little or no visitors due to COVID, but he’s doing 10,000 steps a day and swimming regularly.

“It’s become a ongoing joke that Lauren has to run to keep up with him.”

Cowell broke his back in three places — coming within an inch of cutting his spine and facing possible paralysis — while showing off his fancy new $20,000 high-powered e-bike to 6-year-old Eric, and 14-year-old stepson, Adam, outside his Malibu compound in August.

Following a grueling six-hour surgery, the star tweeted: “Some good advice . . . If you buy an electric trail bike, read the manual before you ride it for the first time.”

While recovering, Cowell has still been forced to miss “America’s Got Talent.” Viewers were also hoping to see him make an appearance in the “BGT” finale on Saturday night in the UK, but were left disappointed, as the friend said: “We talked about it, but he wasn’t up to it.”

Doctors told Cowell it was too early to return to work.

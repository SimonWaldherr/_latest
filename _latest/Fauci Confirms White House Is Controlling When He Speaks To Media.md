<p>Fauci, who is notoriously apolitical, has been growing more visibly frustrated as the president continues to undermine him and other public health experts on safety protocols and potential treatments throughout the pandemic &#8213; even after the president himself tested positive for the virus following multiple superspreader events.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anthony-fauci-says-he-didnt-consent-to-trump-ad_n_5f8350bcc5b62f97bac4426f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Trump campaign released a new ad last week</a> featuring what appeared to be Fauci praising Trump&#8217;s response to the pandemic. The ad features a video clip of an interview the doctor gave on Fox News in March, when the pandemic was beginning to lead to lockdowns across the country.<br></p><p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine that &#8230; anybody could be doing more,&#8221; Fauci is heard saying right after the video&#8217;s narrator praises the president&#8217;s response to the pandemic. The doctor said his words were taken out of context &#8213; which he reiterated in Sunday&#8217;s interview &#8213; <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fauci-trump-campaign-take-down-ad_n_5f84cc17c5b6e6d033a659b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and demanded the ad be taken down</a>, but the Trump campaign continued to run it in key battleground states.</p><p>&#8220;I do not and nor will I ever publicly endorse any political candidate. And here I am, they&#8217;re sticking me right in the middle of a campaign ad, which I thought was outrageous,&#8221; Fauci said. &#8220;I was referring to something entirely different. I was referring to the grueling work of the task force that, &#8216;God, we were knocking ourselves out seven days a week. I don&#8217;t think we could have possibly have done any more than that.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Did the steam start to come out of your ears?&#8221; LaPook asked the doctor.</p><p>&#8220;It did, quite frankly,&#8221; Fauci answered. &#8220;I got really ticked off.&#8221;</p><p id="inline-newsletter_placeholder"></p>

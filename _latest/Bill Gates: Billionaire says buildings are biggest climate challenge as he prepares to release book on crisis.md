description: > 
  Buildings will be the most difficult innovation challenge of the climate crisis, Bill Gates has said.The Microsoft founder made the prediction during a “fireside chat” at the GeekWire Summit last week.Fortunately, innovation, although it's hard to predict, across about 10 different areas, if we have those innovations, we can do very well," Mr Gates said.In his GatesNotes blog on Monday, Mr Gates announced the release of his new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, slated for February 2021.The book will be a culmination of his 10 years of studying climate change with experts and investing in innovations, he wrote.

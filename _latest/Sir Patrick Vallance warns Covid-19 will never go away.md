<p class="mol-para-with-font">But, he said, any vaccine at all is not likely to come in 2020.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You might be able to tell from the way I've spoken very often that I do think we should not over-promise,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think it's very important that we give a realistic picture of where things are'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'I've been clear right from January [I thought it would be] unlikely that we'd have vaccines for any sort of widespread use in the community before at least spring next year.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Patrick explained that even this rate of developing a vaccine is 'extraordinary'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'If you think about the previous history of vaccines the average time it's taken to make a vaccine from scratch is about 10 years and it's never been done before in under about five years, at the very quickest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're now in an extraordinary situation where there are at least eight vaccines that are in quite large clinical studies around the world, some of which will start to read out from their end stage clinical studies over the next few months so we will know, I think, over the next few months whether we have any vaccines that really do protect and how long they protect for.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Patrick's warning came as Britain&#160;recorded another 18,804 <a href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-ff17ce20-123c-11eb-9823-0fd66347f048">Covid-19</a> cases and 80 deaths as both infections and fatalities continue to creep upwards.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Department of Health statistics show the daily number of infections has risen 34.6 per cent in a week, up from the 13,972 cases declared last Monday. But the scale of the second wave is still a far-cry from the darkest days of the spring, when at least 100,000 Britons were catching the virus every day.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Government data also shows deaths have risen again, up from the 50 laboratory-confirmed fatalities posted last week. Mondays are always affected by a recording lag that means dozens of victims are not added to the tally until later in the week.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And coronavirus-related hospital admissions in Britain leapt up to 988 on October 15, the most recent day figures are available for, up from 676 last Monday. For comparison, they had dropped below 100 during the summer and were as high as 3,500 at the end of March and start of April.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wales today announced a 'circuit breaker' lockdown, with bars, restaurants and non-essential shops facing closure for a fortnight. Labour's First Minister Mark Drakeford said the draconian move will take effect from 6pm on Friday and argued&#160;that failure to act now would mean 'more people will die'.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tories criticised the draconian move, claiming that it doomed Wales to an endless cycle of two-week lockdowns and calling the 'fire-breaker' a 'blunt instrument'. They also lashed out at Mr Drakeford, accusing him of 'small man syndrome'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the move will heap pressure on Boris Johnson who has been desperately resisting the option in England despite backing from his own SAGE experts. Northern Ireland and Scotland have already introduce their own national crackdowns amid spiking cases, but the PM has been sticking to his plan for local 'Tiers'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The further rise in confirmed infections in the last 24 hours takes the UK's rolling seven-day average number of daily infections as high as 17,649, up 21 per cent from last Monday's 14,588.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The country's weekly infection rate is estimated to be around 185 cases per 100,000 people, although this varies widely by region.

Despite the trials being suspended on Wednesday, its developers and Number 10 remain confident that the vaccine could be ready for use either at the end of this year or early next year. They say a pause is common in trials, and that its development was also stopped in July after a suspected side-effect was detected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How does it work?: The vaccine works by exposing participants to a weakened common cold adenovirus which has had proteins from the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 attached to its surface. The idea is that the exposure allows the immune system to build an immune response, meaning they are protected if they are infected by the real virus.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Has the UK secured doses?: Yes, 100 million. The US has secured a further 300 million doses, along with several other countries. These will be rolled out in an equitable manner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How much does it cost?:&#160;AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University, has said it will not profit from the it, but may earn extra royalties if the coronavirus becomes an endemic infection like flu.

The vaccine is being developed by a German company in partnership with American drugmaker Pfizer. It is recruiting 30,000 volunteers to its stage three trials.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How does it work?:&#160;This is an RNA vaccine, a type that has never been approved by regulators before. It will involve injecting a fragment of genetic material from coronavirus into participants. This will expose their immune systems to a weakened version of the virus and, hopefully, trigger a response which will protect them from the real virus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Has the UK secured doses?: Yes, 30 million doses. The US has also ordered 100 million doses.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Price?: The US is paying $2 billion (&#163;1.5 billion) for its doses, or about $20 (&#163;15) a jab.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Moderna, US</p><img id="i-9a1861aea6e9cd28" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="189" width="284" alt="Moderna vaccine entered human trials" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-9a1861aea6e9cd28" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/09/10/16/33016102-8717791-image-a-17_1599750926500.jpg" height="189" width="284" alt="Moderna vaccine entered human trials" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p class="imageCaption">Moderna vaccine entered human trials</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When will it be ready?: Very end of this year or next year.

The Russian medical research institute and Russian defence ministry have developed this vaccine. But it has faced serious criticism both inside and outside Russia because results from its human trials are yet to be published. It also hasn't cleared large human trials, with researchers only launching one involving 40,000 volunteers on 26 August. Scientists say the vaccine has been rushed without proper checks, and could pose a risk to those taking it. The Kremlin began appealing for volunteers for the vaccine this week after a first batch was produced, according to the TASS news agency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How does it work?: The Russian vaccine works by carrying a piece of the coronavirus genetic code into a participant via another virus.

The vaccine entered final-stage trials in Brazil in July, and then in Indonesia in August. Results show that while younger and middle-aged people produced antibodies, older people had a weaker immune response. The vaccine was given emergency approval for limited use in July, reports suggest, although it appears to still be subject to testing. It was previously reported as being second only to the Oxford vaccine, but its complete test results are yet to be published. It is one of four vaccine candidates in development in China.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How does it work?: It involves injecting patients with an inactivated form of the virus, prompting their immune systems to develop a response.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Has the UK secured doses?: Unknown.

The rate in Newcastle stands at 371.5, down from 553.8 in the same period.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although some of the country's major cities are seeing infections tumble, the towns and boroughs around them are starting to see the steep increases, which may explain the Government's keenness to lockdown in more areas.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But experts have previously accused the Government of 'jumping the gun' with local lockdowns and not giving earlier-imposed measures enough time to take effect.&#160;</p><img id="i-9203aa91c75000bc" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="430" width="633" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-9203aa91c75000bc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/23/34582138-8856233-image-a-5_1603145851369.jpg" height="430" width="633" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p></p> <p></p><p class="imageCaption"></p><img id="i-e57462d5772c8653" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="295" width="633" alt="Manchester's current rate is 432.5, after peaking at 583.5 in the seven days to October 3, raising doubts about whether ministers' plans to impose the harshest lockdown measures there are really justified" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-e57462d5772c8653" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/21/34579764-8856233-Manchester_s_current_rate_is_432_5_after_peaking_at_583_5_in_the-a-9_1603139049273.jpg" height="295" width="633" alt="Manchester's current rate is 432.5, after peaking at 583.5 in the seven days to October 3, raising doubts about whether ministers' plans to impose the harshest lockdown measures there are really justified" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p></p> <p></p><p class="imageCaption">Manchester's current rate is 432.5, after peaking at 583.5 in the seven days to October 3, raising doubts about whether ministers' plans to impose the harshest lockdown measures there are really justified</p><img id="i-9e075c4ab490453b" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="290" width="635" alt="In Nottingham the rolling weekly rate of cases peaked at 1,001.2 per 100,000 people for the seven days to October 8 - the highest in England - but since then the number has been falling, currently standing at 787.6" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-9e075c4ab490453b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/21/34579768-8856233-In_Nottingham_the_rolling_weekly_rate_of_cases_peaked_at_1_001_2-a-8_1603139049271.jpg" height="290" width="635" alt="In Nottingham the rolling weekly rate of cases peaked at 1,001.2 per 100,000 people for the seven days to October 8 - the highest in England - but since then the number has been falling, currently standing at 787.6" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p></p> <p></p><p class="imageCaption">In Nottingham the rolling weekly rate of cases peaked at 1,001.2 per 100,000 people for the seven days to October 8 - the highest in England - but since then the number has been falling, currently standing at 787.6</p><img id="i-a50266c8432b23de" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="293" width="635" alt="Meanwhile, the figures show Sheffield's rate is 396.7, down from a high of 500.3 in the seven days to October 7" class="blkBorder img-share">  <img id="i-a50266c8432b23de" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/19/21/34579766-8856233-Meanwhile_the_figures_show_Sheffield_s_rate_is_396_7_down_from_a-a-10_1603139049291.jpg" height="293" width="635" alt="Meanwhile, the figures show Sheffield's rate is 396.7, down from a high of 500.3 in the seven days to October 7" class="blkBorder img-share">  <p></p> <p></p><p class="imageCaption">Meanwhile, the figures show Sheffield's rate is 396.7, down from a high of 500.3 in the seven days to October 7</p><img id="i-aeb5d09da30ebd4a" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="298" width="635" alt="The rate in Newcastle stands at 371.5, down from 553.8 in the same period.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Other cities with large student populations, including Exeter, Leeds and Liverpool - Britain's first 'Tier Three' lockdown city - have also seen case rates fall in recent days.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The figures, from Public Health England, suggest the rapid spread of Covid-19 among areas with a high density of student accommodation appears to have halted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By contrast the places in England recording the biggest growth in case rates are no longer big cities but a mixture of towns and suburbs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Areas with the largest week-on-week increase in the latest seven-day rates include Gedling, north-east of Nottingham (up from 216.3 to 385.9); Blackburn with Darwen (up from 357.4 to 482.3); Barnsley (up from 225.2 to 348.8); and Blackpool (up from 220.9 to 326.3).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The largely rural borough of Charnwood in Leicestershire, which includes the town of Loughborough - home of Loughborough University - has seen its rate rise from 153.9 to 288.9.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One city - Bristol - has seen a notable jump in the latest figures, but its rate is still far below those recorded by the likes of Nottingham and Manchester in recent weeks, standing at 205.9 up from 99.9.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall the numbers suggest the geographical hotspots for Covid-19 in England may have tilted away from big cities and towards built-up areas that do not necessarily have densely-housed student populations - and that the virus is now being spread increasingly through community infections rather than circulating largely within student accommodation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes as Manchester's Mayor Andy Burnham has been sent an ultimatum by Government ministers saying he must agree to a Tier Three lockdown today after days of wrangling.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Labour mayor of the region has so far refused to accept the tightest lockdown rules for his residents, arguing that they will devastate local businesses and that they are being unfairly imposed in the North of England.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he now faces a decision between bringing them in on his own terms of having Downing Street force a lockdown on the area, which includes Manchester city, Oldham, Bolton, Trafford, Bury, Salford, Tameside, Stockport, Rochdale and Wigan.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The mayor and local MPs say there is no evidence going into the strictest lockdown would actually bring down cases and point to data which appears to suggest the outbreak in Greater Manchester is slowing, as evidence not to shut down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manchester city is the only area in Greater Manchester seeing daily infections drop, but outbreaks in Trafford, Stockport and Oldham have also stabilised,&#160;Public Health England figures. And the&#160;rate at which cases are rising in the other nine boroughs has began to decelerate.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, Bury was reporting an average 108 cases per day by October 12, up from 97 daily cases the week prior, an increase of&#160;11 per cent.&#160;This is down significantly from the rise between September 28 and October 5, when daily cases jumped 33 per cent from 73 to 97.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A similar trend has played out in the other boroughs. In Wigan, the rolling seven day average number of daily cases is 205 - which is up nine per cent compared the seven days prior. For comparison, this figure almost doubled from September 28, when it was 99.3, to October 5's 188.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rochdale's is currently recording 149 cases per day, up by 16 per cent the week before, when it was 128. The week-on-week rise then was much smaller than the increase between September 28 and October 5, when daily cases jumped 59 per cent from 86 to 128.&#160;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although case numbers are still up week on week - and way above the national average in every borough - they are being used as evidence not to go into a Tier Three lockdown.</p><img id="i-47617307e502a74a"

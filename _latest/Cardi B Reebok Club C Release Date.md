In the past few years, the relationships between artists and brands have slowly started to get more intimate. Reebok, being one of the biggest players in such a shift, have not only recruited long-time family member Kerby Jean-Raymond to their creative team but also have celebrated the birthday of newfound member Cardi B with her very own take on the iconic Club C silhouette.

Revealed by the artist on her birthday, 10/10, the collaboration is soon to officially kick off come November — the date likely to include more than just the aforementioned. Sat on blue rugs and posed in front of a jewel-encrusted washer/dryer combo, Cardi dons her boldly reimagined Club C: an interpretation that overdesigns the model past the point of being recognizable. Soles are reminiscent of boots in their bulky and stacked construction, while the upper leans into similar exaggeration as it bears a see-through window right behind the gold-dressed Reebok insignia. Further touches of luxury hit the logos behind at the black-colored hele tab and the puffed tongue, while everything adjacent seems to be relatively low profile as they shape in white neutrals.

Grab a detailed look at Cardi’s Club C here and find them available now in women’s and toddler sizes on Reebok.com through exclusive access. A wider release will be taking place next month on November 13th.

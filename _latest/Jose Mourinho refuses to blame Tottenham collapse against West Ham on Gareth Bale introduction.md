  Jose Mourinho refuses to blame Tottenham collapse against West Ham on Gareth Bale introduction 
description: > 
  Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho did not think the introduction of Gareth Bale was the catalyst for his side's late capitulation against West Ham."Don't think so, honestly don't think so," he said.The focus was on the game and he was on the bench for 65 minutes or so and I don't think so, I don't think at all."I think you can imagine how frustrated I am and how frustrated the players are, but that's football," Mourinho said.When you get something from nowhere it gives you emotions and I think that's why we are in it.

"The decision not to start him was I think a good decision. A decision to show that he doesn't have a beautiful chair waiting for him in the team and he sits there the first time he can.</p><p id="taboola-carousel-thumbnails"></p><p>"It was a message to the team that in this team everybody has to fight for positions.</p><p>"He's very well accepted in the group. Everyone likes him, and I believe he also likes what he found here. So everything is positive and the focus was not on him. The focus was on the game and he was on the bench for 65 minutes or so and I don't think so, I don't think at all.</p><p>"It's a pity that he couldn't score that fourth goal, which was a beauty and would have killed the game.

But after that we got a grip and controlled the game. I thought the players did really well throughout the game.</p><p>"It is one of these moments you don't get very often, we scored the last three goals in the last 10 minutes.</p><p>"I saw my celebrations back and all the players are laughing at me jumping up and down, it felt like a David Pleat moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is what football is for.

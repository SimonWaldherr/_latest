Lancashire will be going in Tier 3 this weekend, after a last-ditch deal was agreed with the Government with an extra £12m funding package.

On top of this initial support, the Government has pledged an extra £30 million to help with the local test, trace and isolate and will create a ministerial-led taskforce with additional funding to work with Lancashire leaders to support local businesses to recover over the coming six months.

Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said: “An unrelenting rise in cases in Lancashire means we must act now, and we have worked intensively with local leaders to agree on additional restrictions.

“I know how heavy these additional challenges will weigh on everyday life for the people of Lancashire – but they are critical in bringing this virus under control."

Lancashire will become the second part of England, after the Liverpool City Region, to go into the highest category as the battle over Greater Manchester continues.

Sir Richard Leese told Sky News that discussions were cancelled last night and have not been rescheduled today, saying there was a "very high chance" that they would be battling throughout the weekend.

He told BBC they were " in a bit of a vacuum" in terms of information, but said they were "ready and willing to meet at any time".

Meanwhile Dominic Raab accused Andy Burnham of "holding Government over a barrel", as he threatened to use "reserve powers" to force the region into the highest category of restrictions.

The Foreign Secretary claimed the Greater Manchester Mayor was "pulling up the drawbridge" and urged him to "do the right thing by the people of Manchester".

Boris Johnson is expected to hold a press conference this afternoon.

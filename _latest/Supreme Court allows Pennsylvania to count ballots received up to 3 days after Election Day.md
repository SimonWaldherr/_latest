  Supreme Court allows Pennsylvania to count ballots received up to 3 days after Election Day 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON â€“ The Supreme Court ruled Monday that absentee ballots in Pennsylvania can be received up to three days beyond Election Day, setting a precedent that could apply to some other states as well.Because of the 4-4 tie, the lower court ruling by the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court stands and that court had ruled in favor of a three-day extension.State Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also said the date should be extended, and the state Supreme Court agreed.Democrats countered that because of the state court ruling, officials already have advised voters that ballots can be received until Friday, Nov. 6."Their argument would almost certainly invalidate multiple state election laws on the eve of the election," Clifford Levine, the state Democratic Party's attorney, said in court papers.

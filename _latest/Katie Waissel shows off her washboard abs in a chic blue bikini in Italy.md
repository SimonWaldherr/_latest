She transformed her lifestyle and dropped two stone with a gruelling exercise plan after welcoming her first child in 2018.

And Katie Waissel showed off the fruits of her labour as she slipped into a blue bikini for a dip in the pool during an Italian getaway on Friday.

The former X Factor star, 34, looked sensational as her swimwear put her washboard abs and slender figure on full display as she enjoyed a relaxing day at her luxury resort.

Katie paired a button-up bikini top with thong bottoms that sat high on her waist and accentuated her slender legs.

She pulled her brunette locks into a messy ponytail, and she embraced her natural beauty by deciding to go make-up free for the pool day.

Completing her look, Katie shielded her eyes with a pair of chic shades and she made sure to keep up with her health stats by wearing an Apple watch.

Last month, Katie showed off her toned physique in a candid Instagram post where she discussed the importance of finding time to train her body as a single mother.

The star looked incredible in simple grey Calvin Klein lingerie as she documented her postpartum fitness journey, stating: 'I didn't have my son and then wake up like this.'

Katie opened up about her experiences as she responded to a question asking how she manages to find time to train as a single mum.

The singer shared a snap of herself in her underwear as she showed off her trim physique, writing over the picture: 'You don't 'find time' you 'make time' - me, as soon as my son goes to sleep.'

She then shared a lengthy post in which she explained how she worked hard at her fitness following the birth of her son and said that it wasn't an instant transformation.

She penned: 'As a single mom, how do you find the time to train? If I was given money every time I have been asked this question, I'd be a very rich lady!

'But all humor aside, I have recently found myself deep in thought about this question! Finding time vs making time - wanting and willing to make a change vs continuing a pattern of procrastination.'

Referring to her lingerie-clad image, she said: 'This is me two years post partum. I didn't have my son and then wake up like this, I have worked hard and enjoyed the process of the ebs and flows of a forever lifestyle change, most days are great, some are not, but hey that is life.

'It poses the bigger question then of why are we so insistent that a change needs to be instant? I too have experienced the impatient feeling of 'I wish it would happen right now, right this second' but sometimes a reset, a restore, a rebuild, in whatever it is that we are looking to change doesn't happen overnight.'

The singer then went on to give words of encouragement to her fans and urged them to make their own attainable goals.

She said: 'Tonight, I would love to encourage you to think of a goal of yours, see it, believe it, envisage it, and then tell yourself it is 100000% achievable. Set your end goal and work your way backwards with your HOW.

'Break it down into small achievable parts, conquer them, and build your courage strength and confidence! Before you know it, you would have surpassed that end goal 10 fold and be onto your next one.

'Point in fact, don't FIND time, MAKE time. BELIEVE IN YOU!'

Katie has often been open about her body transformation and had previously shared before and after snaps of her figure.

Back in May, she revealed that after seeing her before picture, she vowed to rebuild her 'physical strength' for the sake of her son.

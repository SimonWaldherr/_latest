Boris Johnson has warned Emmanuel Macron that Brexit negotiators will need to bridge "significant gaps" within days, as Tory sources suggested the French president's stance on fishing was standing in the way of a deal.

In a telephone call on Saturday morning, the Prime Minister warned Mr Macron that "progress must be made" on fishing quotas and the EU's demands for the UK to abide by a "level playing field" of rules, including on industrial subsidies.

Lord Frost, Mr Johnson's chief negotiator, is in the middle of a fortnight of intensive talks with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier as they attempt to avoid a no-deal outcome at the end of the transition period on December 31.

Mr Johnson's intervention came as Conservative sources said the prospect of a deal now turned on whether Mr Macron was prepared to make a "political decision" to compromise on fish â€“ a totemic issue for British and French coastal towns and villages.

The EU's position until now has been to insist on replicating the Common Fisheries Policy, maintaining the access and quota shares enjoyed by EU fishermen before Brexit.

But UK negotiators are insisting that British waters should be subject to annual negotiations that allow British fishermen to reclaim a much greater share of fish.

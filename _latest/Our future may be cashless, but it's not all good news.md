<div><p>But for some, its disappearance&#160;is really bad news. Amusement arcades will have to abandon their Penny Falls machines and make the rest compatible with credit cards. Churches need to convert their collections to digital and charity boxes will be replaced by credit card terminals.</p>
<p>I suspect that my grandchildren will soon forget about cash; they won&#8217;t recognise a &#163;2 coin and probably don&#8217;t bother to pick up a 2p piece from the pavement. With family credit cards and digitally paid pocket money, future generations will be denied the pleasure of a brand new, crisp &#163;20 note and the satisfactory jingle from a pocket full of silver. I still fondly remember florins, half a crown, silver threepenny bits and even the farthing.</p>
<p>Covid has all but killed off cash in my household. Jemima, my physio, arrives armed with a mobile credit card machine and our milkman wants a BACs payment &#8211; anything but money and certainly not a cheque.</p>
<p>I will miss handling the stuff. When working as a shop assistant, I loved cashing up at the end of a busy day, putting notes into &#163;100 piles &#8211; a thrill that I recall each year when counting the cash when we open for the National Garden Scheme (how long will it be before a credit terminal collects the money for tea and cakes?).</p>

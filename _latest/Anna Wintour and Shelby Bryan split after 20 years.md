<div><p>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</p><p>Anna Wintour and telecom millionaire Shelby Bryan have finally split after more than 20 years together, Page Six is told.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d previously reported that things had cooled off between the powerful pair and that they hadn&#8217;t been seen in public together for some time. But now we&#8217;re told they&#8217;re done for good.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear what caused the split, but the chatter around town was that Bryan had gone back to his ex-wife Katherine Bryan, whose husband, investment banker Damon Mezzacappa, died in 2015. But sources close to Katherine tell us that she&#8217;s not back with Bryan &#8212; who stepped out on her when he began an affair with the Cond&#233; Nast honcho back in 1999. &#8220;Katherine and Shelby have kids together [and] are friends. That&#8217;s all,&#8221; said a source when asked about the reunion scuttlebutt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&#8217;re told Bryan has been spending time in his native Texas. In November, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/02/insider-even-at-70-vogues-anna-wintour-is-still-machiavellian/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Page Six reported that things had begun to go sour</a> for Wintour and Bryan back in 2013, after it was revealed <a href="https://nypost.com/2008/11/24/celebs-queezed/?_ga=2.34213670.620586509.1603132926-1787833842.1590516714" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he owed the IRS some $1.2 million in back taxes. </a></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been quite a while since they&#8217;ve been seen together,&#8221; said a source at the time.</p>
<p>Bryan didn&#8217;t respond to our request for comment. A rep for Wintour declined to comment.</p>

Senior advisers to Joe Biden reportedly cannot rule out that the former vice president and Democratic White House hopeful met with a top Ukrainian energy executive, despite carefully-worded rebuttals from his campaign.

Michael Carpenter and Amos Hochstein, who worked for Biden when he was vice president in 2015, told Politico that they couldn’t definitively state that their boss was never approached by Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Biden’s campaign also could not say whether the meeting happened or not.

Burisma formerly employed Biden’s son, Hunter, in a lucrative board position.

Emails obtained by The Post from a hard drive that allegedly once belonged to Hunter indicate that he was thanked by Pozharskyi for introducing him to his dad in April 2015 — while the elder Biden was vice president.

“Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It’s realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,” the email reads.

The alleged introduction would undercut Joe Biden’s insistence that he and his son never discussed the younger Biden’s heavily-scrutinized overseas business dealings.

Carpenter and Hochstein — who served the then-vice president at the time of the alleged introduction — claimed to Politico they ever heard of Pozharskyi.

In a carefully-worded statement, Biden’s White House campaign has said that the introduction does not appear on any “official schedules” for the would-be president.

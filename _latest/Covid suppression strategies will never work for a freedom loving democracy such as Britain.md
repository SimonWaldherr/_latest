Leaving aside China’s shameful complicity in the early, devastating spread of the SARS Cov-2 virus, the country’s success in suppressing the disease within its own borders seems pretty much unarguable. The fact is that Chinese eradication strategies have proved extraordinarily effective, raising some disturbing questions for Western democracies, with their love of individualism, belief in basic freedoms, and tolerant attitude to nonconformity and dissent.

Regrettably, these characteristics have not been helpful in confronting Covid. We have proved peculiarly unprepared for and unsuited to dealing with a global pandemic. Authoritarian China, on the other hand, seems to have been almost tailor made for it.

It locked down early and hard in a dictatorial manner widely thought of at the time as likely to be intolerable in any Western democracy; all public transport was suspended and more than a thousand checkpoints were established across the country to ensure compliance with travel bans; outdoor activity was severely restricted in dozens of cities, with citizens effectively imprisoned in their own houses.

Perhaps most important of all, a highly effective mass test, track and trace system with state-of-the-art use of surveillance technologies was rapidly put in place. Those who tested positive, even if not ill, were taken from their homes and quarantined in hostels, where they were denied all physical contact with the outside world, including family and friends.

Even the smallest level of infection invites an immediate, and by Western standards, heavy handed response. A recent outbreak in a Qingdao hospital, affecting just 12 people, was countered by mass testing which saw nearly half the city’s entire population of 9.4 million people tested within 48 hours.

By contrast, Britain and much of the rest of Europe are still struggling to test adequately even in areas of very high infection, and that’s more than six months after the pandemic began. Would there even have been any point in suppressing the infection via Chinese methods when we still don’t have the rapid detection and response mechanisms in place to keep the virus at bay for when it erupts anew?

But it is not just China which has achieved success with the “suppression so as to return to normality” approach. Other standout successes are South Korea and Japan, both of which have managed to ride the storm with only relatively informal versions of lockdown.

Go to Tokyo, and apart from the lack of tourists, you wouldn’t notice the difference from pre-Covid days. As in China, the economic harm has been far less severe than in Europe and the US.

In a recent interview, Japan’s finance minister, Taro Aso, attributed this success to better “mindo”, a faintly racist term that implies ethnic superiority and more refined “cultural standards”.

Cleanliness, conformity, deference to authority, and belief in the common good as a higher calling than the rights of the individual, are not characteristics confined to China. They apply in varying degrees to much of South East Asia, where in any case obesity is far less common than the West, another uncomfortable truth alluded to in Taro Aso’s remarks.

This is not, however, the American or European way. You cannot help but see a wider authoritarian agenda in those who argue we should mirror the Chinese approach. The fact is that it is incompatible with a liberally minded society.

The response we have ended up with on the other hand is neither fish nor fowl; it reflects neither the command and control characteristics of the totalitarian state nor the laissez faire beliefs of those of us who think that, as with all past pandemics, we must simply live as normally as we can with the virus for as long as it takes to fizzle out.

Instead we have a kind of halfway house in which we lurch from one economically destructive and socially divisive lockdown to the next in the vague hope of a vaccine. Return to normality looks as far away as ever.

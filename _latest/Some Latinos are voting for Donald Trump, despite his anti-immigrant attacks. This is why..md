Bernie Sanders in 2016. But after the bitter Democratic primary that left Hillary Clinton as the party&#8217;s presidential nominee, the son of Dominican immigrants&#160;cast his ballot for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This year, Marte, 27, of Union City, will complete an even longer political journey: He's voting for President Donald Trump, attracted by the Republican Party's "Judeo-Christian" values and the president's economic record before the coronavirus hit. He says he also likes Trump's plans for securing the southern border and restricting illegal immigration.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;We have to elevate ourselves and I think Donald Trump is the only president that I&#8217;ve seen in my adult life that is putting America&#8217;s citizens' values front forward," said Marte, who works in the banking industry. "No matter what, we can still get out of where we are and empower ourselves to make our lives better ... He is putting that right in front of us.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Marcos Marte is a former Bernie Sanders supporter, but now backs Donald Trump for the 2020 election.

In the White House, he's moved&#160;to curb both legal and illegal immigration and questioned why the U.S. should take in people from "s---hole countries" like El Salvador and Haiti.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-2" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Yet&#160;Trump received between 20 to 28% of the Latino vote in 2016, according to various exit polls,&#160;and he's poised to get around the same in 2020. One Quinnipiac University poll last month had&#160;Trump leading Joe Biden&#160;among Latinos in the battleground state of Florida by 45% to 43%, though the difference was within the margin of error.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen any data to suggest that his numbers among Latinos are better than in 2016, but what surprises me is that they are not worse,&#8217;&#8217; said Adrian Pantoja, a senior analyst for polling firm Latino Decisions and professor of political and Chicano studies at Pitzer College in California.&#160;</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-3" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Voting live updates:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/21/voting-election-live-updates-mississippi-florida-wisconsin/5994391002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Florida residents get email threats; COVID-19 patients can vote curbside in Mississippi</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Latinos are not monolithic, of course.&#160;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2020/09/23/the-changing-racial-and-ethnic-composition-of-the-u-s-electorate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">A 2018 national survey from the Pew Research Center found </a>that voters of&#160;Puerto Rican and Mexican backgrounds were more likely to be Democrats, while those of Cuban descent, who fled Fidel Castro's communist dictatorship, leaned&#160;Republican.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In interviews, Latinos who back Trump cite the president's business background and&#160;the record employment numbers for Black and Hispanic Americans before the pandemic. They like the take-no-prisoners "energy" he brings to the office, even if that&#160;combative style has turned off other voters.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fernando Alonso, an attorney from Oradell, New Jersey whose parents emigrated from Cuba decades ago, said the violence that's broken out at some racial justice protests has also turned off voters who may have memories of unstable, violent regimes in their home countries. Trump has blamed the unrest on Democrats.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Safety is really important to them," said Alonso,&#160;who leads the Bergen County Hispanic Republican Association. "When they see those things on television, the riots, it&#8217;s not something they came to the United States to be part of.&#8221;</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Economy is a big issue</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Latinos make up the largest minority voting group in the country, with 32 million&#160;projected to be eligible to vote in next month&#8217;s election. The Garden State is home to about 948,000&#160;of those eligible voters,&#160;according to Pew.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Biden is expected to easily win a majority of Hispanic voters nationwide.

Gonzalez, a product of the Cuban American community that's flourished in and around Union City, New Jersey will vote in his first presidential election next month and cast his ballot for Trump.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Kennith Gonzalez, the Republican chairman of Union City, says Latino Trump voters like the president's energy and his economic policies."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A political science student at Seton Hall University, Gonzalez said Latinos he speaks to often cite the economy as their main issue, and he points to the improved jobless rate&#160;as well as gains in the stock market during Trump's first term. &#160;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Unemployment for Hispanics in the U.S. fell to a record low 3.9% in September 2019.

The retired Marine from Sicklerville, in Camden County, said she has always been in tune with the Republican platforms of smaller government and describes herself as a staunch constitutionalist. She voted for Trump in 2016 and will back him this year as well.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Denise Gonzalez of Sicklerville and daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants plans to vote for Donald Trump in this year's presidential election."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The mortgage loan officer&#160;credits the president for bills passed this spring to give businesses and families $2 trillion in coronavirus relief, money that helped keep millions of employees on payrolls nationwide.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;He has done more for people of color and for Americans in general,&#8217;&#8217; she said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Trump may not be an &#8220;eloquent orator,&#8217;&#8217; Gonzalez said, but she defended him&#160;against critics who call&#160;him racist. That's partly based on her experience more than 20 years ago, when she worked as a bartender at one of Trump&#8217;s&#160;casinos&#160;in Atlantic City.</p><p id="~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-politics-5" class="gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;I&#8217;ve met him personally and many of his executives were extremely diverse,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;Trump used to show up on his properties and would ask people at the bottom of the totem pole what can we do for you, how can we help you, how can we make your job easier?&#160;He cares.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Marte said he was more interested four years ago in how he would pay for college. That led him to&#160;Sanders, who ran on lowering student loan interest rates and free tuition for state colleges and universities.&#160;</p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="Marcos Marte is a former Bernie Sanders supporter, but now backs Donald Trump for the 2020 election.

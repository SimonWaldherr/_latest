China aims to test more than nine million residents of the port city of Qingdao within five days following a minor coronavirus outbreak, health officials said Monday, the first mass testing in months.

The country where the virus first emerged has largely controlled its outbreak, cutting a stark contrast to many parts of the world still afflicted by rolling lockdowns and high case numbers.

On Sunday, six cases were confirmed in Qingdao - a northeastern city of 9.4 million - originating in a hospital, the Qingdao municipal health commission said in a statement on Monday.

Five districts will be tested "within three days" and the whole city "within five days", the statement said. However, officials did not give a precise figure on how many people would be tested.

China has extensive, quick test capabilities and the health commission said over 140,000 employees of "medical institutions, newly admitted patients and personnel" have already been tested in Qingdao since the cases were confirmed.

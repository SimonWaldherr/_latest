The Jets’ regular season is getting impacted by COVID-19 for the first time.

Players and coaches were sent home from the team’s training center on Friday after a presumptive positive test, according to a source. The player was re-tested to see if he is indeed positive and the Jets should know the results later today.

The 0-4 Jets are scheduled to play the Cardinals on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. That game may be in jeopardy now. The league had two games postponed last week and have already rescheduled two games — Titans vs. Bills and Patriots vs. Broncos — this week as teams experience positive tests.

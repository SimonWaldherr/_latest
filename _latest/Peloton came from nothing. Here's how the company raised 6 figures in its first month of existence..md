Before Peloton became a household name with a cult-like following, it took the same avenue many startups pursue to raise money: A Kickstarter campaign.

In June 2013, Peloton posted on the crowdfunding site that it was seeking $250,000 to finance the creation of its bike. In less than a month, 297 backers pledged $307,332, according to Kickstarter.

Now, the company is celebrating its first profitable quarter, with revenue jumping 172% year over year to $607 million, according to the company's shareholder letter.

Meanwhile, many entrepreneurs and businesses are turning to crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter, Kiva, Indiegogo, and StartEngine in light of the pandemic. The platforms provide an opportunity to raise capital and loans and build a strong consumer base.

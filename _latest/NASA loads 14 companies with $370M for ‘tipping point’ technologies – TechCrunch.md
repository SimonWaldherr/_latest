  NASA loads 14 companies with $370M for ‘tipping point’ technologies – TechCrunch 
description: > 
  NASA has announced more than a third of a billion dollars worth of “Tipping Point” contracts awarded to over a dozen companies pursuing potentially transformative space technologies.The projects range from in-space testing of cryogenic tech to a 4G LTE network for the Moon.The space agency is almost always accepting applications for at least one of its many grant and contract programs, and Tipping Point is directly aimed at commercial space capabilities that need a bit of a boost.According to the program description, “a technology is considered at a tipping point if an investment in a demonstration will significantly mature the technology, increase the likelihood of infusion into a commercial space application, and bring the technology to market for both government and commercial applications.”In this year’s awards, which take the form of multi-year contracts with multiple milestones, the focus was on two main areas: cryogenics and lunar surface tech.Note that the amounts provided are not necessarily the cost of developing the tech, but rather the sums deemed necessary to advance it to the next stage.

NASA has announced more than a third of a billion dollars worth of “Tipping Point” contracts awarded to over a dozen companies pursuing potentially transformative space technologies. The projects range from in-space testing of cryogenic tech to a 4G LTE network for the Moon.

The space agency is almost always accepting applications for at least one of its many grant and contract programs, and Tipping Point is directly aimed at commercial space capabilities that need a bit of a boost. According to the program description, “a technology is considered at a tipping point if an investment in a demonstration will significantly mature the technology, increase the likelihood of infusion into a commercial space application, and bring the technology to market for both government and commercial applications.”

In this year’s awards, which take the form of multi-year contracts with multiple milestones, the focus was on two main areas: cryogenics and lunar surface tech. Note that the amounts provided are not necessarily the cost of developing the tech, but rather the sums deemed necessary to advance it to the next stage. Here’s a brief summary of each award:

Cryogenics

Eta Space, $27M : In-space demonstration of a complete cryogenic oxygen management system

: In-space demonstration of a complete cryogenic oxygen management system Lockheed Martin, $89.7M : In-space demonstration of liquid hydrogen in over a dozen cryogenic applications

: In-space demonstration of liquid hydrogen in over a dozen cryogenic applications SpaceX, $53.2M : Flight demonstration transferring 10 tons of liquid oxygen between tanks in Starship

: Flight demonstration transferring 10 tons of liquid oxygen between tanks in Starship ULA, $86.2M: Demonstration of a smart propulsion cryogenic system on a Vulcan Centaur upper stage

Lunar surface innovation

Alpha Space Test and Research Alliance, $22.1M : Develop a small tech and science platform for lunar surface testing

: Develop a small tech and science platform for lunar surface testing Astrobotic, $5.8M : “Mature” a fast wireless charging system for use on the lunar surface

: “Mature” a fast wireless charging system for use on the lunar surface Intuitive Machines, $41.6M : Develop a hopper lander with a 2.2-pound payload capacity and 1.5-mile range

: Develop a hopper lander with a 2.2-pound payload capacity and 1.5-mile range Masten Space Systems, $2.8M : Demonstrate a universal chemical heat and power source for lunar nights and craters

: Demonstrate a universal chemical heat and power source for lunar nights and craters Masten Space Systems, $10M : Demonstrate precision landing an hazard avoidance on its Xogdor vehicle (Separate award under “descent and landing” heading)

: Demonstrate precision landing an hazard avoidance on its Xogdor vehicle (Separate award under “descent and landing” heading) Nokia of America, $14.1M : Deploy the first LTE network in space for lunar surface communications

: Deploy the first LTE network in space for lunar surface communications pH Matter, $3.4M : Demonstrate a fuel cell for producing and storing energy on the lunar surface

: Demonstrate a fuel cell for producing and storing energy on the lunar surface Precision Compustion, $2.4M : Advance a cheap oxide fuel stack to generate power from propellants

: Advance a cheap oxide fuel stack to generate power from propellants Sierra Nevada, $2.4M : Demonstrate a device using solar energy to extract oxygen from lunar regolith

: Demonstrate a device using solar energy to extract oxygen from lunar regolith SSL Robotics, $8.7M : Develop a lighter, cheaper robotic arm for surface, orbital, and “terrestrial defense” applications

: Develop a lighter, cheaper robotic arm for surface, orbital, and “terrestrial defense” applications Teledyne Energy Systems, $2.8M: Develop a hydrogen fuel cell power system with a 10,000-hour battery life

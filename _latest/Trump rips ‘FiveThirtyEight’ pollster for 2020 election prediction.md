President Trump blasted a polling site that gave him a slim chance of winning the November election against former Vice President Joe Biden and cited his “shocking” win over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

“@NateSilver538 ‘The Trump 2016 Victory was the most shocking political development of my lifetime.’ That’s only because you got it so wrong,” Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday.

“This time there is far more ENTHUSIASM even than 2016. Winning many States much more easily than people understand. BIG CROWDS!!!,” the president continued.

The pollster “FiveThirtyEight” gave Trump a 14 percent chance of winning the election and Biden a 86 percent chance, citing 40,000 simulations it ran of the November contest.

In 2016, the polling site said Clinton had a 71.4 percent chance of winning and Trump had a 28.6 percent chance.

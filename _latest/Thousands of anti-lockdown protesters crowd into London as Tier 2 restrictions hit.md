Thousands of anti-lockdown demonstrators gathered in central London in protest against coronavirus Tier 2 restrictions which came into force in the capital today.

Led by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's brother Piers, demonstrators chanted conspiracy theories such as "stick your poison vaccine up your arse", "take off your masks" and "we are the 99%" as they walked down Oxford Street.

Some carried conspiracy-encouraging placards blaming the virus on the new 5G network, while others claimed the virus itself was a hoax.

The protest comes on the day London was placed in Tier 2 lockdown measures, meaning people in the capital are now banned from meeting people from outside their household indoors, and a maximum of six outdoors.

Demonstrators took a detour to Rathbone Square to stand outside Facebook's London headquarters which many have blamed for spreading pandemic misinformation.

The protest later came to a halt in Leicester Square outside the Imax theatre, although it was unclear why as they had originally stated they were heading for Downing Street.

Many of those gathered carried signs reading "my body, my choice", a slogan borrowed from the pro-choice movement.

One of the organisers told a breakaway group outside Downing Street: "Man flu has closed our country and crushed our economy."

Piers Corbyn, who has previously been fined the maximum Â£10,000 for his anti-lockdown protests, also took part in a demonstration in Soho on Friday night.

"We're here to drink against the curfew," he said.

"To oppose the lockdowns, to oppose job losses caused by lockdowns, to oppose all of of it.

"The whole lot should be lifted now."

More than half of England's residents - 28 million people - are now living under Tier 2 and Tier 3 lockdowns after restrictions were tightened in places such as Lancashire, London, most of Essex and York.

Lancashire entered a Tier 3 lockdown, which carries the toughest restrictions on socialising, at 12.01am on Saturday. It joined Liverpool as the only regions at that level, but Greater Manchester could join them next week.

Under the most severe controls, pubs and bars closed unless they can serve meals and indoor mixing banned.

Tier 2 measures in London, most of Essex, York, Elmbridge, Barrow-in-Furness, North East Derbyshire, Erewash and Chesterfield mean people can no longer mix inside with those from other households, including in pubs and restaurants.

Wales also banned people in Tier 2 or 3 areas in England, as well as the central belt of Scotland and the whole of Northern Ireland, from entering as of 6pm on Friday.

The Welsh Government was to meet to discuss a circuit-breaker lockdown and will announce any decisions on Monday.

Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland had to close their doors to sit-in customers as a four-week circuit-breaker went into affect from Friday.

Scotland is due to reveal details of its new tiered lockdown system later this month.

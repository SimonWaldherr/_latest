<div><p>Reps. <a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567752/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> and <a href="https://time.com/5628844/ilhan-omar-profile/">Ilhan Omar</a> shook things up on <a href="https://time.com/5201151/drake/">Twitch</a> on Tuesday with a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/776770697" target="_blank">livestream</a> of the hugely popular <a href="https://time.com/5872912/best-video-games-2020-so-far/">video game</a> Among Us that drew over 400,000 viewers at its peak.</p>
                  <p>In an effort to encourage people to vote in the <a href="https://time.com/5887437/conspiracy-theories-2020-election/">2020 election</a>, the two Democratic congresswomen played the online murder mystery game that has risen in popularity alongside Twitch stars like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pokimane</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hasanabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HasanAbi</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/myth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Myth</a>.</p>
                    <p class="component embed-twitter js-embed-twitter social-embed"></p>
                  <p>Ocasio-Cortez&#8217;s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/AOC" target="_blank">livestream</a>, her first on Twitch and one of the most-watched streams in the service&#8217;s history, lasted for over three hours and garnered nearly 4.8 million total views. It was <a href="https://twitter.com/stevensonpj/status/1318727897688014850?s=21" target="_blank">reportedly</a> the lead referrer to <a href="https://iwillvote.com" target="_blank">IWillVote.com</a> for at least part of its duration.</p>
                    <p class="component embed-twitter js-embed-twitter social-embed"></p>
                  <p>On Monday, Ocasio-Cortez put out an open call on Twitter for players to join her in Tuesday&#8217;s game. &#8220;Anyone want to play Among Us with me on Twitch to get out the vote? (I&#8217;ve never played but it looks like a lot of fun),&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1318276809977434112" target="_blank">she wrote</a>, garnering replies from Omar, <a href="https://twitter.com/hasanthehun/status/1318277084146327552" target="_blank">HasanAbi</a> and thousands of others.</p>
                  <p>Among Us is a covert multiplayer game, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)" target="_blank">Mafia</a>, that takes places on an alien spaceship and has skyrocketed in popularity amid the pandemic. Although it was originally released in 2018, it wasn&#8217;t until the past few months that the multiplayer social deduction game exploded in the charts&#8212;as of Oct. 1, it had been downloaded over 100 million times, according to its U.S.-based developer, InnerSloth. In addition to its simple premise, some of the game&#8217;s appeal stems from the fact that it supports cross-play across multiple platforms&#8212;including Android and iOS&#8212;making it easy for groups of friends to play with each other while staying distanced.</p>

                    </p>
                  <p>Because of the popularity of the stream, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aoc" target="_blank">Ocasio-Cortez&#8217;s Twitch channel</a> now has more than 584,000 followers. Both <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/donaldtrump" target="_blank">President Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bernie_sanders" target="_blank">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> also have accounts on the platform, but only have 143,000 and 159,000 followers, respectively.</p>
                  <p>Twitch has seen marked growth in recent years, and especially since the start of the pandemic. <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/statistics" target="_blank">According to TwitchTracker.com</a>, the streaming website boasts an average of over 2 million concurrent viewers in 2020, almost double what it recorded in 2019.</p>

                  <p>As Ocasio-Cortez mentioned in her tweets, the goal of the livestream was to spur potential voters to register and get to the polls. &#8220;I&#8217;m so excited by this upcoming election,&#8221; she said during the stream. &#8220;We can overwhelm the polls, and we can get things back on track.&#8221;</p>
                    <p class="component embed-twitter js-embed-twitter social-embed"></p>
                  <p>Following the game, Myth, a Twitch streamer with over 7 million followers, shared on Twitter that he was planning on voting for the first time in the 2020 election. &#8220;Remember to vote this election as well,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/TSM_Myth/status/1318747492792426496" target="_blank">he wrote</a>. &#8220;This election is my first time voting and its super easy to do so do it.&#8221;</p>

                  <p>Ocasio-Cortez has often used alternative methods to reach out to potential voters. She has previously made appeals to millennial and Gen Z gamers with a foray into the world of 2020&#8217;s hit game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. She has also connected with younger voters by talking politics on Instagram live while doing things like assembling IKEA furniture and cooking dinner.</p>

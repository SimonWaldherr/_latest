  The chilling true story behind Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca 
description: > 
  Fans of Daphne du Maurier’s most famous novel Rebecca, now adapted for Netflix starring Lily James and Armie Hammer, will remember the moment its nameless narrator opens one of her husband’s books to find an inscription from his dead first wife.“A little blob of ink marred the white page opposite, as though the writer, in impatience, had shaken her pen to make the ink flow more freely.And then as it bubbled through the nib, it came a little thick, so that the name… stood out black and strong, the tall and sloping R dwarfing the other letters.”It’s as close as we get to the physical presence of the woman who gives the novel its name and stalks its pages, conjured up in the elegant curves of that R.In director Ben Wheatley’s new film version, the moment is amplified by the choice of book: an anthology of love poetry, which the narrator (Lily James) finds in the glove compartment of her suitor Max’s (Armie Hammer) car.Wheatley knows the importance of the “R” – how its elegant curves become the visual manifestation of the woman who gives the story its name and whose memory haunts her successor.As the viewer watches through the narrator’s increasingly paranoid eyes, the image recurs everywhere: stitched into handkerchiefs she finds in her coat pockets, monogrammed onto guests books and invitations cards for parties the splendour of which she can never recreate, carved into the silver-backed hairbrush lined with hairs so much darker and richer than her own, echoed in the foreboding name of the boat she died in, even suggested by the contours of a flock of birds circling over the sea.

<div><p>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</p><p>Naomi Campbell has always been a trendsetter.</p>
<p>The model, 50, has always played it safe when it comes to her health, often wiping down surfaces, wearing gloves and loading up on vitamins while traveling &#8212; and she&#8217;s stepped up her routine significantly amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Campbell went viral in March when she <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/03/13/naomi-campbell-explains-her-hazmat-suit-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/">added&#160; a full hazmat suit</a>, goggles and a face shield to her airplane routine.</p>
<p>Now, the fashion icon says that she&#8217;s been asked to donate her PPE to a museum.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCNhmHihR1U&amp;feature=emb_title" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an appearance on &#8220;Hot Ones,&#8221;</a> Campbell said there was a &#8220;big chance&#8221; that her suit will get a high-fashion upgrade on the runway one day soon, and said that hers is set to become a part of history.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been asked to put my hazmat suit into a museum. They asked me for the one that I actually wore and my Burberry cape that I put on top of it,&#8221; she told host Sean Evans, without specifying the museum in question.</p>
<p>While she has no qualms about being seen in protective gear, Campbell did say that today&#8217;s streetwear &#8220;confuses&#8221; her, and that she&#8217;d never be caught dead in Crocs, calling them &#8220;a lazy shoe.&#8221;</p>

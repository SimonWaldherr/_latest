“From Abdullah, the servant of Allah, to Macron, the leader of the infidels, I executed one of your hell dogs who dared to belittle Muhammad,” the Tweet said.

Witnesses told police they heard the assailant shouting “Allahu Akbar” [‘God is the greatest’ in Arabic] before he was shot by officers. No explosives were found on his body after it was checked by a bomb disposal unit.

Police sources said the teacher had received death threats after giving a class during which he showed pupils the controversial cartoons, which were reported to depict the Prophet Mohammed naked. The teacher’s name and school were posted on social media.

A week earlier, one man who said his daughter was in Mr Paty's class recorded a video shared on social media in which he branded the teacher a thug and appealed to others to "join forces and say 'stop, don't touch our children'".

It was not clear whether the parent was one of those in police custody. It was also not immediately known if the attacker had seen the video.

Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-François Ricard will give a press conference on Saturday afternoon.

At the school, parents and teachers paid tribute to Mr Paty, who was said to have been widely liked and himself a father.

His former student Martial, 16, said the teacher loved his job. "He really wanted to teach us things - sometimes we had debates," he said.

Another student Tiago said he saw Paty on the day he died. "He came to my class to see our teacher. It's shocking that I won't see him again," he said.

"According to my son, he was super nice, super friendly, super kind," Nordine Chaouadi, a parent of one of Mr Paty's students, told AFP.

The teacher "simply said to the Muslim children: 'Leave, I don't want it to hurt your feelings.' That's what my son told me," the parent said.

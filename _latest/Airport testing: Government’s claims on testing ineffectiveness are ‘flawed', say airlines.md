  Airport testing: Government’s claims on testing ineffectiveness are ‘flawed', say airlines 
description: > 
  Claims by the prime minister, the transport secretary and other ministers that testing passengers at airports is ineffective are based on “flawed and outdated assumptions,” according to a top airline boss.Boris Johnson and Grant Shapps have repeatedly dismissed appeals by airlines and airports to test travellers arriving in the UK, citing a theoretical study in June by Public Health England (PHE) which predicts only 7 per cent of asymptomatic cases of coronavirus would be identified.A government spokesperson rejected the review’s criticism, saying: “The scientific evidence on testing international arrivals was reviewed and approved by Sage."Scientific modelling groups and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine independently generated similar results.“International arrivals from non-exempt countries must quarantine for the full 14 days as the incubation period for the virus means passengers who do not follow this advice may pose a risk to others.

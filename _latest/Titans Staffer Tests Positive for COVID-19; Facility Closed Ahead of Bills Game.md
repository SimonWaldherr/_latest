The Tennessee Titans have once again shut down their team facility after a staff member tested positive for COVID-19.

"This morning we learned that a staff member tested positive. We have temporarily closed our facility and are in communication with the league on the next steps," the team said in a statement.

The Titans have had the NFL's most pronounced COVID-19 outbreak of the season, with more than 20 players and staff testing positive. They were already forced to push back their Week 4 matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and their Week 5 clash against the Buffalo Bills was moved to Tuesday.

The team had just returned to its facilities Saturday after consecutive days of negative testing.

This article will be updated to provide more information soon.

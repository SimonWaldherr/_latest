  Newsom says California will independently review coronavirus vaccine: 'We won't take anyone's word for it' 
description: > 
  Gavin Newsom said the state will independently review the Trump administration's anticipated coronavirus vaccine before approving distribution to its 39 million residents."Of course we won't take anyone's word for it," Newsom said Monday as he named 11 doctors and scientists to review any rollout of vaccines by the federal government or vaccine developers.It is unclear whether the independent review process will set back the distribution process for New York and California in comparison to other states that may be able to deploy it and potentially slow the spread of COVID-19 at a faster rate.He later told ABC's "Good Morning America" that Americans should be "very skeptical" of taking the vaccine."The process that's going on in trying to prove the safety and the efficacy of a number of vaccines is a sound process," he said.

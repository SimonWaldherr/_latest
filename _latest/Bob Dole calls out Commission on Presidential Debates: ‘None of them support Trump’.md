Former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole took to Twitter Friday to call out the Commission on Presidential Debates, saying it was rigged against President Trump — even though half its members are Republicans.

“The Commission on Presidential Debates is supposedly bipartisan w/ an equal number of Rs and Ds. I know all of the Republicans and most are friends of mine. I am concerned that none of them support @realDonaldTrump. A biased Debate Commission is unfair,” the 97-year-old ex-senator told his followers.

On Friday the commission — which controls the three presidential debates — announced that its second debate between President Trump and Joe Biden would be scrapped, putting the event officially out of its misery after it was beset by controversies.

After Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis, the commission ruled that the president and Joe Biden would partake in a virtual debate — something the Trump Team rejected.

Ongoing negotiations over format were then overshadowed by C-SPAN when network host and debate moderator Steve Scully publicly solicited advice from estranged Trump Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci.

“@Scaramucci should I respond to trump,” Scully wrote.

“Ignore. He is having a hard enough time. Some more bad stuff about to go down,” The Mooch replied. Since leaving the White House, Scaramucci has emerged as a ferocious Trump critic.

The exchange took place just minutes after Trump attacked Scully during an appearance with Fox News’ Sean Hannity.

In a statement, C-SPAN claimed their political editor was hacked.

“Steve Scully did not originate the tweets and believes his account has been hacked. The Commission on Presidential Debates has stated publicly that the tweet was not sent by Scully himself and is investigating with the help of authorities,” the network said.

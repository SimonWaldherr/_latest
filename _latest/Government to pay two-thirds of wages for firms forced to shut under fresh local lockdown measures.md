Under the existing job support scheme announced by Mr Sunak last month, employers had to pay 55 per cent of their staff’s wages, with the Government paying 22 per cent and the employee foregoing the rest.

Employees are also required to complete a third of their normal working hours to enroll.

However, in an effective return to the original furlough scheme announced at the beginning of lockdown, the Treasury will waive employer contributions for firms forced to shut under fresh Government restrictions.

From November, premises legally required to shut for a period over the winter will be paid 67 per cent of each employees’ salary, up to a maximum of £2,100 a month.

Employers will only have to pay national insurance contributions and pension contributions, although Treasury insiders suggested half the firms who would benefit from the system would not pay any additional costs.

The scheme is UK wide and will allow firms to alternate back and forth between the full-time subsidy and part-time subsidy depending on the level of restrictions they are placed under.

Firms banned from operating indoors, such as in Scotland, where pubs are limited to serving outdoors for 16 days, will also be eligible.

It will come into effect in November, with firms which are forced to shut beforehand still able to apply for wage support under the existing furlough scheme, which ends at the end of the month.

The cash grants system, which currently provides payments of £1,500 every three weeks to firms forced to close under local lockdowns, has also been made more generous.

Large firms will now receive up to £3,000 a month, while medium sized businesses will be able to claim £2,000 and small businesses £1,300.

The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will benefit from a £1.3bn increase to their guaranteed funding for 2020-21 - allowing them to continue their response to Covid-19 including through similar measures if they wish.

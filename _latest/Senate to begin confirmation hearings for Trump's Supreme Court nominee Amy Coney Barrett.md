WASHINGTON – The Senate will start confirmation hearings Monday for President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett as Republicans aim to confirm her to the Supreme Court before Election Day.

Monday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is the first of four days of confirmation hearings. All 22 senators on the panel will give opening 10-minute statements, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Barrett will be introduced by Indiana's two Republican senators Todd Young and Mike Braun, and former Notre Dame Professor Patricia O'Hara, one of Barrett's mentors. The judge will also deliver her own opening statement.

"Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life," Barrett says in her planned remarks. "The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the People. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try."

Don't expect a vote on Barrett this week. The committee won’t vote until after it holds Barrett’s nomination for one week, a common practice by the panel. The committee vote is expected around Oct. 22 and is likely to split along party lines, 12-10. Then her nomination will go to the full Senate, where she'll need at least a majority to be confirmed to the high court.

Republicans are determined to advance Barrett's confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at a Friday event in Kentucky "the first item of priority in the Senate is the Supreme Court."

Democrats have called for the nomination to be postponed until after the election but acknowledge they neither have the votes to delay the hearing, nor do they have the votes to block Barrett from ultimately being confirmed to the high court. Instead, they aim to highlight parts of Barrett's record they view as problematic, especially with regards to health care.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat and a member of the committee, said Sunday on "Meet the Press" Barrett had been sent "on assignment" by Trump to the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act and to rule on election-related cases.

Democrats plan to avoid asking about Barrett's personal background and beliefs, however. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, also a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" Barrett's religion was "immaterial" to her confirmation. Hirono was instead "totally focused" on Barrett's views regarding the Affordable Care Act, she said.

Democratic lawmakers have also expressed concerns about safety at the hearing as multiple Republican senators tested positive for COVID-19 this month. Congress does not have a COVID-19 testing program.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Friday in a letter to Graham that the hearing posed "serious risks" and they urged him against "unsafely moving forward with these hearings while no clear testing regime is in place to ensure that they do not become another super-spreader of this deadly virus."

Harris and Leahy have since said they would take part in the hearings remotely in the absence of a standardized COVID-19 testing program in the Senate.

Two of the panel's members, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, announced positive tests for COVID-19 on Oct. 2 and went into quarantine, though both senators indicated they would attend the hearings either virtually or in-person.

Graham has said the hearings would be conducted "safely," limits will be placed on the number of people in the hearing room, and the hearing itself has been moved to a larger room.

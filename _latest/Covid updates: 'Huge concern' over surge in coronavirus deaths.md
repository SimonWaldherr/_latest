UK shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said a "clear plan" was now needed, as opposed to more soundbites from the government.

Speaking during the Commons debate on coronavirus restrictions, Ashworth said the prime minister had been too slow to act against the virus.

Referring to guidance released by the government's scientific advisers which showed ministers had implemented just one of a series of recommendations to halt the spread of the virus, Ashworth said: "Now, after the prime minister spoke, we see yet again he is being advised to take action and has so far refused.

"But it's the same virus, the same delays, the same country and the same government making the same mistakes again.

"Our constituents will ask: is history repeating itself?

"Because if these tiers don't work, then what? Tier 4? Tier 5? What's the plan? Well, there isn't one.

"We had whack-a-mole, a fairground game but it was never a strategy.

"It was just a soundbite from the circus ring showman. We've had exaggerated claims, complaints when challenged, a lack of transparency with the public but now further action and a clear plan is needed."

Now you can “Learn it. Know it. Live it.” Literally.

For the first time in 20 years, the house from “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” where Brad and Stacy Hamilton resided is up for sale.

Listed by Pinnacle Estate Properties for $739,999, the iconic home boasts three bedrooms, two bathrooms and, of course, the scene of many of the film’s shoots: the swimming pool.

The listing notes: “How often do you have a truly rare opportunity to live in a home where a famous movie was filmed? Your opportunity is now!”

While the West Hills home looks the same as it did in the 1982 comedy, it has been updated over the years as the listing lavishly describes: “As you pull onto the driveway you will immediately be impressed by the serine (sic) landscaped front yard and freshly painted exterior. You will walk into the living room with its warm hardwood floors and the charm this home so easily radiates. You will treat your family or guests to a morning cup of coffee in the secluded backyard which boasts a private patio, two wooden decks, and a beautiful sparkling newly plastered swimming pool.”

The house has a new roof and water heater as well as a jacuzzi, and the backyard has a surround sound system in place.

Weighted blankets are having a bit of a moment right now. It seems you can’t shake a stick without hearing an influencer waxing lyrical about the benefits of these things.

The claims include a better night’s sleep, reduced anxiety, falling asleep more quickly, and less movement in the night. A weighted blanket is the panacea for all that ails your slumber, according to proponents.

But what might surprise you is that there’s science backing up at least some of these claims. A 2008 study published in Occupational Therapy and Mental Health found that 63 per cent of adults reported lower anxiety after sleeping with a 14kg blanket. Similarly, a 2011 study found the “deep touch pressure” offered by the blanket “gives subjects the feelings of safety, relaxation and comfort.” On top of that, weighted blankets have been recommended for use by autistic children and those with sensory issues. And they've been used as calming tools in psychiatric facilities for years.

The idea behind them is we are set up to like a bit of pressure. From swaddling a baby to hugging, a squeeze is supposed to help us feel comforted and secure. Of course, whether or not you feel any benefits from things like hugs will probably help you gauge how much mileage you’ll get out of using a weighted blanket.

From my perspective, I was pretty satisfied with my weighted blanket trials. They certainly were comforting, and I did think they helped me get to sleep faster than usual. From my perspective, top marks - but obviously, it's a subjective thing.

The truth is that most weighted blankets are fairly similar, so finding the best one is more challenging than you might think. Here’s what I found on my search for the best weighted blanket, starting with my favourite…

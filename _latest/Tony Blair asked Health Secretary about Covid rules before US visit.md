<div><p>Tony Blair asked Matt Hancock for guidance on Covid-19 restrictions <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/17/tony-blair-accused-breaking-quarantine-rules-us-trip/">before seemingly ignoring quarantine rules by failing to self-isolate after a trip to the US,</a> The Telegraph can disclose.</p>
<p>It is understood that Mr Blair contacted the Health Secretary directly before flying to Washington DC for an event at the White House. Ten days after his return to London, the former prime minister was photographed leaving a private members club in Mayfair. Under quarantine regulations, Mr Blair should have remained in isolation for two weeks unless he qualified for an exemption.</p>
<p>The Telegraph is not aware of any other exemption that might apply.</p>
<p>The claim - first disclosed in yesterday&#8217;s Sunday Telegraph - risks embroiling Mr Hancock who was consulted before Mr Blair&#8217;s flight to the US on September 14. It is suggested that Mr Blair was aware of the quarantine rules but had sought special dispensation by obtaining an official exemption letter needed to circumvent them. Sources confirmed Mr Hancock had spoken to Mr Blair but advised the 67-year-old to apply to the Foreign Office for the necessary exemption.</p>
<p>But it was unclear why Mr Blair contacted Mr Hancock directly nor why he carried on with the trip if he had concerns he was unable to fulfil the fortnight quarantine. Mr Blair travelled to Washington on a &#163;50 million private jet - a Falcon 7X - to attend a ceremony at the White House at which Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed history-making agreements establishing formal relations.</p>

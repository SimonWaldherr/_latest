description: > 
  Here’s everything you need to know about when and why the clocks go back:When do the clocks going back in 2020?Every year, the clocks go back an hour at 2am on the last Sunday of October.The clocks went forward an hour on Sunday 29 March this year, which marked the beginning of British Summer Time.Therefore, by turning the clocks back an hour during autumn, this provides people with more sunlight in the morning.While the Summer Time Act may have been established following Willett’s proposal, he wasn’t the first to put forward the idea of preserving daylight by changing the clocks.

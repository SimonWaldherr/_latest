Donald Trump said being "immune" to Covid-19 made him feel "so powerful" - telling a crowd in Florida he would give them all a "big fat kiss".

The President threw face masks into the crowd before he spoke at his first campaign rally since falling ill.

He repeated his claim that his doctors had told him he was now immune to coronavirus.

Earlier, Trump's physician said he had tested negative for the virus on consecutive days.

He mocked Joe Biden, claiming his opponent had got confused about whether he was running for President or Senate - which was untrue.

And moments later he urged the people of Puerto Rico to vote for him.

He said: "I'm not gonna say the best, but I'm just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico.

"You better vote for me, Puerto Rico."

As an overseas territory, rather than a state, Puerto Rico cannot vote in the Presidential Election.

During a rant about Covid-19 lockdowns, the President said: "If you don't feel good about it, if you're not relaxed then stay. But if you want to get out there, get out."

He added: "One thing from me, the nice part, I went through it, they say I'm immune, I feel so powerful.

"I'll walk right out into that audience. I'll walk out there I'll kiss everyone in that audience.

"I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and everybody.

"I'll just give you a big fat kiss."

President Trump went on: "There is something nice, I don't have to be locked up in my basement. And I wouldn't allow that to happen anyway. I wouldn't allow it to happen. When you're the president you can't lock yourself in a basement. You've got to get out, and it's risky. It's risky but you've got to get out.

"But it does give you a good feeling when you beat something and they say you're immune, I don't know for how long, some people say for life, some people say for four months. Every time I hear about it it gets shorter and shorter and shorter, because they want it to be as bad as possible."

description: > 
  Southwest Airlines will no longer limit the number of seats for sale on each flight, joining rivals American and United.The new policy, which means middle seats will once again be filled on flights with strong demand, takes effect Dec. 1, after Thanksgiving but ahead of the Christmas and New Year's travel season.The airline has limited the number of seats for sale for months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, wooing skittish travelers.American and United have been filling flights for months, with United executives calling blocked middle seats a marketing ploy rather than a safety measure."Today, aligned with science-based findings from trusted medical and aviation organizations, we will resume selling all available seats for travel beginning December 1, 2020.''

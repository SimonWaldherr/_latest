Kylie Jenner spared no expense for Cardi B’s birthday over the weekend, jetting off to Las Vegas for the rapper’s blowout bash and presenting the “WAP” rapper with a pale blue Hermès Birkin bag.

“Look at this Birkin. Thank you, Kylie Jenner!” Cardi, who turned 28 on Sunday, shared on her Instagram Story. “Bing Bylie! She goes by King Kylie, but you know we’ve gotta B, B, B. Powder blue. I know I’ve got a bathing suit that can match this s—t.”

The Grammy winner captioned the clip, “Omggg Thank you @kyliejenner haaannn rockin it tomoorrraaa.”

Birkins in Cardi’s “blue jean” shade can retail for anywhere from $11,000 to over $25,000.

And her party might as well have been Hermès-themed; Cardi also unwrapped a mint green Kelly bag from her friends at Fashion Nova, and paired a hot pink bikini with a rainbow-striped “Sunrise” Birkin worth a cool $38,450 for the afterparty in her hotel suite.

Other famous guests at the rapper’s fête reportedly included her “WAP” collaborator Megan Thee Stallion, 21 Savage, Floyd Mayweather, Meek Mill, The Weeknd — and Cardi’s estranged husband Offset, whom she was spotted kissing.

<div><p>In the quiet of a late summer night, the artist is at work. Sumi-e, the art of Japanese ink painting, is equal parts beauty and discipline.</p><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/17/ffe6d878-e99c-4d52-872a-e6798e42fa6a/thumbnail/620x350/a83d2dd031fee34dff7d4155fc71bf53/david-lee-roth-artist-620.jpg#" alt="david-lee-roth-artist-620.jpg " height="350" width="620" class=" lazyload"></span><p class="embed__caption">David Lee Roth, artist.</p>

              <p>"You're a night owl &#8211; you usually paint and draw at night?" asked correspondent Tracy Smith. </p><p>"Yes, nighttime," replied the artist. "There's no magic to that. It's simple lack of visual stimulation."</p><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/17/3a0b02ed-4a51-481f-bf34-464b72deb7ad/thumbnail/620x350/d2808d0d07dd45dcd4bb5cd19b287614/david-lee-roth-sagaru-620.jpg#" alt="david-lee-roth-sagaru-620.jpg " height="350" width="620" class=" lazyload"></span><p class="embed__caption">"Sagaru," an example of Japanese sumi-e painting by David Lee Roth.&#160;</p>

              <p>And while you may not be familiar with the sumi-e technique, there's a good chance you've already met the artist in another life.</p><p>For rock music fans, David Lee Roth needs no introduction. As the original lead singer of the Hall of Fame supergroup Van Halen, he was "Diamond Dave" on stage &#8211; a human cyclone of crazy energy. &#160;</p><p>But the heart of the band was co-founder Eddie Van Halen, who died of cancer earlier this month at age 65, and who was arguably one of the greatest guitarists who ever lived.</p><p>David Lee Roth performed with Van Halen for the last time in 2015, and shortly after Eddie's death posted this tweet: "What a long great trip it's been."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What a Long Great Trip It&#8217;s Been.. <a href="https://t.co/lfTcxwRSaT" rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/lfTcxwRSaT</a></p>&#8212; David Lee Roth (@DavidLeeRoth) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidLeeRoth/status/1314267353849294850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

  <p>These days, at home in California during the pandemic, Roth's artistry is a bit more nuanced. But it didn't come easy; in fact, he spent two years in Tokyo trying to master this technique. &#160;</p><p>Roth said, "I spent the first six months painting bamboo because it was in spring/summer. And I said, 'When are we gonna paint something else?' And he looked out the window and said, 'When the weather changes.' And he wasn't kidding. So, for about four months we painted a little house with snow on top."</p><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/17/1a52dc8a-b1ac-42a9-844c-701aff6cfd88/thumbnail/620x657/020d14b23a24019d70f81a1033dc562f/david-lee-roth-brutal-city-620.jpg#" alt="david-lee-roth-brutal-city-620.jpg " height="657" width="620"></span><p class="embed__caption">"Brutal City."</p>

              <p>Smith said, "This is fascinating &#8211; you took two years of your life and went to Tokyo to study Japanese painting and drawing?"</p><p>"You have a look that is a bit, 'That's unusual'? 'Unexpected'?"</p><p>"Both?"</p><p>"Is it unexpected good, or unexpected eccentric to you? I'm curious."</p><p>"I think a little bit of both," Smith said. "I think it takes remarkable patience and discipline that most people, let alone a rock star who could be doing a lot of other things, would take the time to do."</p><p>Roth said, "If you were a rock star and you had the money to do &#8211; let's just add that &#8211; to do whatever it is, and I beyond all, I've always wanted a giant boat. If you can get past that, what would you use your rock stardom for?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>"I've always used my celebrity as a passport for travel, and let's go get into it."</p><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/17/980c3739-215a-4e90-8b1d-621d033608cd/thumbnail/620x612/d56ffd66ce859fabe9f446c15d50fdad/david-lee-roth-art-and-struggle-620.jpg#" alt="david-lee-roth-art-and-struggle-620.jpg " height="612" width="620" class=" lazyload"></span><p class="embed__caption">"Art and Struggle."</p>

              <p>And here's something else he got into: In 2004, Roth became a certified emergency medical technician in New York City. He was 48 years old, but he said answering life-and-death emergency calls in the Bronx was the thing in life that made him feel, well, like a rock star.</p><p>"I wasn't someone until I put on that 511 uniform and went on my first calls," Roth said. "I'm not gonna kid ya'. I knew I was in for the humbling experience: 'Oh, White boy rock star thinks what, this is an easy gig?'"</p><p>"But you wanted to do it anyway?"</p><p>"Oh, that's extra. You bet." </p><p>He also learned that in a crisis it helps to have a little sense of humor. "That is your only weapon; that is your only life preserver that you can give somebody who thinks they're gonna die," Roth said. "Nobody calls 911 just to wish you Happy Hanukah."</p><p>These days, it seems his time as a paramedic is behind him. But Roth is still very much a performer. Before COVID he'd been touring as a successful solo act.&#160;</p><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/17/a1fff45d-bace-4dbd-af9f-c270bb1eb61a/thumbnail/620x350/1891e5550e425e56d467889bc18cef40/david-lee-roth-on-stage-620.jpg#" alt="david-lee-roth-on-stage-620.jpg " height="350" width="620" class=" lazyload"></span><p class="embed__caption">David Lee Roth performs on stage.&#160;</p>

              <p>But now, he said, he's going to take it a little slower.</p><p>"So, you're gonna space it out a little bit," asked Smith. </p><p>"I'm on my, what, 45th year, something like that?" Roth said. "It's great to see me, but not every year. Like family!" </p><p>And for now, there's only his solitary art.

              <p>He asked, "Who has the most impact on history? Government? Or the historian?"</p><p>"He who tells the story, right?" said Smith. </p><p>"Hello! That's Yiddish for 'Yo!'"</p><p>"So, is your visual art, storytelling?"</p><p>"My visual art is complaining," he said. "It's graphic therapy.

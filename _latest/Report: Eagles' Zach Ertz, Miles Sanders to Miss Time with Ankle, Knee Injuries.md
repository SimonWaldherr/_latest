description: > 
  Chris Szagola/Associated PressPhiladelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz is expected to miss three to four weeks with an ankle injury, while running back Miles Sanders will miss at least Thursday's game against the New York Giants with a knee injury, according to Chris Mortensen of ESPN.Sanders came out of Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a knee injury after totaling 118 rushing yards on nine carries.He has at least 80 rushing yards in four of his five appearances, although injuries continue to hold him back.Sanders has 434 rushing yards on 6.1 yards per attempt, but the Eagles will once again have to play without him in Week 7 and potentially longer.Losing Ertz and Sanders puts Philadelphia in an even tougher spot as the team tries to overcome its slow start to the season.

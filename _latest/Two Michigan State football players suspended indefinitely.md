He is not permitted to travel out of state or have any direct or indirect contact with the alleged victim, according to online court files.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fulton&#8217;s attorney, Mike Nichols, said charges were reduced to assault and battery, and he is hopeful Fulton will be granted Holmes Youthful Trainee Act status. In Michigan, offenders younger than 24 who have pleaded to some criminal offenses can have their court records closed to public view under HYTA.

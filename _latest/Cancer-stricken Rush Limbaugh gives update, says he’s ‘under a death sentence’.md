<div><p>Cancer-stricken talk radio legend Rush Limbaugh provided listeners a somber update on his condition Monday after recent scans showed &#8220;some progression of cancer,&#8221; which he said is &#8220;not dramatic&#8221; but still a step in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Limbaugh announced in February that he was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and had missed several shows this month to undergo treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the moment you get the diagnosis, there&#8217;s a part of you every day, OK, that&#8217;s it, life&#8217;s over, you just don&#8217;t know when,&#8221; Limbaugh said. &#8220;So, during the period of time after the diagnosis, you do what you can to prolong life, do what you can to prolong a happy life. You measure a happy life against whatever medication it takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Limbaugh, who recently hosted President Trump for a two-hour interview, continued the devastating update on his diagnosis.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough to realize that the days where I do not think I&#8217;m under a death sentence are over,&#8221; Limbaugh continued. &#8220;Now, we all are, is the point. We all know that we&#8217;re going to die at some point, but when you have a terminal disease diagnosis that has a time frame to it, then that puts a different psychological and even physical awareness to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conservative radio icon then explained that he received bad news earlier this month during treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scans did show some progression of cancer. Now, prior to that, the scans had shown that we had rendered the cancer dormant. That&#8217;s my phrase for it. We had stopped the growth. It had been reduced, and it had become manageable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s always the reality and the knowledge that that can change and it can come back because it is cancer. It eventually outsmarts pretty much everything you throw at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Limbaugh said that his treatment program has been adjusted with chemotherapy drugs &#8220;in hopes of keeping additional progression at bay for as long as possible,&#8221; but he&#8217;s happy to be on the air while he can still do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very blessed to be here speaking with you today. Some days are harder than others. I do get fatigued now. I do get very, very tired now. I&#8217;m not gonna mislead you about that. But I am extremely grateful to be able to come here to the studio and to maintain as much normalcy as possible &#8212; and it&#8217;s still true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know, I wake up every day and thank God that I did. I go to bed every night praying I&#8217;m gonna wake up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Limbaugh said he understand many listeners are going through their own struggles and offered advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone told me &#8212; I think this is good advice, may be helpful &#8212; the only thing that any of us are certain of is right now, today. That&#8217;s why I thank God every morning when I wake up,&#8221; he said. I thank God that I did. I try to make it the best day I can no matter what. I don&#8217;t look too far ahead. I certainly don&#8217;t look too far back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Limbaugh told listeners he never thought he would make it to Oct. 1 when he was first diagnosed earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of immense value, strength, confidence, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m able to remain fully committed to the idea that what is supposed to happen will happen when it&#8217;s meant to. There&#8217;s some comfort in knowing that some things are not in our hands,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of fear associated with that, too, but there is some comfort. It&#8217;s helpful &#8230; God, is it helpful. It&#8217;s helpful to be able to trust and to believe in a higher plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Limbaugh received the Presidential Medal of Freedom during Trump&#8217;s State of the Union address only a few days after first informing listeners of his diagnosis.</p>

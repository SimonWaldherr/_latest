<div><p>At last night's press conference, Jurgen Klopp was asked by a journalist, whose credentials for being present he later&#160; snippily questioned, whether, and I paraphrase, he felt Liverpool stood any chance of coping with Ajax in the absence of Thiago Alcantara and 'Virgil van Dijk. He smiled, delivered a Paddington Bear stare, exhaled and said: 'No.' Then he said, 'But we will try' failing to mask the exasperation before asking whether the man in question, who had greeted him with a cheery 'Evening, Klopp', was actually a journalist at all.&#160;</p>
<p>One can understand his frustration but it is one that has been triggered since Saturday by a relentless focus on what Van Dijk's absence heralds. I would respectfully suggest that, though resources are thin at centre-half, Matip and Gomez are fine players, Fabinho looks at home there even if it wastes his vital midfield contributions, Wijnaldum looks OK in there and I think Milner could also play there alongside Matip. They wouldn't rule the air but then the team&#160;would have to adapt and ensure the wingers and full-backs stopped crosses.&#160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think Gomez is closer to Van Dijk's standard than Adrian is to Alisson's. The goalkeeper is the biggest miss and his return is vital to their chances of retaining the title and going deep in this competition.&#160;</p>
<p>Liverpool's defensive form has been sketchy even with Van Dijk in the side but Ajax, for all their promise, have been patch too. I saw their 2-1 victory over Vitesse and thought they lacked the old fluency and Groningen beat them 1-0 before their return to form in Sunday's 5-1 victory over Heerenveen. I'm glad they bought Davy Klaassen back. He's got such vision and thought he was ill-served by Ronald Koeman at Everton who inexplicably bought 'the Cheese Straw' as well as Gylfi Sigurdsson and Wayne Rooney for one position back in 2017 and favoured the other two.&#160;</p>
<p>For all Klaassen's graft and guile and the outstanding talent of Ryan Gravenberch in the midfield pivot role, Liverpool ought to have too much firepower and quality for Ajax's remodelled defence, if they can play with the ruthlessness and composure they exhibited against Chelsea.&#160;</p>
<p>We'll have the team news at 7pm.&#160;</p>

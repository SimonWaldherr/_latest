<div><p>Only the over-50s believe the BBC is too Left-wing, the corporation&#8217;s chairman has suggested, as he said perceptions of political impartiality are age-related.</p>
<p>Sir David Clementi said younger people tend to believe that the BBC is too Right-wing and part of the Establishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a general trend. We do a lot of impartiality surveys and they show that about a quarter of our audience think we lean to the Left, and slightly less - but nevertheless a very substantial number - think we lean to the Right. But the interesting thing about it is that it&#8217;s very age-related,&#8221; Sir David said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you get over 50, there are a significant number of people who are convinced that we all live in Islington and we all, you know, whatever. They&#8217;re convinced of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you speak to a younger generation, they occasionally think we&#8217;re part of the Establishment and we lean to the Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir David recalled giving a speech to students in Salford shortly after December&#8217;s general election. Afterwards &#8220;six or seven young students came up to me to berate me on the BBC&#8217;s performance in the election, which they said had been so heavily biased towards the Conservatives, they couldn&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to the Voice of the Listener and Viewer autumn conference, Sir David went on: &#8220;There is a very big, age-related issue around the matter of impartiality, we take it seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the great majority of our output we are very good but [director-general] Tim Davie has made this his priority number one and we are doubling down on impartiality.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one of his final public appearances before he steps down in February, Sir David took the opportunity to hit back at politicians who criticise the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find that too many of the people I talk to with very strong views about the BBC don&#8217;t spend too much time with the BBC. They get up with Today, they go to bed with Newsnight and they don&#8217;t watch much in between,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Of critics who want to see the licence fee scrapped in favour of a Netflix-style subscription, he said: &#8220;I have no doubt that the BBC could thrive as a subscription model, but it would not be the BBC that the nation knows and values.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who promote - and there are a lot of them - the notion of a subscription services brush aside these points. They rarely grapple with the technical problems, they do not explain how radio is to be paid for, they don&#8217;t engage with the commercial reality of a subscription service, nor do they point out to the public the types of investment, programmes and services that would be lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their argument is largely ideological&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sir David said that US streaming giants have plenty of entertaining content &#8220;but in terms of &#8216;inform&#8217; and &#8216;educate&#8217;, as well as &#8216;entertain&#8217;, the BBC reigns supreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked to name the biggest challenge of his chairmanship, Sir David said that charging the over-75s for their licence fees was &#8220;the most difficult decision we&#8217;ve had to take&#8221;.</p>

<p>Senate Republicans are throwing cold water on approving a multitrillion-dollar stimulus deal as President Donald Trump calls for a larger coronavirus relief package from Democrats.</p><p>Negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have crawled along, with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-stimulus-pelosi-mnuchin-white-house-coronavirus-deadline-2020-10">another conversation scheduled for Tuesday</a>, the deadline that the speaker set to make a deal before the election.</p><p>Democrats and the Trump administration would <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-democrats-stimulus-disagreements-pelosi-trump-mcconnell-aid-bill-differences-2020-10">still have to bridge significant differences</a> on major issues like cost, federal unemployment benefits, and tax credits. The White House <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosisenate-republicans-white-house-stimulus-offer-2020-10">has proposed $1.8 trillion</a> in further relief spending, while House Democrats <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/house-democrats-stimulus-plan-congress-unemployment-economy-pass-vote-bill-2020-9">passed a $2.2 trillion economic aid package</a> earlier this month.</p><p>But some Senate Republicans have said few are inclined to back a huge spending bill even if it has Trump's blessing. Any stimulus legislation with the support of all 47 Democratic-voting senators would require 13 Republicans to join them to pass it.</p>

John Hoeven of North Dakota <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/politics/republican-reaction-stimulus-negotiations/index.html">told CNN</a> on Monday.</p>

<p>Trump said again on Tuesday that he would be willing to support a package larger than $2.2 trillion.</p><p>"I would be willing to go more," he said in a Fox News phone interview.

<p>Senate Republicans are moving in the opposite direction and may be on a collision course with Trump.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has rejected spending the amounts under consideration and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-stimulus-package-coronavirus-relief-compromise-white-house-democrats-2020-10">suggested last week</a> that he wouldn't put a deal on the floor for a vote. He said on Saturday that the Senate would "consider" a bipartisan relief bill, without elaborating.</p><p>Senators are set to vote on Tuesday on renewing the Paycheck Protection Program to aid small businesses, then on a $500 billion economic aid bill on Wednesday. Democrats are likely to reject both as insufficient piecemeal measures.</p><p>There is substantial public support for a sizable government rescue package. In a <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/us101520-crosstabs1/016bc5d8ae03038c/full.pdf">New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday</a>, 72% of respondents said they would back a $2 trillion federal relief plan to extend enhanced unemployment insurance, send additional stimulus checks to Americans, and provide aid to state and local governments. Only 21% said they would oppose it.</p>

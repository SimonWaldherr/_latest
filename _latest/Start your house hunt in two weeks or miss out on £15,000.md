  Homebuyers should start their house search by November 1 or risk losing £15,000 in stamp duty savings, experts have warned.The homebuying process is becoming increasingly mired in delays that mean sales will drag on well beyond the stamp duty deadline at the end of March if purchasers do not move fast.Buyers with more complex requirements (mortgage applications for self-employed buyers now often come with extra requirements, for example,) should allow 17 weeks to buy a home, L&G said.Homeowners should enter the market within the next two weeks to be sure of benefiting from the tax holiday, L&G said.In July, Chancellor Rishi Sunak temporarily raised the nil-rate stamp duty band in England and Northern Ireland from £125,000 to £500,000, meaning buyers can save up to £15,000 if they complete a purchase before March 31 2021.

<div><p>Homebuyers should start their house search by November 1 or risk losing <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/200000-people-miss-stamp-duty-holiday-surge-demand-creates-bottleneck/">&#163;15,000 in stamp duty savings</a>, experts have warned.</p>
<p>The homebuying process is becoming <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/mortgage-wait-times-soaring-putting-homebuyers-risk-losing/">increasingly mired in delays</a> that mean sales will drag on well beyond the stamp duty deadline at the end of March if purchasers do not move fast.</p>
<p>According to research by Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, which is involved in nearly a fifth of all British mortgage transactions, it now takes at least 15 weeks to buy a home from start to finish.</p>
<p>Buyers with more complex requirements (mortgage applications for self-employed buyers now often come with extra requirements, for example,) should allow 17 weeks to buy a home, L&amp;G said.</p>
<p>But these wait times do not take the Christmas holiday into account &#8211;&#160;or the possibility of a &#8220;circuit-breaker&#8221; lockdown, like the one&#160;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/second-lockdown-would-mean-house-prices-could-housing-market/">announced in Wales</a>.</p>
<p>Homeowners should enter the market within the next two weeks to be sure of benefiting from the tax holiday, L&amp;G said.</p>
<p>In July, Chancellor Rishi Sunak temporarily raised the nil-rate stamp duty band in England and Northern Ireland from &#163;125,000 to &#163;500,000, meaning buyers can save up to &#163;15,000 if they complete a purchase before March 31 2021.</p>
<p>A surge in demand&#160;has pushed up prices and overwhelmed mortgage lenders, surveyors and conveyancers, who already had a backlog of sales&#160;following the market shutdown. Many have also seen their processing capacity reduced due to social distancing measures and working from home.</p>

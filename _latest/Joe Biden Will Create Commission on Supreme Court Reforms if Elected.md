  Joe Biden Will Create Commission on Supreme Court Reforms if Elected 
description: > 
  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he'll create a national commission to look into Supreme Court reforms if he's elected, saying the group would study options "well beyond" expanding the number of justices on the bench amid pressure from both sides of the aisle to define his views on "court packing."The former vice president has previously said he's "not a fan" of expanding the Supreme Court but has been mostly mum on the issue.While he didn't completely shut the door on court expansion, Biden said his commission is "not about court packing" and indicated that the group would consider a number of other reforms that could reshape the Supreme Court process."The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football â€“ whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want," Biden said.Supreme court justices stay for generations."

The former vice president has previously said he's "not a fan" of expanding the Supreme Court but has been mostly mum on the issue. At an ABC News town hall last week, Biden appeared open to the reform &#8211; particularly if Republicans confirm Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett prior to the election &#8211; and said he'd give his position on it before Nov. 3.</p><p>While he didn't completely shut the door on court expansion, Biden said his commission is "not about court packing" and indicated that the group would consider a number of other reforms that could reshape the Supreme Court process.</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Cartoons on the 2020 Election</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/31c62b1/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fdf%2F6d%2F21f364ca4cd183065abbc59893ea%2F20201019edsuc-a.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>"If elected, what I will do is put together a national commission &#8211; a bipartisan commission &#8211; of scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, liberal, conservative, and I will ask them to, over 180 days, [to] come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it's getting out of whack &#8211; the way in which it's being handled and it's not about court packing," Biden told CBS' Norah O'Donnell in a preview of a "60 Minutes" interview that'll air on Sunday.</p><p>When O'Donnell pressed him on whether the commission would specifically study court packing, Biden said that his group would look into "whether there's a number of alternatives that &#8230; go well beyond packing." </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football &#8211; whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want," Biden said. "Presidents come and go. Supreme court justices stay for generations."</p><p>The issue of court packing has gained momentum among more Democrats in the wake of Republicans' expedited process to confirm Barrett to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat just days before the presidential election. Democrats have called the process a "sham" and have urged Republicans to hold off on a confirmation since voting is already underway. Some Democrats have suggested adding more justices to the court if Republicans push through Barrett's nomination. </p><p>President <a href="//www.usnews.com/elections/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> and his allies have attacked Biden for previously punting on giving a stance on "court packing" and have lamented that Democrats want to change the rules if Barrett is confirmed and conservatives expand their court majority to 6-3.</p><p>Barrett's nomination is expected to be advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday with the full Senate scheduled to vote on her confirmation on Monday, just eight days out from the election.<br></p></div>

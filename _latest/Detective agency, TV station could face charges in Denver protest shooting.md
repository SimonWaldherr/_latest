The detective agency for which accused Denver “Patriot Rally” shooter Matthew Dolloff worked as a sub-contractor and the TV station that hired him for security work could face legal action for employing the unlicensed man, according to reports.

The City’s Attorney’s Office and the city department that handles licensing are deciding what punishment, if any, should be imposed against the involved parties, The Denver Post reported.

“Licensed security guard employers that hire unlicensed security guards could face disciplinary actions against their licenses ranging from a fine to suspension to revocation,” the city attorney’s office said in a statement.

“Businesses could also face criminal charges for permitting or directing an unlicensed person to perform security services. Regarding Matthew Dolloff, there could be civil or criminal actions taken, or both, against Mr. Dolloff, Pinkerton, 9News, and/or any other entity that hired and deployed Dolloff in an unlicensed security guard capacity,” it added.

The Pinkerton detective agency on Monday said that Dolloff worked for a contractor and was not directly employed by the company.

Meanwhile, 9News-TV said it had contracted Dolloff through Pinkerton and that it had enlisted security “for a number of months” to protect employees while covering Black Lives Matter protests and related rallies.

The Denver Department of Excise and Licenses has confirmed that Dolloff did not have an active security guard license at the time of the shooting, according to CBS Denver.

On Monday afternoon, 9News released a statement saying it “continues to cooperate fully with law enforcement and is deeply saddened by this loss of life.”

It added: “For the past few months, it has been the practice of 9NEWS to contract private security, through an outside firm, to accompany our personnel covering protests.

“Pinkerton, the private security firm, is responsible for ensuring its guards or those it contracts with are appropriately licensed. 9News does not contract directly with individual security personnel,” it said.

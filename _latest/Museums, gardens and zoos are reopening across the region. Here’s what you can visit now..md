<div><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md ">If you&#8217;re looking to get the kids out of the house for a few hours, or just spend an afternoon enjoying art in the open air, one of these museums or historic homes could be the answer. Remember to check websites and social media, as some attractions are operating with shortened hours, and not all exhibits may be open.</p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><i>This list will be updated as more institutions announce their plans.</i></p><p></p><p><h3 class="font--subhead gray-darkest ma-0 pb-sm pt-lgmod">Fully reopened</h3></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><a href="http://avam.org/stuff-everyone-asks/hours-and-directions.shtml" target="_blank"><b>American Visionary Art Museum</b></a>: The eccentric Baltimore museum, which champions the art of everyday people with more passion than training, reopened Sept. 25 after more than six months of closure. Capacity is limited to fifty percent, which means only 400 visitors per day can take advantage of the timed tickets. (Advance purchase is required.) All galleries are open, and a new exhibition called &#8220;The Science and Mystery of Sleep&#8221; &#8212; featuring &#8220;fantastical, handmade bedrooms created by three visionary artists as personal refuge&#8221; according to the museum &#8212; opens Oct. 10. <i>Open Wednesday to Sunday. $9.95-$15.95. </i></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><a href="https://www.dc.artechouse.com/" target="_blank"><b>Artechouse</b></a>: Melding interactive art with cutting-edge technology, Artechouse is a much different experience than the museums a few blocks away on the Mall. Its latest exhibit, &#8220;Crystalline,&#8221; which opened Oct. 15, is an homage to Pantone 19-4052 Classic Blue, which the Pantone Color Institute dubbed 2020&#8242;s color of the year. Artechouse says this particular shade &#8220;brings a sense of peace and tranquility to the human spirit,&#8221; with the exhibit taking the form of &#8220;an exploration through an illusory, blue-hued castle.&#8221; Capacity is limited, and timed-admission tickets are required. <i>Open daily. $17-$24; $5 discount for advance purchases.</i></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><a href="http://www.borail.org/" target="_blank"><b>B&amp;O Railroad Museum</b></a>: A museum known for hands-on activities, including actual train rides on the historic One Mile Express, might not be the first place you think of going right now, but Baltimore&#8217;s B&amp;O Railroad Museum is working hard to keep the facility safe. Masks and social distancing are required, including limiting seating and arranging spacing on the train. The children&#8217;s area is &#8220;cleaned throughout the day and is deep-cleaned each night,&#8221; while high-touch areas are cleaned multiple times a day. <i>Open daily. $12-$20.</i></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><a href="https://welcome.cbmm.org/" target="_blank"><b>Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum</b></a>: If you&#8217;re planning a day trip to St. Michaels or the Eastern Shore, the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum has reopened. There are some modifications &#8212; visitors can only enter the first floor of the restored 1879 lighthouse, and the interactive Sail the Seas exhibit is closed &#8212; but many of the attractions at the parklike museum, such as Waterman&#8217;s Wharf and the display of historic ships, is open as usual. <i>Open daily. $4-$14.

(The museum now recommends a minimum of two hours to explore.) Many of the interactive elements have been modified to reduce contact, but some elements are temporarily closed &#8212; including the sections in which visitors crawl through an air duct, and attempt to escape East Berlin by hiding in a Trabant. However, staff members have created alternatives in the space: The Trabant on display has a mannequin demonstrating the contortions needed to fit into a hidden space in the car. <i>Open daily. $16.95-$24.95.

For its reopening, the Kreeger is welcoming visitors to its galleries for four 50-minute timed-entry slots per day, beginning at 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., and limiting capacity to no more than 15 people per hour.

(The Virtual Reality Tour of the Lands of the Bible and the hands-on children&#8217;s area are closed.) Procedures to limit contact are in effect: Visitors will receive styluses to use with touch screens, and are asked to download museum maps to their phones instead of picking up paper copies.

Some amenities, such as the Imax theater and the observation tower, will be closed for social distancing requirements, and portions of the museum are closed for repairs to the roof. Still, many highlights, such as the space shuttle Discovery, are on view as usual. Masks are required for visitors aged 6 and older. Free, timed-entry passes are required for entry, and can be reserved through the Smithsonian&#8217;s website up to 30 days in advance. <i>Open daily.

It&#8217;s going to be even tougher now, as only 250 timed-entry tickets will be available each day. Free tickets can be reserved on the Smithsonian&#8217;s website up to 30 days in advance. For social distancing reasons, mask-wearing visitors will follow one-way paths through the museum, and some exhibits, including the segregated Southern Railway Car and Edisto Island Slave Cabin, will remain closed. <i>Open Wednesday to Saturday.

Most of the museum is open as usual, with only a few exhibitions, such as the hands-on Spark!Lab and Places of Invention, closed. (The full list of what&#8217;s open is <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/visit" target="_blank">on the museum website</a>.) American History has different hours than some other Smithsonian Museums, open Friday to Tuesday instead of Wednesday to Sunday, which is worth remembering if you&#8217;re trying to visit several museums in the same day. Timed admission passes are required, and visitors will enter the museum on the Constitution Avenue side and exit onto the Mall. <i>Open Friday to Tuesday.

A new pop-up exhibition, &#8220;Return to Nature,&#8221; draws inspiration from &#8220;humankind&#8217;s yearning to experience the outside world, particularly after a period of confinement,&#8221; making it particularly relatable right now. New procedures include limiting the use of elevators to one family or group at a time, and moving all maps and guides, including the interactive &#8220;See for Yourself&#8221; cards, online. Tickets should be purchased in advance; Admission remains free on Community Days, held on the first and third Sundays of the month. <i>Open daily. $8-$10; Ages 18 and younger admitted free. </i></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="absolute z-0">AD</p><p class=""></p><p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md "><a href="https://www.si.edu/visit" target="_blank"><b>National Portrait Gallery and Smithsonian American Art Museum</b></a>: The two museums share the historic Patent Office Building, so a single free timed-admission pass allows access to both collections. (Visitors must use the entrance at Eighth and G streets NW, as the F Street entrance is closed.) New exhibitions include &#8220;<a href="https://npg.si.edu/exhibition/her-story-century-women-writers" target="_blank">Her Story: A Century of Women Writers</a>&#8221; at the Portrait Gallery, and &#8220;<a href="https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/cars-and-art" target="_blank">The Automobile and American Art</a>&#8221; at American Art.

Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not helpful for planners: Timed tickets are made available at 10 a.m. each day on <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/ticket/234635/ticket/193" target="_blank">recreation.gov</a>, and are only good for visits on the following day.

However, no more than eight people can ride together in the elevator to the top. Note that the monument is closed daily between 1 and 2 p.m. for cleaning, and the last tour begins at 4 p.m. <i>Open daily.

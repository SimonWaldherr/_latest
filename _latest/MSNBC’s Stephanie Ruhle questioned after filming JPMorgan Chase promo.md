<div><p>MSNBC senior business reporter Stephanie Ruhle filmed promotional segments for JPMorgan Chase, a bank she covers &#8212; raising questions of potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Ruhle, the weekday &#8220;MSNBC Live&#8221; anchor, joined ESPN&#8217;s Jay Williams in a six-minute Chase video focusing on financial planning around the COVID-19 pandemic, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Chase/status/1308412755200925696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1308412755200925696%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_0&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fmedia%2F521052-chase-bank-to-stop-using-msnbcs-ruhle-in-promotional-ads-after-conflict-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sept. 22 tweet</a> from the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sat down with @Chase and @realjaywilliams to chat about planning for life&#8217;s unpredictable moments&#8230;something many of us are experiencing right now,&#8221; Ruhle <a href="https://twitter.com/SRuhle/status/1310623457307230208?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> days later, sharing the clip. &#8220;Tune in to see the full conversation &#8212; you won&#8217;t want to miss it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the longer segment, which has been made private on the bank&#8217;s YouTube, she offers bank-friendly advice like, &#8220;Saving is always the answer&#8221; and, &#8220;Please save as much as you can. And plan ahead,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/msnbcs-stephanie-ruhle-filmed-promotional-spots-for-jpmorgan-chase--one-of-the-banks-she-covers-as-a-journalist/2020/10/14/e7951562-0da2-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> reported.</p>
<p>The anchor denied involvement with the bank when questioned by The Post, the paper reported, referring any further questions to MSNBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not doing any work on behalf of Chase Bank,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you are referring to.&#8221;</p>
<p>An MSNBC spokesperson stressed that Ruhle was not paid for the appearance or compensated in any way and that she didn&#8217;t promote the bank. NBC and MSNBC journalists are not permitted to be paid for such engagements, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As is a common practice for journalists, Stephanie participated in an interview as a subject matter expert,&#8221; the network spokesperson said in a statement. &#8220;The issue was not the interview, but the way Chase promoted and framed it across social media. Chase has since recognized and corrected their mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman Trish Wexler <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/521052-chase-bank-to-stop-using-msnbcs-ruhle-in-promotional-ads-after-conflict-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told The Hill</a>&#160;that the company will no longer feature her promotional videos after concern has grown over her over impartiality.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was not paid for this financial literacy content. It was our mistake to promote it, and we&#8217;re sorry,&#8221; Wexler told the outlet.</p>

Tony Blair was last night accused of a “flagrant” breach of Covid-19 restrictions, after failing to self-isolate for a fortnight after a two-day trip to the US on a private jet.

In pictures obtained by this newspaper, the former prime minister is seen leaving a restaurant in Mayfair 10 days after his return from Washington DC last month.

The Sunday Telegraph understands that Mr Blair appealed to Whitehall ­officials for special dispensation from the Covid-19 rules, but that he was not issued with the formal exemption letter he would have needed to avoid the 14-day isolation period.

The Telegraph is not aware of any other exemption for which Mr Blair could qualify. He claims he was advised to follow rules on attending “international conferences”, having travelled to the US for a ceremony at the White House at which Israel signed agreements establishing formal relations with Bahrain and the UAE.

But the “international conferences” exemption to the rules applies to ­diplomats, staff at international bodies such as the UN and formal representatives at international conferences who have been “granted privileges and immunities”.

Mr Blair is considered a private ­citizen, having stepped down from his post-No 10 role as Middle East envoy in 2015.

Those taking advantage of the exemption require “an exemption letter to show at the border”.

A spokesman for the former prime minister said he was invited by the US government because of the role he played in the agreement between Israel and the UAE – describing the ceremony as a “diplomatic conference”.

The spokesman also insisted Mr Blair “posed no risk to anyone” as he was tested before his departure, on arrival at the White House, and again several times since returning to the UK.

Mr Blair has been a vocal advocate of an airport testing regime to cut quarantine times. The spokesman added: “We believe he followed all UK and US ­government guidelines as advised.”

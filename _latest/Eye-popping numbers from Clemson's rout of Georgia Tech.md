Clemson's 73-7 win over Georgia Tech on Saturday was a historically lopsided affair. The No. 1 Tigers entered halftime with a 52-7 lead and it didn't get much prettier for the Yellow Jackets despite Clemson sitting its starters late in the game.

Trevor Lawrence, the Heisman favorite and projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft, was in typical form despite throwing an interception for the first time since Oct. 19, 2019. Wideout Amari Rodgers was the beneficiary of Lawrence's arm and hauled in six catches for 161 yards and two touchdowns to lead Clemson.

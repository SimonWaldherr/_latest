When one all-time great salutes another all-time great, you know it's serious. It's even better when you can laugh at yourself in the process.

Tom Brady tweeted his praise for LeBron James one day after the Los Angeles Lakers star won his fourth NBA championship. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback also took a jab at himself with a meme about his fourth-down confusion last week.

Tweeted Brady: "Congrats to my brother @KingJames on winning his 4th championship. Not bad for a washed up old guy!" along with an edited picture of James' head on Brady's body during the moment of the quarterback's mistake in Thursday's loss to the Chicago Bears.

James, 35, led the Lakers to their 17th title Sunday, his fourth overall with three different teams. Brady, 43, won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots and is now leading a new-look Buccaneers team in his 21st season as a pro.

Not bad for two old guys.

  Six clever ways to keep cut flowers alive 
description: > 
  Bacteria create slimy stem ends that make the vase water stink.The old wivesâ€™ tale recommends that you add an aspirin, or half a glass of lemonade, to your cut flower water.Aspirin contains salicylic acid; lemonade contains sugar and citric acid.The sugar feeds the flowers, but in my view, it feeds the bugs too.In our experiments at Perch Hill it seems to add to the vase life of sweet peas, but nothing else.

<div><p>It should contain some bleach or an acidifying agent, such as vinegar or lemon juice. The bleach or vinegar reduce the proliferation of bacteria.</p>
<p>Tap water is alkaline, which is ideal for many bacteria. By adding a weak acid, you create a hostile environment for the bugs. Bacteria create slimy stem ends that make the vase water stink. It also blocks stems and prevents them from taking up water.</p>
<h3>3. Make your own flower food</h3>
<p>In a 30cm (1ft) tall vase, use one teaspoon of bleach or a good slurp &#8211; about five tablespoons &#8211; of cheap clear malt vinegar. The old wives&#8217; tale recommends that you add an aspirin, or half a glass of lemonade, to your cut flower water.</p>
<p>Aspirin contains salicylic acid; lemonade contains sugar and citric acid. And bubbles are created by carbon dioxide, which forms dilute carbonic acid in water.</p>
<p>Proprietary flower food also includes sugar. The sugar feeds the flowers, but in my view, it feeds the bugs too. In our experiments at Perch Hill it seems to add to the vase life of sweet peas, but nothing else.</p>
<p>I always put a drop of bleach in water with strong-smelling plants such as alliums, cleomes and any brassicas, to prevent their characteristic pong from developing.</p>

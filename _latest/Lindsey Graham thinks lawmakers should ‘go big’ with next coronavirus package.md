<div><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham thinks lawmakers should &#8220;go big&#8221; with the next coronavirus stimulus package &#8212; but disagrees with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s $2.2 trillion proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some Republicans who don&#8217;t want to spend anymore. I disagree,&#8221; Graham said in a pre-recorded interview on &#8220;Full Court Press with Greta Van Susteren&#8221; that aired Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we need more money,&#8221; he added, &#8220;but we don&#8217;t need policy provisions like the House has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The $2.2 trillion coming out of the House has a mandate for ballot harvesting. What&#8217;s that got to do COVID?&#8221; Graham said. &#8220;And the $1,200 payment, which I support, doesn&#8217;t require a Social Security number to get it, so a lot of the money would go to illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The South Carolina Republican said there&#8217;s a consensus on setting up a Paycheck Protection Program to allow small businesses to get a forgivable loan. He also noted there&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;common ground&#8221; on helping out schools.</p>
<p>But Graham said that he while was &#8220;willing to do some unemployment,&#8221; he disagreed with renewing the $600 weekly aid that expired July 31, arguing that &#8220;you&#8217;re paying people more not to work than work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelosi on Sunday <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/pelosi-gives-white-house-48-hours-to-agree-to-stimulus-deal/">gave the White House 48 hours</a> to reach a deal on a new relief bill &#8212; saying otherwise Congress will not be able to pass the relief before the November election.</p>
<p>Graham&#8217;s comments also came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/senate-to-vote-on-skinny-covid-19-relief-bill-and-ppp-funds/">announced Saturday</a> that he will put forward a $500 billion bill to be voted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The &#8220;skinny&#8221; bill, which doesn&#8217;t include a new batch of COVID-19 relief checks, would provide funds for schools and health care, liability protections, small-business spending and enhanced unemployment insurance lower than the $600 weekly, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/18/pelosi-stimulus-economy-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Other Senate Republicans have expressed opposition to the hefty spending Pelosi has sought.</p>
<p>But McConnell has said that should Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reach a deal, &#8220;the Senate would of course consider it.&#8221;</p>

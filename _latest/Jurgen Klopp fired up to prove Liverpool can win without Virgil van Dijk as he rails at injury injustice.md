  Jurgen Klopp fired up to prove Liverpool can win without Virgil van Dijk as he rails at injury injustice 
description: > 
  It will be the first test of how Liverpool players have reacted to losing Van Dijk, with Gini Wijnaldum revealing that some had been given sleepless nights after Pickford’s challenge.In this case Michael Oliver didn’t see and he is an excellent referee usually, but why he didn’t see it?“It’s really hard for us because Virgil is our boy and it has nothing to do with the quality of Virgil,” he said.“Yes, we went into the season with three centre-halves plus Fabinho as cover plus young kids as cover,” he said.As a football club it is difficult to have four world-class centre-halves – it is pretty expensive and one of them doesn't play for a long, long time.

<div><p>With Joel Matip also picking up an injury against Everton, it will mean Fabinho dropping back from midfield <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/20/liverpools-virgil-van-dijk-cover-options-short-term-fixes-youth/">to form a makeshift defence against Ajax</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>It will be the first test of how Liverpool players have reacted to losing Van Dijk, with Gini Wijnaldum revealing that some had been <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/20/georginio-wijnaldum-calls-jordan-pickfords-merseyside-derby/">given sleepless nights after Pickford&#8217;s challenge</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Klopp&#8217;s anger came from the recklessness of Everton's challenges. The Pickford tackle also went to video-assistant referee David Coote <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/10/19/liverpool-unhappy-contradictory-explanations-handling-tackle/">and was still unpunished</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few things came together,&#8221; said Klopp. &#8220;Firstly, the ref doesn&#8217;t see it. In this case Michael Oliver didn&#8217;t see and he is an excellent referee usually, but why he didn&#8217;t see it?&#160;I don&#8217;t know because he had the best view. Then VAR forgets the rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t do anything wrong in the game. I don&#8217;t think we did anything since then. But still our players are still the ones who suffer. It doesn&#8217;t feel right and it is not easy to deal with these type of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Klopp was adamant that his view has nothing to do with losing one of his best players long-term and another for the trip to Holland, where his side start their European campaign at Johan Cruijff ArenA.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard for us because Virgil is our boy and it has nothing to do with the quality of Virgil,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Injuries happen in football. Very often in challenges but often both players just try to play the ball. That was not the case in these two challenges and it makes it so different and difficult to take.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last four years, if you look, we were the leader of the fair-play table. You don&#8217;t get anything for that, it is most often something to make a joke about that you are top of that table but not in the real table. We were pretty high in both tables which means you can play football without these types of challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Klopp&#8217;s siege mentality extended to him defending Liverpool&#8217;s transfer policy over the summer window when they did not strengthen their defence with a centre-back.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we went into the season with three centre-halves plus Fabinho as cover plus young kids as cover,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is usually quite a good number. As a football club it is difficult to have four world-class centre-halves &#8211; it is pretty expensive and one of them doesn't play for a long, long time.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone wants to tell us know we made a mistake in the transfer window, I think Jamie Carragher mentioned something, that is the reason why they don't do this job and do the other job. You cannot have the solutions before you have the problems.&#8221;</p>

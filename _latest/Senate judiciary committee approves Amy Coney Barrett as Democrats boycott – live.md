</p><p><strong>The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has fallen to its lowest level since the Covid-19 crisis began.</strong></p>
<p>Around 787,000 new &#8216;initial claims&#8217; for jobless support were filed last week. That&#8217;s the smallest increase since March, when the US economy began to lock down.</p>
<p>The previous week&#8217;s total has been revised down too, to 842,000 from 898,000 (these are the seasonally-adjusted numbers).</p>
<p>The dip below 800,000 is good news but the number remains historically high. Before the pandemic struck the US was averaging about 200,000 unemployment claims per week.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s number is particularly important because it overlaps with the Labor Department&#8217;s monthly survey of the jobs market. But that figure will not be released until 6 November, after the election.</p>

<p>Now, this is still an awful lot of people losing their jobs in a week - showing that the US labor market is still weak. But after months of elevated initial claims, the total has moved in the right direction.</p>
<p>The continuing claim total (those who have received at least two weeks of support), fell to 8.373m from 9.397m a week earlier. That could be due to people returning to the jobs market, or finding that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080114/help-my-unemployment-benefits-are-running-out.asp" class="u-underline">their entitlement has now run out.</a></p>

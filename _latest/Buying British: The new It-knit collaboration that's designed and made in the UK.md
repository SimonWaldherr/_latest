One upside of the past few months is the number of small British fashion labels that have negotiated their way through the challenges and found their businesses either holding steady or growing. A key lesson from the pandemic is that a web of global production hubs isn’t the only answer. Sometimes small and local is better. So this seems like a good moment to begin a love-in.

When I say British, I don’t just mean based and paying tax here, but manufacturing here. Believe it or not, there are still some notable clusters of craft and expertise and they deserve nurturing and cherishing. As Victoria Stapleton, founder of Brora, who has been closely involved with mills in Hawick, Scotland since she launched in 1993, says, “I strongly believe in ‘Made in Britain’ where possible, especially when particular products are done so well on these shores. The skills of some of our weavers, spinners and knitters have been handed down for generations. When you work closely with local suppliers, your relationships become collaborative, something that has been of huge significance this year.”

Robin Givens revealed that news of an upcoming biopic about her allegedly abusive ex husband Mike Tyson, 54, reopened old wounds.

'I felt this drop in the pit of my stomach and was like, 'Oh no, here we go again.' I felt like the world was crumbling again,' recalled the actress, 55, in an interview with People published Thursday

'The marriage was eight months of my life and yet [Mike is] still saying slanderous things on his podcast. He's not physically hitting me anymore, but it hurts almost as much.'

Tyson's impending biopic, which is currently in development, will star Jamie Foxx, 52, and will focus on the highs and lows of the controversial figure's lengthy career in the spotlight.

Mike and Robin became husband and wife in February of 1988, but the marriage was short lived and tumultuous.

At that time, Robin was 23-years-old and starring in the hit sitcom Head of the Class, while Mike, 21, was quickly earning prestige in the world of heavyweight boxing.

Robin divorced Mike in 1989 after just eight months of marriage because she claimed the boxer inflicted unspeakable abuse on her, both verbal and physical.

In her interview with People, the Riverdale star recalled allegedly receiving a threatening phone call from Tyson sometime after their divorce proceedings.

'I remember my ex-husband calling up and saying, 'I've decided I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to make your life so miserable you're going to slit your own throat die.''

Two decades after Robin bravely made her allegations against him, Mike confessed to talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he had 'socked [Robin] before,' but her claimed the abuse went both ways.

'She socked me before, as well. It was just that kind of relationship,' he said.

Although she is no longer legally attached to Tyson, Givens claimed that her ex husband has repeatedly 're-victimized her' by speaking ill of her publicly.

For example, Tyson has accused Givens of taking money from him and, most famously, he claimed to have caught her in bed with Academy Award winning actor Brad Pitt at some point in their relationship.

When People re-presented Robin with Tyson's outlandish allegation, the actress insisted that it is just 'not true.'

Prior to hitting it big in Hollywood, Pitt - now 56-years-old - appeared on Robin's show Head Of the Class, which ran from 1986 until 1991.

Despite Tyson's alleged campaign to 'make [her] life so miserable,' Givens has remained focused on her own healing process and moving past the trauma the relationship caused her.

'I kept going to Mass and yoga and just praying and hoping it would just all be okay in the end,' she told the outlet.

As she worked towards personal healing, Robin toyed with love and ended up welcoming two sons, Michael, now 28, and William, now 21.

'I have a really, really nice life now. I have children that I love,' she gushed.

Robin can now be seen on small screens everywhere in the hit CW television series Riverdale, which premiered in 2017 and is about to enter its fifth season.

'I've loved being Josie McCoy's mom on Riverdale, which has just been wonderful. I've gotten to do the spinoff, Katy Keene and I got to direct my first Lifetime movie, A Murderer to Remember, which aired last month.

'And I'll direct another one starting the end of this month for them,' she revealed.

Besides honing her craft on screen, Robin often dedicates her time to causes and organizations that provide support for victims of domestic violence, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

She also speaks publicly about her experience with abuse to women in conferences and events across the United States.

'My story was very public, but when I speak to women and I sit in shelters and I hold children, I realize that the details of our stories are the same. My story is your story. Your story is my story,' she concluded.

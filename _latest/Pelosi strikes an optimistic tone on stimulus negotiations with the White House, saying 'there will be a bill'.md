<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi struck a hopeful tone on stimulus negotiations with the White House, raising the prospects of a final deal.</p><p>"I'm optimistic. There will be a bill," the California Democrat <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/pelosi-is-optimistic-about-reaching-agreement-on-coronavirus-relief-94315077574?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma">said in an MSNBC interview</a>. "The question is, is it in time to pay the November rent &#8212; which is my goal &#8212; or is it going to be shortly thereafter and retroactive."</p><p>"I'm pretty happy. I think we have a prospect for an agreement," Pelosi said, adding it's "up to the president to convince people in his party."</p><p>Stimulus negotiations between Democrats and the Trump administration have lurched chaotically for the past three weeks. At one point, President Donald Trump abruptly ended the talks before restarting them only a few days later.</p>

<p>But any deal faces significant opposition from many Senate Republicans concerned about more deficit spending. "I can't find 13 votes," said GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who serves as majority whip. He was referring to the number of Republican votes needed to approve a deal if all 47 Democratic-voting senators backed it.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-white-house-stimulus-deal-republicans-democrats-before-election-2020-10">urged the White House against striking a deal</a> before the election as it could complicate their speedy timeline to approve Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-bill-democrats-block-skinny-gop-coronavirus-aid-unemployment-2020-10">Democrats blocked</a> a $500 billion GOP "skinny" coronavirus relief bill from advancing onto the Senate floor on Wednesday.

<p>White House chief of staff Mark Meadows declined to speculate whether there would be a vote before the election, but said the administration was attempting to reach an agreement quickly.&#160;</p><p>"I think anything gets harder the longer it takes, but now that we're 90 days into this it becomes really incumbent upon us to get something done and the American people are hurting," he told reporters on Capitol Hill.

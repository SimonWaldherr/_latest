<div><p>You&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to find Anthony Weiner on a ballot again.</p>
<p>The disgraced ex-congressman guaranteed in an interview on Monday that his comeback won&#8217;t extend to politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to be on the ballot anytime,&#8221; Weiner, 56, told NBC New York&#8217;s Andrew Siff.</p>
<p>The Post exclusively <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/14/disgraced-pol-anthony-weiner-is-ceo-at-a-broken-glass-factory/">reported last month</a> that the former Democratic pol had re-emerged as the CEO of a company that makes countertops out of broken glass.</p>
<p>Wearing a hard hat and face mask, Weiner &#8212; whose serial sexting cost him his political career and later <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/18/anthony-weiner-spotted-picking-up-food-after-prison-release/">sent him to prison</a> &#8212; took the outlet on a tour of IceStone&#8217;s factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and detailed how he&#8217;s changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an embodiment of the idea that people sometimes redefine themselves,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be judged by our worst moments,&#8221; Weiner added. &#8220;We want to be judged by whether we get up from those worst moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now a working stiff, Weiner &#8212; who <a href="https://nypost.com/2011/06/20/weiner-officially-resigns-after-dumpsters-are-parked-outside-his-dc-office/">quit his seat</a> in Congress after he accidentally tweeted a lewd crotch shot of himself &#8212; said he&#8217;s no longer on social media and has dropped &#8220;a lot of bad habits,&#8221; while taking things &#8220;one day at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two years after he left Congress, Weiner mounted a mayoral campaign that <a href="https://nypost.com/2013/09/11/sext-gal-crashes-weiners-party/">went down in flames</a> amid a second sexting scandal while he was still married to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin &#8212; a flub that revealed his use of the online alias &#8220;Carlos Danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about Mayor Bill de Blasio&#8217;s performance, Weiner said it&#8217;s a &#8220;tough job&#8221; but that he believes he would have been better in the office.</p>
<p>He also said that his ex-wife is still working with Clinton on a podcast &#8212; and brushed off suggestions that he&#8217;d had a hand in helping President Trump win the 2016 election.</p>
<p>During the presidential race, FBI agents seized Weiner&#8217;s laptop as part of that probe and found emails <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/10/28/new-clinton-emails-found-during-anthony-weiner-sexting-probe/">exchanged by Clinton and Abedin</a>.</p>
 
<p>Clinton later&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2016/11/12/clinton-blames-comeys-email-probe-for-her-defeat/">blamed her stunning loss</a> on then-FBI Director James Comey&#8217;s decision 11 days before the election to reopen an investigation into her use of a private computer while serving as secretary of state under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you lose the election&#8230; people come up with a lot of reasons,&#8221; Weiner said.</p>
<p>Abedin, 44, <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/05/19/huma-abedin-finally-files-for-divorce-from-anthony-weiner/">filed for divorce</a>&#160;in 2017 &#8212; the same day Weiner&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2017/05/19/anthony-weiner-sobs-to-judge-i-have-a-sickness-but-i-do-not-have-an-excuse/">pleaded guilty to sexting a 15-year-old girl,</a>&#160;capping his stunning fall from grace and landing him&#160;<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/17/anthony-weiner-released-from-prison-will-register-as-sex-offender/">a 21-month prison sentence.</a></p>
<p>Their divorce case&#160;<a href="https://pagesix.com/2018/01/10/huma-abedin-and-anthony-weiner-call-off-divorce/?_ga=2.220683546.307827266.1600082253-1124005803.1597340023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was withdrawn</a>&#160;from court &#8220;to reduce any impact of these proceedings on their child&#8221; and settled privately, their lawyers said.</p>

<p>British holidaymakers hoping to visit Cyprus this half term could be in for disappointment, as the country risks losing its travel corridor in Grant Shapps' update this afternoon. But Jamaica could be back on the 'green list', as could holidays in the Canaries.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Covid-19 case numbers have risen in the Mediterranean island nation. Yesterday, the country saw 127 cases, up from 51 this time last week and 21 the week before that.</p>
<p>The brings the number of cases per 100,000 over seven days up to 59.6&#160; &#8211; higher than the threshold of 20, after which a quarantine is considered by the UK Government. In Germany, cases are at 54.5 per 100,000 and Sweden is at 56.2.</p>
<p>Jamaica, however, could be in for a travel corridor as its cases drop to 15.8&#160;per 100,000. On August 31, daily cases in the Caribbean nation peaked at 244. Now they are at 71. There are also ongoing hopes that the Canaries could be given travel corridors; the UK set a precedent for this by announcing regional air bridges with the Portuguese islands of Madeira and the Azores back in August.</p>
<p>Grant Shapps is due to make an announcement on the UK&#8217;s travel red-list&#160;at 5pm. In recent weeks popular holiday destinations, including Italy, mainland Portugal and Turkey, have lost their travel corridors, meaning Britons arriving back in the UK need to go into a 14-day quarantine.&#160;</p>

Fortune magazine reported he attended his last board meetings that year and cited a witness who said he dozed and drooled during it, which raised the question about whether he was fit to run the company.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the concerns about his health, Redstone hung on to his chairmanship as long as possible. In June 2015, he told Vanity Fair in an email correspondence, 'You should know that I am never retiring!!!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later that year, the Wall Street Journal reported Redstone had suffered mini-strokes that made speaking difficult, although he remained mentally sharp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Redstone's death, which comes at a time the media landscape is enduring wrenching changes, thins the ranks of a group of media executives, including Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner, who changed the world of news and entertainment with the companies they built.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Redstone displayed a penchant for forcing out top executives, including Viacom President Frank Biondi; Mel Karmazin, the CEO of CBS; and Tom Freston, who was canned as CEO of Viacom after losing a deal to acquire the social media network MySpace to Murdoch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Asked in his last interview, in January 2014, with The Hollywood Reporter, about who might succeed him, Redstone exploded, 'I will not discuss succession.

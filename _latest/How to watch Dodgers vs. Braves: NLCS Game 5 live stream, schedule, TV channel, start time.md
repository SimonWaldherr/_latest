The Atlanta Braves are one win away from their first World Series berth since 1999, leading 3-1 in the National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

After getting blown out in Game 3, the Braves bounced back to beat Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers in Game 4, setting up Friday's Game 5 as the potential clincher. Marcell Ozuna hit two home runs Thursday in the 10-1 win and has 10 RBI in the Braves' nine postseason games.

With their backs against the wall, the Dodgers – who had the best record in baseball – are trying to fight off another playoff disappointment. Only 13 teams in baseball history have overcome a 3-1 deficit to win a best-of-seven series, mostly recently the Chicago Cubs in the 2016 World Series.

Rookie Dustin May (postseason: 4 ⅔ IP, 0 ER, 7 K) starts for the Dodgers with their season on the line. The 23-year-old right-hander had a 2.57 ERA in 56 innings in the regular season, mostly as a starter, but has been used out of the bullpen in two of his three appearances in the playoffs. He started Game 3 of the NLDS but only pitched the first inning.

The Braves will use their bullpen to piece together nine innings in Game 5, starting with left-hander A.J. Minter (postseason: 2⅓ IP, 1 ER). Minter becomes the first pitcher in MLB history to make his first career start in a postseason game. Dodgers leadoff hitter Mookie Betts hit just .200 against lefties this season and regular No. 2 hitter Corey Seager hits left-handed, so Minter getting the start looks like a matchup play for the first inning.

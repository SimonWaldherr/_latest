<div><p>Presidential candidate Joe Biden and running-mate Kamala Harris are taking all the help they can get in their campaign to defeat incumbent Donald Trump, including from non-humans.</p>
<p>In a unifying call, the Biden-Harris campaign posted a video on Saturday (aka Caturday) to bring together Democrats, Republicans, independents, and "Demo-cats" to help them get Trump out of the White House this election season.</p>

<p>The adorable cats in this video are described as volunteers. Are they truly effective electioneers? That hasn't been confirmed, but at the very least they will attract some eyeballs to Biden-Harris. It's hard not to appreciate their beauty.</p>
<p>But now here comes the real question: Can cats vote? Obviously, they would have to be at least 18 years old and a citizen of the United States. There is no language in the law that specifically says a citizen of the U.S. can't be a cat, so what we're working with here is an Air Bud situation. Technically, if a cat is registered as a citizen and 18 or older, it should be allowed to vote.</p>
<p>If all the cats over 18 in the U.S. are registered and vote for Biden-Harris, that could be a pretty sizable push for the Democrats.</p>
<p>By the way if you text "cat" to 30330, you don't get a picture of a cat or anything, they just ask you to sign up for the campaign. A bit of a missed opportunity.</p>

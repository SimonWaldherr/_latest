<p>As temperatures fall, people are spending more time indoors. That heightens the risk of the coronavirus spreading, but there are some simple steps you can take to help protect yourself and everyone around you.</p><p>It's easy to get tired of wearing masks and practicing social distancing. There has even been some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/14/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/">talk from the White House</a> about <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/06/trump-herd-immunity-scientists-426911">herd immunity</a> &#8212; the idea that if enough people get infected, the virus won't be able to spread.</p><p>But the US <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">isn't anywhere close</a> to herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2, estimated to be reached when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/tom-frieden-herd-immunity-wrong-solution-coronavirus/2020/10/16/acb4ae8a-0fe6-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html">about 60%</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808">to 70% of the population</a> has been infected &#8212; likely more than 200 million people. Without a vaccine, hospitals would be overwhelmed by the illnesses and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html">hundreds of thousands</a> <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">more people</a> <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---12-october-2020">would die</a>. We also don't know <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/10/13/science.abe5960">how long immunity lasts</a>.</p><p>Since we don't have an approved vaccine in widespread use yet, protective measures are still essential. As a nursing school dean, I recommend taking these seven simple steps to protect yourself and your loved ones and reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p><p></p><h2>Avoid crowds and keep some distance</h2><p>Avoid the <a href="https://www.who.int/images/default-source/wpro/countries/malaysia/infographics/three-3cs/final-avoid-the-3-cs-poster.jpg?sfvrsn=638335c1_2">3 C's</a> &#8212; closed, crowded, and close contact. This gets harder as the seasons change and more activities move indoors.</p>

<p>When people <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSPv04IJvpI&amp;feature=emb_logo">sing</a>, shout, or even just talk, they send tiny respiratory droplets into the air. If infected droplets get into your eyes, nose, or mouth, you can get infected. Staying six feet away is a good rule of thumb, but it doesn't protect you from everything. The tiniest of these droplets, <a href="https://theconversation.com/when-covid-19-superspreaders-are-talking-where-you-sit-in-the-room-matters-145966">known as aerosols</a>, can linger in the air for hours.</p><p>The risks of contracting COVID-19 increase in inadequately ventilated spaces where people spend long periods together in close proximity. Outbreaks have been linked to restaurants, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12751">choir practices</a>, fitness classes, nightclubs, and other spots where people congregate. You can still find ways to exercise outside, though. Try going for a walk with a friend. Virtual events can also bring people together safely.</p><h2>Wear a face mask</h2><p>Face masks can <a href="https://theconversation.com/covid-19-masks-faqs-how-can-cloth-stop-a-tiny-virus-whats-the-best-fabric-do-they-protect-the-wearer-146822">reduce the virus's spread</a> by stopping droplets people breathe out and filtering some of what they breathe in. They are especially important in crowded and poorly ventilated areas.</p><p>To wear the mask correctly, start by cleaning your hands before you put it on, and make sure the mask fits securely over your nose, mouth, and chin. When the mask doesn't cover your nose, you're giving the virus an easy route for infection.</p>

<p id="gpt-post-science-desktop_in_post_ad-fluid-3" class="ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop"></p>
<p>If you wear a fabric mask, make sure it has two or more layers.</p><h2>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth</h2><p>Your hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can then transfer the virus to your eyes, nose, or mouth. From there, the virus can infect you.</p><h2>Wash your hands</h2><p>Simply <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html">washing your hands</a> can reduce the spread of viruses. Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands for at least 20 seconds with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This eliminates germs, including viruses.</p><p>Fall and winter also bring more colds. When you feel the need to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good "respiratory hygiene," you protect the people around you from viruses, including those that cause the common cold, flu, and COVID-19.</p>

<h2>Keep surfaces clean</h2><p>Clean and disinfect surfaces in your home frequently, especially those people touch regularly, such as door handles, faucets, and phone screens.</p><h2>Recognize the symptoms</h2><p>Until the US has an approved vaccine with reliable immunity and it's being used, this pandemic remains a serious health threat. Being able to recognize the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">symptoms of COVID-19</a> is important.</p><p>Common symptoms of COVID-19 include, fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Other symptoms that may affect some patients include loss of taste or smell, aches and pains, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, red eyes, diarrhea, or skin rash.</p><p>Some of these symptoms overlap with the common cold, but it's best to err on the side of safety. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html">If you feel sick or have a fever and difficulty breathing</a>, call your doctor or hospital and seek help. If you experience less severe symptoms, self-isolate until you recover, even if the symptoms seem mild. Call your health care provider or see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/coronavirus-self-checker.html">Coronavirus Self-Checker</a> for additional support. If you need to leave your house, wear a face mask to avoid infecting others.</p>

<p>Keep up to date on COVID-19 information and risks from local and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/index.html">national health authorities</a>.</p><h2>Take care of your mental health</h2><p>During the stress and upheaval of the pandemic, don't forget to take care of your mental health and well-being.</p><p>Connecting with friends, loved ones and your community via social media, phone, video, or text can help reduce feelings of social isolation. Eating well, exercising daily, and <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need">getting enough sleep</a> are important for health and coping.</p><p>Be deliberate in making time to care for yourself by engaging in activities that bring you joy. Don't be afraid to ask for help or to seek out resources including counseling or therapy if you are feeling stressed. Practice positive self-talk by saying phrases out loud such as "This is temporary" and "We can do this."</p>

<div><p>When you've got a drippy nose or monster headache, chances are you head to your local pharmacy in search of relief. Endless over-the-counter treatment options await, sardine-packed on store shelves. For many of us, the which-product-should-I-buy decision is hardly more complex than a game of eeny, meeny, miney, mo. For some, it comes down to price. For others, it's brand loyalty (Mom always went with &#8230;). For others yet, it's whichever medication has the most convincing TV commercial. For most of us, it's a decision we make alone. But we don't have to. </p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Enter <a href="https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/pharmacist">pharmacists</a> &#8211; those white-coated, behind-the-counter individuals who, as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor, "dispense prescription medications to patients and offer advice on their safe use." Indeed, pharmacists must understand the complex composition of medicines, as well as the laws that regulate their manufacture and sale. They instruct patients on how and when to take a prescribed medicine, advise on potential side effects, and stay alert for the possibility of risky drug interactions. </p><p>But they have a lot to say about the products lining drugstore aisles, too. For 19 years, the industry trade publication Pharmacy Times has surveyed thousands of pharmacists nationwide to pinpoint their recommendations on a range of over-the-counter products. The results, published annually in its <a href="http://www.otcguide.net/" target="_blank">OTC Guide</a>, are then widely circulated to pharmacists throughout the country to help them guide consumers' shopping decisions. </p><p>And now you have the pharmacists' intel, too. </p><p>U.S. News, in collaboration with Pharmacy Times, presents <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs">Drugs &amp; Treatments</a>, a product aimed at getting those pharmacists' recommendations into your hands. Previously known as Top Recommended Health Products, Drugs &amp; Treatments is a natural extension of our continuous commitment to helping Americans make important health decisions, whether it's choosing a <a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals" title="Link: https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals">hospital</a>, <a href="https://health.usnews.com/top-doctors" title="Link: https://health.usnews.com/top-doctors">doctor</a>, <a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-diet" title="Link: https://health.usnews.com/best-diet">diet</a>&#160;or medication. U.S. News and Pharmacy Times have combed through pharmacists' survey responses to show how different brands stack up in more than 130 over-the-counter product categories, from <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-cough-suppressants">cough suppressants</a> and <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-headache-products">headache relief</a>, to <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-sleep-aids">sleep aids</a> and <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-antacids">antacids</a>. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>All this information is easily found on our <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs">website</a> in the section labeled "Over-the-Counter Drug &amp; Device Rankings." Here are the standout winners in 13 product groups defined by Pharmacy Times:</p><p><b>Cough, Cold and Allergy</b></p><p><b>Diabetes Health</b></p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p><b>Diagnostics</b></p><p><b>Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat&#160;</b></p><p><b>First Aid</b></p><p><b>Oral Care</b></p><p><b>Pain and Inflammation</b></p><p><b>Pediatrics</b></p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p><b>Stomach and GI</b></p><p><b>Topicals</b></p><p><b>Vitamins and Supplements</b></p><ul>
 <li> <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-multivitamins">Multivitamins</a>: Centrum</li>
 <li> <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-nutritional-supplements">Nutritional Supplements</a>: Ensure</li>
 <li> <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-prenatal-vitamins">Prenatal Vitamins</a>: One A Day Prenatal</li>
</ul><p><b>Women's Health</b></p><p><b>More Health Products</b></p><p>The full list of categories can be found <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings">here</a>. Click around to read the survey results. Some findings might surprise you. For example, when it comes to the numerous <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-sunscreen">sunscreen brands</a> on the market, 35% of&#160;the pharmacists surveyed preferred Neutrogena to Coppertone (20%) and other brands. Among <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-oral-antihistamines">oral antihistamines</a>, Zyrtec is the go-to, before Claritin, Allegra Allergy or any others. One a Day Prenatal wins in the <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-prenatal-vitamins">Prenatal Vitamins</a> category, Excedrin beats Advil and Tylenol for <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-headache-products">headache relief</a> and Abreva wins among <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs/rankings/top-rec-cold-sore-treatments">cold sore treatments</a> by a mile.</p><p>U.S. News displays all brands that received at least 1% of pharmacists' votes, but only products that garnered the most votes within a given category earned the "No. 1 Pharmacist Recommended" designation. In a few cases, this results in a tie.&#160;</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Note that you'll see the percentages rounded to whole numbers. Consequently, the sum of all product percentages in certain categories is sometimes 99% or 101%. Pharmacy Times handled rounding a little differently, and so some products differ by a percentage point between our website and the OTC Guide. </p><p>For both resources, it's important to note these pharmacist recommendations are based solely on brand-name products in cases where generics may be present. </p><p>We hope <a href="https://health.usnews.com/drugs">Drugs &amp; Treatments</a> will help make your next trip to the drugstore a little less mind-boggling. While you should always check package labels for ingredients, directions and warnings, this information is another resource when considering different brands. </p><p>When in doubt about how well a product will handle the job, step up to the counter and ask.<br></p></div>

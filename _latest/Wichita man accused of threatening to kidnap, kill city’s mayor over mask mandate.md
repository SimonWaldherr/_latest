A Wichita, Kansas man who hated his city’s face mask mandate was arrested Friday night for allegedly threatening to kidnap and murder the mayor, a report said.

Meredith Dowty, 59, was busted for the alleged threats against Wichita’s Mayor Brandon Whipple, the Kansas City Star reported.

Dowty, a popular local musician and retired city firefighter, texted the threat to another city official, the mayor told the Star.

“He said he was going to kidnap me and slash my throat,” the mayor alleged of Dowty.

“And he needed my address because I needed to see the hangman — me and everyone who — something about tyranny,” Whipple said.

Police confirmed Dowty’s arrest to the newspaper and said he could face a criminal threat charge.

“It sounded like the person was very upset about pretty much mask mandates and he said something about not being able to see his mother because of COVID restrictions on elderly homes,” Whipple said of Dowty.

“This wasn’t just some guy popping off on social media,” Whipple said.

“He contacted someone that knows where I live that apparently he thought would give him my address.”

Wichita’s mask ordinance, championed by the mayor, requires face coverings be worn in most public settings, the newspaper reported.

With the battle lines drawn over Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination, senators on Tuesday will begin to engage with her, looking for answers about her qualifications and legal views.

After a day of contrasting opening statements on Monday, in which Republicans hailed Judge Barrett’s credentials and Democrats warned that she would invalidate the Affordable Care Act, all 22 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee will have a chance to direct questions to the nominee for 30 minutes at a time.

The format could lead to a marathon day, with some senators asking questions remotely; Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic nominee for vice president, is participating by videoconference from her office on Capitol Hill, underscoring her party’s complaints about holding the hearing during the coronavirus pandemic.

Here is what to watch for on Tuesday as the lengthy first day of questioning begins.

Democrats will avoid impugning Judge Barrett’s character or faith.

Democrats are expected to focus more on the implications of confirming Judge Barrett than on criticizing her directly.

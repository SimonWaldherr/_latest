  Why 'blue on blue' Tory Covid row is more about old against new than South versus North 
description: > 
  As one comparative veteran Tory put it: "This is less about South versus North and more about old versus new."They might be new MPs, but some of them have been around the block a bit," said one former minister."If you've been a Tory party activist in, say, somewhere like Ashfield, you're used to putting up a fight."Ordinarily, a lot of these teething problems would be ironed out in the tearoom," said one MP elected in 2010.In a bid to bridge the gap, Downing Street has recently instructed the chief whip, Mark Spencer, to "love bomb" the newbies most at risk of turning into "serial rebels".

<div><p>As one comparative veteran Tory put it: "This is less about <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/15/london-placed-tougher-restrictions-fend-north-versus-south-row/">South versus North</a> and more about old versus new. I think there are some 'Red Wall' MPs who basically feel that they have not just been taken for granted but actually treated with a degree of contempt.</p>
<p>"They resent this arrogant 'shut up and be grateful you're in office' approach."</p>
<p>Although such imperious methods have been used on new arrivals since time immemorial, some have questioned the wisdom of trying to corral this particular group of MPs, who have not only fought tooth and nail to win long-held Labour seats but have also given up successful careers in the process.</p>
<p>"They might be new MPs, but some of them have been around the block a bit," said one former minister. "If you've been a Tory party activist in, say, somewhere like Ashfield, you're used to putting up a fight. These people aren't going to be pushed around."</p>
<p>Coronavirus has undoubtedly hindered the normal induction process that would have seen new MPs wined and dined at Downing Street and Chequers, formally introduced to the Queen and possibly even taken on a team-building "away day".&#160;</p>
<p>"Ordinarily, a lot of these teething problems would be ironed out in the tearoom," said one MP elected in 2010. "But that's not happened because of Covid."</p>
<p>In a bid to bridge the gap, Downing Street has recently instructed the chief whip, Mark Spencer, to "love bomb" the newbies most at risk of turning into "serial rebels". Mr Johnson has also instigated Wednesday night gatherings with small groups of backbenchers in an echo of Theresa May's "sandwich sessions" at the height of the Brexit revolt.</p>
<p>Yet with his leadership coming under ever greater scrutiny, some Tories are starting to question whether it's MPs who are having to sing for their supper &#8211; or <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/10/06/boris-johnson-gave-us-vision-future-anyone-actually-listening/">their embattled PM</a>.&#160;</p>

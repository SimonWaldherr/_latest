Amazon Prime Day 2020 will be a massive event when it kicks off on October 13 and 14. Buyers can expect great deals on products across all categories, including HD, 4K, and even 8K TVs.

If you've been searching for a brand-new 65-inch TV to watch your favorite shows, movies, and sports on, Prime Day could be the perfect time to snag a big-screen display at a nice discount. Smaller TVs and entry-level models ideal for bedrooms and casual buyers should also be on sale.

A few early TV deals are already available, including a $100 discount on a 43-inch Toshiba Fire TV Edition HDTV. Last year's Prime Day featured deals on Samsung's Q900 8K TVs, with models up to $3,000 off their regular prices. TCL's 5 Series 4K TV was also on sale for up to $300 off. We expect similar deals on more TV models for Prime Day 2020.

With that in mind, we've spotlighted a few TV models that will likely be on sale for Prime Day 2020, along with details on early deals you can take advantage of right now. We'll update this page with more Prime Day TV deals as soon as they go live.

Early Prime Day TV deals

Prime Day 2020 doesn't officially begin until next week, but Amazon is already offering a few early deals on select TVs. The early discounts listed below will be active until October 12 while supplies last.

As part of the early promotion, Prime members can snag a 43-inch Insignia Fire TV Edition 4K TV for $100 off its regular price. Though this model doesn't include any fancy picture quality features, like local dimming or Dolby Vision, the Insignia display does offer built-in support for Amazon's Fire TV streaming platform and basic HDR playback.

Meanwhile, buyers looking for a solid budget TV with a smaller screen size can get a 32-inch Toshiba Fire TV Edition HDTV for just $120. That's $60 off the display's regular price. The TV only has a 720p panel rather than 1080p or 4K, but at that screen size, the benefits of a higher resolution display would be hard to see.

When is Prime Day?

Amazon Prime Day 2020 will start on October 13 and deals will keep coming through October 14. We're anticipating various TV deals will go live throughout the two-day period, so be sure to check this page frequently for all the latest discounts.

Prime Day deals will only be available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you're not already a member, a Prime subscription costs $13 a month, or $120 a year if you pay for an annual plan. Prime memberships include several perks and benefits, like free two-day shipping on a ton of products, Prime video streaming, and more.

A free 30-day trial is available to new members. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can sign up now to test the service for free and enjoy all the Prime Day deals when they launch next week.

What Prime Day TV deals to expect

Specific Prime Day 2020 TV deals haven't been revealed yet, but Amazon has confirmed that customers will be able to "save up to 30% on select Samsung and Sony TVs" during the event. We'll have to wait until the sale begins to see exactly which models get discounted.

Based on last year's sale, however, it's likely that we'll see a nice assortment of HD, 4K, and 8K TV models in a variety of sizes. Amazon has partnered with several smart TV brands, including Insignia and Toshiba, to integrate its own Fire TV OS into select models. Some of these TVs are already on sale, and it's expected that more Fire TV Edition displays will be discounted on Prime Day.

Brand-new 2020 TV models from Sony, LG, Samsung, Hisense, TCL, and Vizio started rolling out to stores back in the spring and summer. Various deals have already been offered on some of these new sets during previous sales on Independence Day and Labor Day, so it's possible that Prime Day could see similar discounts on flagship and midrange 4K TVs.

A few 2019 TV models are still in stock as well, so it's also expected that Amazon will mark down some of these older displays in order to clear out inventory.

TV deals we saw last year

Last year's Prime Day sale featured deals on several TVs across different price ranges.

Some highlights included Samsung's Q900 8K TV lineup. The Q900 offers a whopping 8K resolution, and it's built with Samsung's QLED technology, so you'll get expanded colors and bright HDR performance. The TV ranges in size, but only the 55-inch model is currently in stock.

Samsung recently released three new 2020 8K TV models, the Q800T, Q900T, and Q950T, so it's possible that Prime Day 2020 will include discounts on these new displays instead.

On the much more affordable end of the spectrum, TCL's 2018 5 Series 4K Roku TV was up to $300 off on Prime Day last year. While that older model is no longer available, it's likely that the company's more recent 2019 5 Series or 2020 5 Series will be discounted for Prime Day instead. The 2019 5 Series TV is our pick for the best affordable 4K TV overall, and it features the Roku platform built-in for convenient streaming.

How to shop for a TV

TVs vary wildly in price, features, and size, so picking the right display for your needs can seem complicated. When it comes to budget models, you can frequently find smaller HDTVs for as little as $100. On the higher end, flagship 65-inch 4K TVs can cost $1,500 or more. The best 8K TVs can even go for more than $10,000 depending on how big the screen is.

If you're buying a TV with home theater performance as a priority, then you'll want to go for a 4K set with at least a 65-inch screen. The best 4K TVs feature an OLED panel, or an advanced LED panel with local dimming. These screen technologies will enable the highest contrast, deepest black levels, and brightest picture for impressive high dynamic range (HDR) playback.

For people who just want a no-fuss display and are less concerned about HDR, a smaller TV with a more affordable LED panel should be more than fine. Though image performance won't be as good as pricier TV models, there are plenty of solid budget LED TVs, including inexpensive models that still feature 4K resolution and convenient smart TV streaming capabilities.

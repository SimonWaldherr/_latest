<div><p>When Ben Freedman closed the Prince Charles Cinema on March 18, he thought that it might stay shut for a year. Given the speed of Covid-19&#8217;s onslaught, he bolted his doors four days before the Government ordered cinemas to do so, and proceeded on the assumption that the situation might extend into 2021.&#160;</p>
<p>Speaking on the phone, I suggest that this was a more realistic outlook than many cinema operators in Britain showed. &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; he laughs. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m married to a lawyer. You learn to think the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prince Charles, the only <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/can-independent-cinemas-survive-busy-came-boriss-statement/">independent cinema</a> in London&#8217;s West End, is notoriously unflappable. The building began life as a theatre in the 1960s, enjoyed a brief time as an adult (read: pornographic) cinema in the 1970s, then became a mainstream one in the 1980s before, in 1990, being bought by theatre producer Ben Freedman and his entrepreneur son, Ben.&#160;</p>
<p>It quickly became a cineaste&#8217;s nirvana, a snobbery-free cult haven showing second-run films, arthouse classics, all-night movie marathons and audience participation extravaganzas, from The Rocky Horror Picture Show to Sing-a-Long-a Sound Of Music. It is, according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/upon-time-hollywood-torture-porn-anti-woke-deserves-no-oscars/">Quentin Tarantino</a>, &#8220;everything an independent movie theatre should be&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The joy of the cinema is that we&#8217;ll basically show any film that&#8217;s legal and will fill the place,&#8221; Freedman explains. &#8220;And we just wanted to keep that alive and have a bit of fun at a time when everything was a bit miserable.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>When he closed the doors in March, he tried to take a measured approach to the future. The cinema had financial reserves, and prioritised its staff, not only determined to avoid&#160;redundancies but keeping them on full pay. A couple of weeks later, the Government&#8217;s furlough scheme made that easier, and the building&#8217;s landlord agreed to reducing the rent by half.&#160;</p>

<p><br><i>1. The governor&#8217;s order allows eviction filings to continue, but directs courts to stay proceedings and prevents court officers from dislodging tenants unless specifically directed by the court on a case-by-case basis.</i><br><i>2. Georgia courts have been granted discretion as to whether they take up eviction filings.</i><br><i>3. Michigan offers an <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mshda/0,4641,7-141-5555-533463--,00.html" target="_blank">Eviction Diversion Program</a></i> to help tenants pay back rent.<br><i>4. In New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming, eviction stays were ordered by courts rather than legislation or executive directive. Where dates are listed, courts decided to resume with eviction proceedings on the date indicated.</i><br></p></div>

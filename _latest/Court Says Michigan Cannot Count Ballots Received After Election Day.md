  Court Says Michigan Cannot Count Ballots Received After Election DayEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/APBallots received after 8 p.m. on Election Day in Michigan cannot be counted, an appeals court ruled on Friday â€” a reminder that election rules in many states remain in flux just over two weeks before the election.A lower court had previously ruled that ballots postmarked by Nov. 2 and received within 14 days of Election Day, the deadline for certifying election results, could be counted.It is not clear whether this latest decision will be appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court.Jocelyn Benson, the Michigan secretary of state, is now urging voters to mail ballots by Monday to ensure they arrive in time to be counted.An NPR analysis found that during primary elections this year, some 50,000 mail ballots were rejected because they arrived too late, often through no fault of the voter.

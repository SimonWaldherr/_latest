Michelle looked gorgeous in a print dress as she captioned the snap: 'Counting down the weeks #minibabyshower #sociallydistanced #mummiestobe.'

Proud Kate, who is a producer on Emmerdale, lovingly rested a hand on her wife's bump while the pair both wore 'mummy-to-be' sashes.

One of Michelle's followers guessed that the blue sashes may signal what gender the couple's baby is, but the actress soon corrected the fan, telling her: 'We don't know what we are having,' and adding in response to a further query about the blue sashes: 'They were white, must be the light.'

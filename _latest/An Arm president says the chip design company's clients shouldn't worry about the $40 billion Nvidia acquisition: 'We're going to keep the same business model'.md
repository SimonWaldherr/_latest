Rene Haas, president of Arm's intellectual property group, spent seven years as an executive at Nvidia, which has signed a $40 billion deal to acquire the chip design company.

He acknowledged that the pending merger has sparked concerns among Arm clients, including some of Nvidia's rivals.

But Haas told Business Insider: "We're going to keep the same business model. We're going to essentially ensure that everything that's worked for Arm for 30 years is going to stay the same. We're going to make the IP available to everyone. We're not going to bias it in any way."

As an Nvidia veteran has helped him give his Arm colleagues a better sense of what to expect in the pending merger, Haas said. "Nvidia is a fast moving company," he said. "They run really fast. They make really quick decisions."

Rene Haas, president of Arm's intellectual property group, spent seven years at tech giant Nvidia before joining the chip design company in 2013.

Now, Haas is getting ready to be reunited with former colleagues after Nvidia signed a $40 billion deal to buy the UK-based company from Softbank.

"It's actually pretty cool," Haas told Business Insider. "These are two great companies in terms of technology. I think it's a great combination. Culturally, the companies are really a good fit because they're both engineering-driven cultures with really smart people."

The merger is expected to create a formidable combination in a fast-changing tech landscape, even though the marriage faces major hurdles, including regulatory scrutiny and some anxiety among Arm's clients.

Arm became a tech powerhouse by designing power-efficient chips that became dominant in the mobile phone market. Its business model hinges on licensing its designs and other intellectual property to customers including Samsung, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and Apple, who actually go forward with the actual manufacturing of the chips.

While Arm made its name in smartphones, its designs are starting to show up in other arenas, led by the fast-growing data center market, challenging established players led by Intel and AMD. Nvidia, which has been dominant in the graphics chip industry, has also become a powerhouse in data centers, where it leads the market for processors used for AI technologies.

In a sign that the competition is heating up, AMD is reportedly in talks to acquire Xilinx in a $30 billion deal that would give it a boost in major chip markets, including data centers.

Many of Arm's customers are Nvidia's competitors

But the marriage, which has yet to be finalized, is grappling with a key hurdle: many of Arm's customers are Nvidia's competitors.

"There were a lot of rumors about the acquisitions and one of the biggest things that people were writing about was that this was going to be horrible," he said. "And the reason was gonna be horrible was that Nvidia was going to destroy the business model."

Arm has more than 500 licensees, including leading semiconductor makers such as Samsung, Qualcomm, and STMicro. Arm's designs are used in a wide variety of devices, including more than 95% of smartphones and 90% of wearable devices, the company said.

Arm's business model "largely stems around neutrality," Haas said: "It's a highly neutral platform, in terms of customer access, and that neutrality allows customers to not only feel that they're not being disadvantaged."

That's not going to change when Arm becomes part of Nvidia, he said.

"We're going to keep the same business model," he said. "We're going to essentially ensure that everything that's worked for Arm for 30 years is going to stay the same. We're going to make the IP available to everyone. We're not going to bias it in any way."

Haas said some of Arm's partners have also raised the question: "If you're part of Nvidia, how am I going to know that the information that I share with you will be kept confidential from Nvidia?"

Haas said that is the commitment Arm is making even after it becomes part of Nvidia. Details of how this system will be set up are still being worked out. But Haas said the arrangement would be similar to other mergers, such as when IBM boughtRedHator after Dell acquired VMwareas part of its merger with EMC.

"We're also going to be very careful about confidential information from customers," he said. "We're going to basically have firewalls between information that's inside of Arm."

A return to Nvidia

Haas, who served as vice president and general manager of Nvidia's computing products business, said being an Nvidia veteran has helped him give his Arm colleagues a better sense of what to expect in the pending merger. People in a company that's about to be bought can sometimes be uneasy about what the new owner would be like, he said. "You're trying to second guess. Can I really trust what they're telling me? Is this really what the culture is?"

"It's very easy for me," he said. "A lot of the same people who were there are still there. So, I feel very comfortable in any conversation I'm having with Nvidia folks. When I come back and talk to the Arm folks about, I have a high degree of confidence that I know how they think. I feel very fortunate. "

Haas cited one aspect of Nvidia's culture that the Arm organization should be aware of: speed.

"Nvidia is a fast moving company," he said. "They run really fast. They make really quick decisions."

That could potentially lead to misunderstandings and concerns that they are trying to rush decisions "because they've got some ulterior motive," he said. "And we come back and say, 'No, it's none of that,'" he said. "They're a pretty intellectually honest company. They just run really, really fast."

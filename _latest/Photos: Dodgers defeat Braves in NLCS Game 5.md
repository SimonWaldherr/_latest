The Dodgers kept their World Series hopes alive for at least another day with a 7-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, on Friday.

After falling behind early, the Dodgers surged into the lead in the sixth inning off a three-run home run by Will Smith. They extended the lead in the seventh off a two-run homer by Corey Seager — the shortstop’s second home run of the game.

Here are some of the best images of the game from longtime Los Angeles Times photographer Robert Gauthier.

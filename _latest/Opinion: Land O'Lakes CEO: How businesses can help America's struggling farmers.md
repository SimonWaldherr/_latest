Beth Ford is president and CEO of Land O'Lakes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

America's farmers are hopeful, but struggling.

This spring, massive supply chain and distribution disruptions caused by the shutdowns, combined with stockpiling by worried shoppers, decimated grocery stocks. Restaurants closed, leaving farmers and ranchers without a market for their livestock and crops. Then, this summer, wildfires, drought and severe storms impacted production of corn, peanuts, cotton and much more across the country.

Now, however, America's farmers face the added stress of trying to get their kids access to online school and their grandparents to the virtual doctor. But when your internet signal is weak, do you utilize what limited bandwidth you have for the tools that operate your farm or for your child to finish her math assignment? Or do neither of those things happen so grandma can see the doctor online? When you don't have reliable and fast digital connectivity, none of it happens.

It is vital to the families who own and operate more than 95% of America's farms to be connected.

Americans who don't have reliable access to the internet feel it when they are acting as teachers in their homes or trying to help their kids keep up with their studies. Roughly 16 million K-12 students and 400,000 public school teachers lack reliable access to the internet required for learning. They feel it when they need to go to the doctor, as telemedicine visits during the pandemic reach an all-time high and patients seek to avoid exposure at health care facilities. They feel it when they are trying to steward the land wisely as their parents did.

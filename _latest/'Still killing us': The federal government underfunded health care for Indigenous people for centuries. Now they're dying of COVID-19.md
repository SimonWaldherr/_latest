  'Still killing us': The federal government underfunded health care for Indigenous people for centuries. Now they're dying of COVID-19 
description: > 
  In town, the understaffed Gallup Indian Medical Center, run by the federal government’s Indian Health Service, was filled with cases.The federal government, which oversees health care for Native Americans under treaty obligations, had no pandemic plan.It was the direct result of centuries of systemic racism that has left McKinley County’s health care system chronically underfunded, understaffed, ill-equipped and outdated.Centuries after the United States traded land for health care and other services with sovereign, Native nations, federal officials spend nearly three times as much per person on non-Indian medical care than on health services for Indigenous people.In 1955, Indian Health Service began to oversee health care on tribal lands.

<div><p>In reservation areas of New Mexico, health care is underfunded. In this six-part series, USA TODAY investigates links between racism and COVID-19.</p><p class="dropcap">GALLUP, N.M. &#8212; Melvina Musket&#160;stared at her dying father through the cellphone screen.<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/10/12/coronavirus-deaths-reveal-systemic-racism-united-states/5770952002/" target="_blank"> His mouth hung open, his eyes were clamped shut&#160;</a>and a beard covered his chin. She heard nurses crying in the background.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Jesus is waiting for you,&#8221; she told him.</p><p>Musket, 52, had never seen her father with facial hair. Benjamin Musket, 80,&#160;was a former Marine, a retired machinery mechanic, a basketball coach and a board member at their church. He didn&#8217;t do beards.</p><p class="oembed-frame">

They didn&#8217;t shop at their local stores, where too many people neglected to wear masks, instead driving nearly five hours roundtrip to Albuquerque&#160;for groceries. When they returned home, they wiped down every purchase and took showers.&#160;</p><p>The novel coronavirus came all the same. One day in May, Benjamin Musket started coughing. Twelve hours later, he was gasping.&#160;</p><p>In town, the understaffed Gallup Indian Medical Center, run by the federal government&#8217;s Indian Health Service, was&#160;filled with cases. When the staff saw Benjamin Musket had a heart infection and COVID-19, they flew him to a hospital in Albuquerque, over 100 miles&#160;away. A few weeks later, he was dead.</p><p>In the days after Benjamin Musket became ill, nearly everyone in the family tested positive.</p><p>Melvina Musket was hospitalized with a high fever. The medical center staff put cold compresses under her arms to cool her down.</p><p>Her mother was admitted to a hospital in Albuquerque, where she fell into a nonresponsive fog. Melvina Musket&#8217;s brother begged the hospital staff: &#8220;I can&#8217;t lose my mom this week; I already lost my dad.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="ad-container tealplayer-ad-container"></p><p class="video-details title show-length">COVID deaths of Native Americans linked to limited access to resources and healthcare</p><p class="video-details caption">COVID ravaged McKinley County, where roughly 74% of the population is non-Hispanic Native American &#8212; mostly Navajo and Zuni &#8212; and access to resources is scarce.</p><p class="video-details attribution">USA TODAY</p><p>On June 11, their mother died, five days after her husband.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t even know how profoundly sick they were,&#8221; Melvina Musket said. &#8220;It was just too much for their bodies.&#8221;</p><p>Few places in the world have been as scarred by the coronavirus pandemic as McKinley County, New Mexico. By September, the county ranked first&#160;in the state and sixth&#160;nationally for COVID-19 deaths per capita.&#160;</p><p>Roughly 74%&#160;of <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/mckinleycountynewmexico" target="_blank">McKinley County&#8217;s 71,367&#160;residents </a>are non-Hispanic Native American, mostly Navajo&#160;and Zuni. The majority of land within the county&#8217;s borders is part of the Navajo Nation reservation. The Navajos,&#160;who call themselves Din&#233;,&#160;are descendants of people who outlived colonization, smallpox, massacres and resettlement. They take pride in a history of resilience.</p><p class="oembed-frame">
</p><p>Then came the Big Cough, or Dikos Ntsaa&#237;g&#237;&#237;-19, as coronavirus is known among Din&#233; tribal members.</p><p>The federal government, which oversees health care for Native Americans under treaty obligations, had no pandemic plan. And as the COVID-19 crisis began to overwhelm the community, medical experts and others say&#160;federal authorities were slow to respond, a judgment call that cost lives and fueled the spread.</p><p>This failure was no accident, experts said. It was&#160;the direct result of centuries of systemic racism that has left McKinley County&#8217;s health care system chronically underfunded, understaffed, ill-equipped and outdated. And all in a community grappling with multigenerational housing, preexisting medical conditions, substance abuse and poverty, where many live without running water, electricity&#160;or enough food for their daily nutritional needs.</p>

An emergency room and intubation tents&#160;were set up in the parking lot. Mothers in labor were diverted to other hospitals to make room for coronavirus patients.</p><p>As the federal facility filled up, some overflow patients went to the one private hospital in the area, which also was overcrowded, prompting nurses and doctors at one point to protest in the street against unsafe conditions.

Surrounding reservations prohibit alcohol. With bars set to shut down,<strong> </strong>Foley said,&#160;tribal members came to drink in Gallup, home to more liquor stores per capita than just about any place in the nation.</p><h1 class="cta-headline">Help support quality journalism like this.</h1><a class="uw-btn" href="https://offers.usatoday.com/digitaloffer?gps-source=CUSTOMCTARIGHTRAIL&amp;itm_campaign=STORYTELLING&amp;itm_content=CUSTOMCTARIGHTRAIL&amp;itm_medium=inDepth&amp;itm_source=storytellingStudio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subscribe</a><h1 class="cta-headline">Get news and insights sent to your inbox.

The 1868&#160;Treaty between the United States of America and the Navajo Tribe of Indians allowed the Din&#233; to return to only a portion of their ancestral homelands. The exchange was one of hundreds of American Indian treaties that have been ratified since 1778.</p><p>From the start, government officials refused to honor it.&#160;</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, the federal government passed legislation to terminate its legal obligations to tribes and launch an assimilation policy with Native peoples&#160;moving away from reservations and perceived dependence. In 1955, Indian Health Service began to oversee health care on tribal lands.</p><p>Two decades later, Congress reversed course, abandoning the assimilation model. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Act recognized tribal sovereignty and enabled Native&#160;nations to run their own hospitals, schools, police departments and other programs, funded by the federal government.

      </p><p>&#8220;A lot of our solutions are within ourselves, within our communities,&#8221; said Lee, pointing, for example, to an intertribal quarantine site United Natives co-created as part of COVID-19 relief. &#8220;But what if we have the knowledge without any resources?"</p><p>Other volunteers from across the United States stepped in to make up for the lack of health care.&#160;</p><p>Doctors and nurses from the University of California-San Francisco, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, New Mexico&#8217;s Medical Reserve Corps, the state&#8217;s National Guard and elsewhere rushed to McKinley County to bolster medical staff and deliver supplies.&#160;</p><p>Gary Morsch, an emergency doctor from Olathe, Kansas,&#160;recognized the pandemic threat early and founded a nonprofit known as COVID Care Force.&#160;After bringing volunteer medical workers to New York City in early April, <strong>&#160;</strong>the former Army physician shifted to Gallup and Shiprock later in the month. Morsch said his teams filled in for doctors and nurses at Gallup Indian Medical Center who were sick or quarantined, helped remaining staffers who were exhausted and monitored patients in motels and nursing homes.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;It was tough &#8211; busy, busy, busy,&#8221; Morsch said, referring to conditions at the Indian Medical Center. &#8220;Every room was full.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>As money and resources arrived, the Navajo Nation and New Mexico adopted get-tough policies to enforce lockdowns and pandemic protections. Gallup was locked down May 1, with roads leading into town closed and nonessential businesses shuttered for 10 days. In the first two weeks of May, Navajo police issued nearly 500&#160;citations to curfew violators, according to The Arizona Republic.&#160;&#160;</p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/10/13/USAT/f9f7cabe-eb23-4f3a-bd98-d40724fd9cdf-XXX__JC38711.JPG?width=7" alt="A sign on the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation in Smith Lake, N.M., warns people to protect their families during the coronavirus pandemic."><p class="image-zoom__modal-trigger"></p><p class="in-depth-image-caption-container">A sign on the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation in Smith Lake, N.M., warns people to protect their families during the coronavirus pandemic.<p class="in-depth-image-credit">Jasper Colt, USA TODAY</p></p><p>But, in recent weeks, cases have&#160;increased on and surrounding Navajo Nation land.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Our health care system on the Navajo Nation cannot handle another large surge in cases,&#8221; Nez said in an Oct. 3 press release.</p><p>And for many families, the Big Cough has already wrought its destruction.</p><p>After Melvina Musket&#8217;s parents died, it wasn&#8217;t easy for family members to arrange a double funeral. There were so many deaths in McKinley County, the cemetery staff couldn&#8217;t immediately provide a date for the burial. As a safety precaution, there would be no service.</p><p>&#8220;None of the people at the funeral home wanted to touch him,&#8221; Musket said of her father.&#160;</p><p>When the time came, the family gathered at the Rehoboth Cemetery, a barren tableau of white crosses and sagebrush right outside Gallup. Only 10 mourners were allowed; other family and friends stood at the graveyard entrance, six feet apart and wearing masks.&#160;</p><p>In Navajo culture, when someone dies, there is a long wake where people gather, tell stories, eat, pray and make donations. But in light of COVID-19, that wasn&#8217;t possible. Musket placed onto the casket a small Bible her grandmother had given to her parents when they wed. The casket was covered with earth. Flowers were heaped on top.</p><p>Contributing: Mark Nichols, Jasper Colt</p><h2 class="chapter-marker-header">MORE IN THIS SERIES</h2><h1 class="cta-headline"></h1><a class="uw-btn" href="https://offers.usatoday.com/digitaloffer?gps-source=CUSTOMCTAFULLWIDTH&amp;itm_campaign=STORYTELLING&amp;itm_content=CUSTOMCTAFULLWIDTH&amp;itm_medium=inDepth&amp;itm_source=storytellingStudio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><h1 class="cta-headline">Get news and insights sent to your inbox.

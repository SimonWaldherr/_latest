<div><p class="teal-video-wrap"></p><p class="gnt_em_vt"></p><p class="gnt_em_vb gnt_em_vb__te"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This time a week ago, as the San Francisco 49ers returned to team headquarters after a 43-17 throttling at the hands of the Miami Dolphins, Kyle Shanahan could sense anger and embarrassment from his players as they re-watched the debacle and then sought ways to put it behind them.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Rampant injuries had led to a rough start to the Super Bowl runner-up&#8217;s 2020 season, but the 49ers couldn&#8217;t even use poor health as an excuse in that loss in Miami. They had played terribly in just about every facet of the game.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That frustration continued to permeate throughout the locker room last week, and San Francisco&#8217;s players used it as fuel during their preparation for a crucial meeting with the NFC West-rival Los Angeles Rams. The payoff came in the form of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/49ers/2020/10/18/san-francisco-niners-los-angeles-rams-score-nfc-west/3707711001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">a 24-16 victory</a> that evened the 49ers&#8217; record at 3-3.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The victory came as no surprise to the 49ers. Players and coaches said&#160;that, given the sense of urgency and attention to detail they sensed on the practice field and in meetings last week, they held a strong belief they would win Sunday night.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">MORE:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/nate-davis/2020/10/18/nfl-week-6-32-things-we-learned-2020/3704177001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">32 things we learned from Week 6 of the 2020 NFL season</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">WINNERS, LOSERS:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2020/10/19/nfl-week-6-winners-losers-buccaneers-jets-adam-gase/3703389001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Bucs' defense shines, Adam Gase's Jets hit embarrassing low</a></p><img class="gnt_em_img_i" alt="San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle (85) celebrates after scoring a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams during the second quarter at Levi's Stadium."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd"></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Shanahan set the tone early on Sunday, orchestrating aggressive and diverse offensive attack that gave the 49ers a first-quarter lead they only built on. Shanahan&#8217;s unit rediscovered the recipe of balance that makes the offense click at its best. San Francisco&#8217;s defense followed suit and held a potent Rams offense to just two touchdowns while recording one takeaway (a Jason Verrett interception in the end zone).</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A .500 record with 11 games left on the schedule isn&#8217;t cause for celebration, but the victory did carry great significance, as San Francisco took steps toward regaining its offensive identity while seeing numerous defensive players step up for injured starters.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Just getting back to the brand of football we know we're capable of playing," defensive lineman Arik Armstead told reporters Sunday. "Running the ball, moving the chains, taking the life out of a defense, and then on defense, big stops, three-and-outs, eliminating explosives, making them drive all the way down the field to beat us. I think we just got back to playing like we know how to play."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And of equal importance, San Francisco avoided falling further behind the 5-0 Seattle Seahawks, 4-2 Rams and 3-2 Arizona Cardinals.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Injuries struck yet again, bringing more uncertainty as the team awaits word on running back Raheem Mostert, center Ben Garland and safety Jaquiski Tartt.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">But on Sunday, San Francisco&#8217;s players could at least take comfort in the fact that they had pulled off a potentially season-saving victory.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They hope that such a win, and the contributions that made it possible, will help provide much-needed momentum as they embark on a stretch that features road games against New England, Seattle, Green Bay, New Orleans&#160;and the Rams, as well as&#160;home games against Green Bay and Buffalo.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Shanahan deserves credit for pushing the right buttons and getting his team to respond to last week&#8217;s blowout loss with an effective performance against the Rams. So, too, do the locker room leaders who echoed the coaching staff&#8217;s message.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;Whenever guys are holding each other or themselves accountable, it&#8217;s a good thing,&#8221; said quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, who rebounded from a two-interception showing against Miami while still recovering from a high-ankle sprain&#160;to throw for three touchdown passes against Los Angeles. &#8220;The NFL is hard. Not every week is going to be fun or pretty. When the captains have the mindset and set the tone, it trickles down to everyone else.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Given the 49ers' rash of injuries and the fashion in which they lost to the Dolphins, a Week 6 loss to the Rams, who entered the game having won two straight and four of their last five, wouldn&#8217;t have surprised anyone. But instead, San Francisco delivered while exhibiting strong mental fortitude, which Shanahan and Co. knew would be necessary this season.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The 49ers understand that they&#8217;re in the midst of one of pro football&#8217;s toughest tests. Whether the Super Bowl hangover is mythical or real, teams that lose in the NFL&#8217;s championship game often seem to encounter some kind of very real adversity in their quests for redemption.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Only eight teams in NFL history have returned to the Super Bowl the year after losing, and many runner-ups struggle just to make it to the playoffs the following year.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Health concerns seemingly will test the 49ers&#8217; ability to contend for a Lombardi Trophy this season. Until the team returns as close to full force as possible, the roster's depth will be challenged.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Shanahan and general manager John Lynch have worked to fortify their corewith smart drafts and free agency classes, and now they&#8217;re in the process of finding out how effective they have been in producing quality depth.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Meanwhile, San Francisco&#8217;s players understand this challenge is as much mental as it is physical. They also are aware that they must maintain the same type of steely focus going forward that they applied to their preparation for the Rams game, because they still have plenty of ground to make up.&#160;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">&#8220;This will give us a little momentum,&#8221; Garoppolo said. &#8220;But next week will be another dogfight.&#8221;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Follow USA TODAY Sports&#8217; Mike Jones on Twitter&#160;<a href="https://twitter.com/ByMikeJones" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">@ByMikeJones</a>&#160;and listen to&#160;the&#160;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-football-jones-podcast/id1472751609" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Football Jones podcast&#160;on iTunes.</a></p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em__lp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/sports/nfl/2020/09/11/nfl-fans-attending-games-during-2020-season/3463938001/"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" alt="" width="660" height="372"><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg"></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb"></p></a></div>

  Gareth Bale: Spanish media take shot at ex-Real Madrid star as Tottenham blow 3-0 lead 
description: > 
  Spanish media wasted no time taking aim at Gareth Bale and the 'curse' that follows the Welshman following his role in Tottenham's three-goal collapse against West Ham.Bale made his first appearance since rejoining Tottenham in a loan deal from Real Madrid this summer, coming off the bench for the last 20 minutes on Sunday with Jose Mourinho's side 3-0 up.'Tottenham were on track when Mourinho gave the fans the pleasure of Bale, who came on at 3-0.Unlike the Spanish press, Jose Mourinho was unwilling to pin the three-goal slide on returning hero Bale and his missed opportunity at 3-2.'It's a pity that he couldn't score that fourth goal which was a beauty and would have killed the game.

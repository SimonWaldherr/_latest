<div><p>Top CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter was ripped on Twitter on Tuesday for what critics called his side-stepping explanation of colleague Jeffrey Toobin&#8217;s <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/jeffrey-toobin-was-masturbating-in-front-of-new-yorker-bigs-report/">online-masturbation scandal.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Jeffrey Toobin has been sidelined at a pivotal moment in the run-up to the presidential election. The reason: He exposed himself during a Zoom call with New Yorker colleagues in what he says was an accident,&#8217;&#8217;<a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1318377113037189121"> tweeted Stelter,</a> host of the cable network&#8217;s show &#8220;Reliable Sources.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s our full story,&#8221; Stelter wrote, including a link to CNN&#8217;s take on Toobin&#8217;s alleged spectacularly icky moment on a Zoom call with notable New Yorker writers such as himself and WNYC public radio workers last week.</p>
<p>In addition to being a star staff writer at The New Yorker magazine, Toobin is CNN&#8217;s chief legal analyst.</p>
<p>Twitter user Irritated Furiosa <a href="https://twitter.com/kellybarnhill/status/1318597845805617160">fired back</a> at Stelter, &#8220;Except he didn&#8217;t accidentally jerk off during a work meeting; he just &#8216;accidentally&#8217; let people see it. During a work meeting. He *intentionally* jerked off during a work meeting. On the clock. While looking at his colleagues. THAT is the problem, not the &#8216;accidental&#8217; exposure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another user with the handle Trump is a Super-Spreader<a href="https://twitter.com/blueingreenemo/status/1318598890019500034"> added</a>, &#8220;Toobin was in a work situation. His behavior was completely inappropriate and borders on predatory. He needs to be more than side-lined. He should be fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toobin <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdgm4/new-yorker-suspends-jeffrey-toobin-for-zoom-dick-incident">admitted to the Web site Vice</a>, which first reported the seamy Zoom failure Monday, &#8220;I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believed I was not visible on Zoom. I thought no one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Toobin has since been suspended by The New Yorker and taken &#8220;leave&#8221; from CNN.</p>

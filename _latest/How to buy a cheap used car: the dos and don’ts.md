Buyers are still flocking to get their hands on affordable used cars so that they can avoid using public transport. But buying a cheap used car can be a daunting prospect and, particularly at the bargain basement end of the market, there are plenty of neglected, defective or downright dangerous cars around.

So how should you approach buying a cheap used car, especially if it’s your first time or haven’t done so for a log time? These dos and don’ts should help you to sort the wheat from the chaff.

DO

Get as much history about the car as you can

There’s no way to know for sure whether a car will be reliable or leave you stranded every other week – but a well-maintained car is much less likely to do the latter. At the bottom end of the market, it’s pretty rare to find a car with a full stack of carefully kept invoices and a service book that verifies regular, on-time or on-mileage servicing, but it’s not unheard of. Either way, you should aim to see as much evidence of careful maintenance as you can – the more, the better. Cheap cars are often neglected, so if you find one that hasn’t been, grab it.

  Free tacos! Dodgers' Mookie Betts (again) wins everyone Taco Bell with World Series stolen base 
description: > 
  For the second time in three years, Mookie Betts has won free tacos for America.Taco Bell's annual "Steal a Base, Steal a Taco" promotion has been a great success through the years, setting Twitter ablaze anticipating the first stolen base of the World Series – which earns everyone a free Doritos Locos taco.An inning earlier, fans – and the announcers – thought the tacos were in the bag when the Dodgers' Chris Taylor slid safely ahead of a tag into second base.However, it was deemed a wild pitch rather than a stolen base.The free tacos will be available in restaurants on Oct. 28.

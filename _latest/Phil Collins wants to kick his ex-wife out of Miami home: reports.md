It’s not another day in paradise.

Phil Collins is kicking his ex-wife out of his Miami mansion, according to sources close to the singer-songwriter.

Collins, 69, plans to file an eviction lawsuit to remove Orianne Cevey, who says she isn’t going anywhere and recently changed the security codes at the home, according to TMZ.

Cevey, 46, threatened to release potentially embarrassing accusations against Collins if he continues with plans to remove her from the sprawling mansion. Cevey and Collins divorced in 2008, after he reportedly paid her a $46 million settlement, the celebrity website reported.

The couple, who have two sons, reconciled in 2016 after Cevey divorced husband Charles Mejjati. She married another man — Thomas Bates — in Las Vegas two months ago, telling Collins that she was on a business trip at the time, TMZ said.

Sources told TMZ that Cevey wants to renegotiate her 2008 divorce settlement from Collins after she squandered the fortune in bad investments and a divorce from Mejjati.

Cevey’s attorney refused to comment to TMZ.

Vice-chancellors are preparing for an end-of-term testing blitz to get students home for Christmas, as they say a fortnight lockdown is “nonsensical”.

University leaders are opposed to the Government's proposals to place students in effective lockdown for two weeks before Christmas, with students told to remain on campus and all teaching carried out online.

The move is designed to deliver on Boris Johnson’s pledge to “get students home safely for Christmas” but stop the virus from spreading around the country with the mass movement of students at the end of term.

But some vice-chancellors favour the implementation of a testing regime to give students who test negative the green light to travel home at the end of term.

"The plan to keep students in their rooms for two weeks is nonsensical," one university leader told The Telegraph. "What if they go to a shop to buy a cheese sandwich? How will the shop know they are a student?

"Who will stop their mums and dad picking them up? You can't discriminate against them. The solution is around testing."

He said only students who test positive should remain on campus to isolate, and the rest should be free to go home as long as they do not have symptoms.

Prof George Holmes, vice-chancellor of Bolton University of Bolton, said that keeping students locked up for two weeks is "inappropriate".

But he added that carrying out blanket testing of students at the end of term would be a "complete waste of testing capacity".

He said that testing should take place, but that it should be reserved for students travelling from universities in higher risk areas to their homes in lower risk areas.

Proposals to put students on a two week end-of-term lockdown were called “unworkable” by the University and College Union, while the National Union of Students president, Larissa Kennedy, doubted that the government’s legal powers allowed it to confine students to campus.

“We are questioning whether there’s legal precedents to do this and treat students differently than the rest of the population,” she told LBC.

“Students just aren’t the homogenous group that the government seems to think they are. There are students of all ages, students with parents and carers, and what would this mean for students with jobs that they can’t do remotely? It just doesn’t feel like this has been thought through.”

A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “If students are travelling home, we must ensure they do so in a way which minimises the risks of spreading the virus, and the date when universities must stop in-person teaching will be an important part of this. We will set out details on this shortly.”

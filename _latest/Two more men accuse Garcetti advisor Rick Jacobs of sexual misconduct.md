<div><p>Facing two new accusations of sexual misconduct, Rick Jacobs, a top political advisor to Mayor Eric Garcetti, said Tuesday night he will &#8220;take a leave&#8221; from his work amid increasing questions about the allegations. </p><p>Jacobs had previously served as Garcetti&#8217;s deputy chief of staff. He is currently on the board of the nonprofit Mayor&#8217;s Fund for Los Angeles and serves as its treasurer, and is chief executive  of a nonprofit he founded with Garcetti focused on spurring economic development.</p><p>Jacobs said in an emailed statement that he had dedicated himself to advocacy and public service for 17 years. He didn&#8217;t address the allegations against him, saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want this to be a distraction. Therefore, I will take a leave from my non-profit work and my volunteer political work with the mayor.&#8221;</p><p>Jacobs in the past has denied any wrongdoing, and Garcetti has publicly stood by his longtime advisor. On Tuesday, the mayor released a statement saying he takes &#8220;seriously all allegations of harassment.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

    </p>
<p>The accusations could become a political issue for the mayor, who is national co-chair of Joe Biden&#8217;s campaign and has been mentioned as a possible Cabinet appointee if Biden wins the presidency.</p><p>The first sexual harassment allegation against Jacobs came this summer in a lawsuit filed by a <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-14/lapd-officer-accuses-top-garcetti-advisor-of-sexual-harassment" target="_blank">Los Angeles police officer</a> who worked as a bodyguard for Garcetti. The officer alleged that Garcetti witnessed inappropriate behavior by Jacobs toward him, but did not stop it. Garcetti has denied seeing any inappropriate behavior. </p><p>On Monday, in a first-person article posted online, <a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-19/journalist-yashar-ali-alleges-sexual-misconduct-by-garcetti-aide" target="_blank">journalist Yashar Ali</a> accused Jacobs of sexual misconduct. </p><p>Since the lawsuit was filed, The Times has interviewed people who know Jacobs. Some said they were surprised by the lawsuit and said they never witnessed misconduct by Jacobs.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p></p><p id="nativo_1"></p><p>But two individuals have told The Times they have been the targets of unwanted touching or harassing by Jacobs. </p><p>Neither man would agree to allow his name to be published, citing fears of retaliation. Others who were interviewed said they feared that talking about Jacobs would hurt Garcetti&#8217;s political career.</p><p>Neither Garcetti&#8217;s office nor Jacobs responded to written questions sent by The Times about the two men&#8217;s allegations.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>One man said Jacobs groped him when he was leaving a party at Jacobs&#8217; house in 2012.</p><p>The man, who was 30 years old at the time, said he hadn&#8217;t met Jacobs before that day, and went to the party with his boyfriend. As he was leaving, he stopped to say goodbye to Jacobs.</p><p>&#8220;If you and your boyfriend go south, give me a call,&#8221; Jacobs told the man, according to his account.</p><p>He said Jacobs grabbed his buttock with a full palm and squeezed, and then lifted it.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>The man said he had only recently come out as gay, and said he felt stunned and objectified. Jacobs &#8220;was this prominent figure, and it caught me off guard,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;It was so out of the ordinary.&#8221;</p><p>Another guest at the party confirmed the man&#8217;s account. The guest told The Times that the man told him, &#8220;That guy just grabbed my ass.&#8221;</p><p>Another man &#8212; a longtime Democratic strategist &#8212; told The Times he was talking to friends at an event in Los Angeles last year when Jacobs strode over. &#8220;He tried to hug and kiss me forcibly,&#8221; the man recounted in an interview.</p><p>The strategist used both hands to push Jacobs away, but Jacobs persisted, trying to force an embrace, the man said. One of the strategist&#8217;s friends stepped in and asked the man if he needed help.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

    </p>
<p>Another man who was at the event confirmed Jacobs&#8217; behavior towards the man. &#8220;It was grossly uncomfortable,&#8221; the man said.</p><p>The strategist showed The Times communications showing him complaining about Jacobs&#8217; behavior following the event.</p><p>Jacobs is both a political consultant to the mayor and longtime friends with Garcetti and his wife, Amy Wakeland.</p><p>He headed the California operation of Howard Dean&#8217;s 2004 presidential bid, a campaign that Wakeland also worked on.</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

<p>A native of Tennessee, Jacobs worked as an Occidental Petroleum Corp. vice president and founded the liberal advocacy group Courage Campaign.</p><p>He earned a top spot in City Hall &#8212; deputy chief of staff &#8212; after raising money to support Garcetti&#8217;s 2013 mayoral  run before stepping down in 2016.</p><p>Weingart Foundation Chief Executive  Fred Ali, who serves on the board of the Mayor&#8217;s Fund with Jacobs, said he didn&#8217;t witness any behavior that made him uncomfortable or that he deemed inappropriate.</p><p>&#8220;With allegations like these,&#8221; Ali said, &#8220;I think they need to be investigated to the fullest possible extent, and then have the outcomes fall where they fall.&#8221;</p><p class="google-dfp-ad-caption">Advertisement</p>

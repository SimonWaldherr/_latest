<p>This is a "chicken and egg proposition," the analysts said, and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-stimulus-bill-record-high-blackrock-turbulence-preventing-deal-2020-8-1029524617#?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank">they're not the only ones on Wall Street</a> voicing a concern that in order for Washington to pass a fiscal package, the market must "break" first.&#160;</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-expert-sees-us-transitioning-to-insolvency-phase-2020-10?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'I'm extremely concerned': A former Goldman Sachs hedge-fund chief says a flood of troubling signals shows the stock market is teetering &#8212; and warns a small correction could soon morph into something much larger</a></p><p>Stifel remains concerned about the very near-tem fall outlook for the S&amp;P 500, listing "further price correction as a lack of clarity on election night in the Senate (recounts, etc.), a virus seasonal resurgence, weaker 2021 EPS estimates and weak inflation," as factors.</p><p>The analysts also highlighted that the stock market has discounted a possible Democratic sweep leading to "big spending" in 2021 and 2022.

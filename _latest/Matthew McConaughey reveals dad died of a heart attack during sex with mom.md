Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey is gearing up for the release of his new memoir, “Greenlights.”

Within the upcoming tome, the “Dazed and Confused” actor opens up about his family history, revealing in an excerpt featured in his People cover story that his beloved father, James Donald McConaughey, died just how he knew he always would; in bed with wife, Kay.

“I got a call from my Mom. ‘Your dad died.’ My knees buckled. I couldn’t believe it. He was my dad. Nobody or nothing could kill him. Except mom. He’d always told me and my brothers, ‘Boys, when I go, I’m gonna be makin’ love to your mother.’ And that’s what happened. He had a heart attack when he climaxed.”

James died in 1992. He and Kay had an on-again, off-again relationship, marrying each other three separate times. Matthew was conceived shortly after their third wedding.

“They were, at times, violent,” he told People. “As I say in the book, that is how they communicated. They were divorced twice, married three times, I mean, yeah, it was like the Pacific Ocean in a storm.”

Earlier this year, the “White Boy Rick” actor attempted to hook-up his widowed mother, 88, with Hugh Grant’s widowed father, 91-year-old James Grant.

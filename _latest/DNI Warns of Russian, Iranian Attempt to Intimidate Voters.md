<div><p>Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe late Wednesday warned of specific actions by Iran and Russia to undermine Americans' in the upcoming national elections, shortly after reports emerged that voters in Florida and Alaska received intimidating emails threatening them to support President Donald Trump. </p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>Speaking at a press conference late in the day with FBI Director Christopher Wray, Ratcliffe said that operatives in Iran and Russia obtained some voter registration information &#8211; which analysts say is relatively easy to gather &#8211; and used it to convey false information "that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos, and undermine your confidence in American democracy." </p><p>Iranian actors also distributed videos designed to cast doubt on the legitimacy of certain ballots, Ratcliffe said. </p><p>"These actions are desperate attempts by desperate adversaries," Ratcliffe said. "Even if the adversaries pursue further attempts to intimidate or undermine voter confidence, know that our election systems are resilient and you can be confident your votes are secure." </p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Political Cartoons on Iran</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/9567028/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F7b%2F6c%2Fdbf4a49048f6b684bc01e5d104c1%2Fkn011120dapc.jpg" class="Image__PictureImage-sc-412cjc-0 cjIqES Image-sc-412cjc-2 SlideshowEmbed__Picture-fkpjfn-0 eSVwNn"><p class="SlideshowEmbed__ArrowWrapper-fkpjfn-6 jGHfsH"></p><p>"We are standing before you now to give you the confidence that we are on top of this, and providing you with the most powerful weapon we have to combat these efforts: The truth, information," Ratcliffe said. </p><p>The warning and assurance from the director, who as a member of Congress from Texas was among Trump's most fervent political allies, was met almost immediately with skepticism from senior lawmakers. They believe his assertions amount at least in part to a ploy to distance the president from broad intelligence assessments that Moscow seeks to ensure his reelection and to instead parlay some of that blame onto other adversaries with which the administration has focused particular ire. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>"All year, the Trump administration has been desperately trying to bury information about Russian interference and overhype efforts by Iran and China. The truth is simple &#8211; only Russia has both the capability and intent to significantly disrupt our election," Sen. Chris Murphy said in a statement. The Connecticut Democrat heads the European Affairs subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "If Director Ratcliffe is serious when he says we will not allow foreign interference in our elections, then this administration would actually do something to deter the Kremlin rather than withhold information about Russian interference and create false equivalences with other nation's efforts."</p><p>In a statement, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats from California, lamented what they consider the Senate's refusal to take up multiple bills the House has passed to combat foreign election interference. </p><p>Intelligence officials were scheduled to brief congressional committees on the new information sometime Thursday. </p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Among the emails some voters received on Wednesday were threatening messages purportedly from the Proud Boys, a "Western chauvinist" organization that supports Trump, such as "Vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you." Lauren Poe, the mayor of Gainesville, Florida, where some voters received the messages, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/florida-alaska-trump-emails.html">The New York Times</a> they amounted to "a very brutish way of trying to intimidate people from going to the polls." She added that few of the constituents she had spoken with appeared to have been fooled by the messages. </p><p>The Proud Boys wrought national attention last month when Trump appeared to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-09-29/trump-declines-to-condemn-white-supremacists-in-first-presidential-debate">refuse to distance himself</a> from them during the first presidential debate. He later issued a statement condemning the group. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Metadata from the emails indicate they originated from a server in Estonia, according to the Times.</p><p>Many analysts believe Russia is not intent on supporting Trump specifically but sees his election as a way to achieve a broader goal of sowing doubt in America's system of government and Western-style liberalism as a whole. And some doubt the extent to which any other country poses an equal threat. </p><p>"Russia is perhaps the most sophisticated adversary that uses these disinformation techniques," says Matthew Schmidt, professor at the University of New Haven who has frequently advised Congress on security policy related to Russia. "Voter information is easy to obtain, and the goal is to use a mass of that information to target thousands of voters with emails or texts designed to stoke fear in people about how safe it is to vote. This is an operation designed to hack people's sense of safety and privacy around the election process."</p><p>Cyber analyst John Hultquist said the tenor of the emails and videos purportedly distributed by Iran was not to keep significant numbers of Americans away from polling stations but to highlight existing fears of voter intimidation. </p><p>"The goal of operations that prey on both sides is to broaden existing divides. By serving up something for everyone the sponsors of this operation undermine the whole democratic process. That's probably their primary aim," Hultquist, an analyst with FireEye, wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnHultquist/status/1319148553617526785">on Twitter</a>. <br></p></div>

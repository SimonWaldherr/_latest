Johnson noted that staff immediately asked the FBI to confirm certain details in order to validate the claim, but the bureau said they would not confirm or deny any of the information included in their request.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-hunter-biden-story-joe-biden-damage-credibility"><strong>NOEM ARGUES HUNTER BIDEN STORY 'DOES GRAVE DAMAGE' TO FORMER VICE PRESIDENT'S CREDIBILITY</strong></a></p><p>"The FBI has a duty to inform us.

"The committee must know if it receives information that could be fraudulent or not accurate."</p><p>Johnson mentioned the possibility that the information could be the result of foreign election interference, in which case a defensive briefing would be appropriate. He also acknowledged that if the whistleblower knowingly provided false information, that could be a crime.</p><p>"For these reasons, the committee must know whether the FBI has assessed the validity of materials the whistleblower has provided, and what, if any, actions the FBI has taken since obtaining this information," Johnson continued.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-china-email-source-verifies"><strong>SOURCE ON ALLEGED HUNTER BIDEN EMAIL CHAIN VERIFIES MESSAGE ABOUT CHINESE INVESTMENT FIRM</strong></a></p><p>The letter included a series of questions Johnson would like the FBI to answer regarding the laptop, including whether the FBI does indeed "possess material from Hunter Biden's laptop," and, if so, when and how they acquired it, whether the FBI has determined whether the records on the computer are genuine or were altered at all, whether they determined whether the records were authored by Hunter Biden, or if there is evidence that the computer had been hacked.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Johnson asked the FBI to respond with answers to his questions no later than October 22.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p>Fox News reached out to the FBI for comment but the bureau did not immediately respond.</p><p class="ad gam"></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p><p>Johnson's letter appears to indicate&#160;that the laptop in question is the same one referenced in a recent <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/">New York Post</a> report about emails said to be Hunter Biden's.

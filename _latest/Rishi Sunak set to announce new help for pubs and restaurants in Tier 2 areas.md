  Rishi Sunak set to announce new help for pubs and restaurants in Tier 2 areas 
description: > 
  Rishi Sunak is poised to announce extra help for pubs and restaurants struggling to survive in areas under Tier 2 coronavirus restrictions.The Chancellor is understood to be working on a compensation package for thousands of businesses whose trade is restricted by Government regulations after they complained of being left in limbo without support.While firms such as pubs in Tier 3 that are forced to close by law can access business grants and the two-thirds wage subsidy, those in the next tier down cannot because the law does not force them to close.It means hospitality venues across large areas of the country in which the 10pm curfew remains in force and indoor mixing between households is banned can only access the less generous part-time subsidy, which still requires them to contribute 55 per cent of wages.The mismatch has led to warnings from senior business leaders and MPs that thousands of companies are "stuck between a rock and a hard place", with hundreds of thousands of jobs in hospitality now at risk in the run-up to Christmas.

<p>"It's tough to realize that the days where I do not think I'm under a death sentence are over," Limbaugh said during the show. "Now, we all are, is the point. We all know that we're going to die at some point, but when you have a terminal disease diagnosis that has a time frame to it, then that puts a different psychological and even physical awareness to it."</p><p>Limbaugh, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-to-award-presidential-medal-of-freedom-to-rush-limbaugh-2020-2">who in February was awarded the presidential medal of freedom from President Donald Trump</a>, has hosted the nationally syndicated "The Rush Limbaugh Show" for more than 30 years.

<p>"But there's always the reality and the knowledge that that can change and it can come back because it is cancer.

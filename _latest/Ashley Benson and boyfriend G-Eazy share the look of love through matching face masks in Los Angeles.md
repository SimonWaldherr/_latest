She's making the most of her time at home amid the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.

And Ashley Benson stepped out for a quick coffee run with boyfriend G-Eazy in Los Angeles on Friday afternoon.

The 30-year-old actress rocked an all-black ensemble with a matching face mask for a quick pick-me-up from her neighborhood cafe.

The Pretty Little Liars star kept things extra casual in an over-sized Celine sweatshirt and black leggings.

Her new pink highlights were hidden as she slicked back her usually blonde hair while walking with her beau and a pal.

G-Eazy — who's real name is Gerald Earl Gillum — sported a lime green shirt with an Oakland Athletic's hat.

Whoops: While the couple were attempting to practice safe mask wearing in their coordinated coverings, G-Eazy kept his mask below his lip, effectively eliminating any safety measure

While the couple were attempting to practice safe mask wearing in their coordinated coverings, G-Eazy kept his mask below his lip, effectively eliminating any safety measure.

Last month it was reported that Ashley's ex-girlfriend, Cara Delevingne, has started seeing G's former flame Halsey, 25.

According to The Sun, the 28-year-old model has been enjoying a new romance with singer and budding actress Halsey, 25, after separating from Ashley in April.

While Cara and Ashley were together for nearly two years before splitting this spring, G-Eazy and Halsey split back in 2018, after shacking up in August of the year prior.

The pair reportedly connected romantically while working on their duet Him And I, but separated following speculation that he had cheated on her, and the former couple have continued to throw jabs at each other through their music.

Following his split from Halsey, the I Mean It rapper was previously linked to Yasmin Wijnaldum and Megan Thee Stallion before he was spotted out with Ashley, just weeks after her breakup from Cara.

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The following lines come from speeches Trump has delivered in just the past few days:</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;If he wins, the radical left will be running the country and they&#8217;re addicted to power and God help us if they ever got it, because we would never have the same country again.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;If he wins, there will be nothing but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bedlam all over the place</a>.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;If Biden wins, China wins, all these other countries win.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. He won&#8217;t be running the country. The radical left will take over.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;If Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your health care is gone, the middle class is gone, and your safety is gone.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;If Sleepy Joe Biden and the Democrat Socialists are elected, every citizen in America will be subjected to their extreme ideology, possessed by this Marxist madness.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">It is a sign to me that he fully expects his re-election bid to fail. It means that Democrats&#8217; optimism about the election outcome is well placed. This man is panicking. He made it clear when he said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a campaign rally in Michigan</a> on Saturday:</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">&#8220;And you know then they say, they&#8217;re taking away &#8230; Me, I&#8217;m taking away their freedom. Then they say, &#8216;If you lose, will you have a friendly transition?&#8217; I say, &#8216;I want a fair election.&#8217; Then they say, &#8216;Will you have a fair &#8230; We want a fair and friendly transition.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Really? Well, when I won, you spied on my campaign, we caught you trying to overthrow the president of the United States. You&#8217;re crooked as hell. And we caught you and let&#8217;s see what happens to them. But you&#8217;re crooked as hell.&#8217; And to me, that didn&#8217;t exactly look like a friendly transition.&#8221;</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The postelection drama threatens to be a disaster that could truly test America&#8217;s institutions and indeed our democracy itself. But, we&#8217;ll just have to deal with that when we get to it.</p></div>

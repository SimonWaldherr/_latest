Brokering NBA blockbusters is hard for myriad reasons, not the least of which is a weighty reluctance—if not an outright refusal—to let go of a star.

While you've probably heard that no one in the Association is truly untouchable, you also recognize there are players who functionally qualify as such. The top rung on the superstar ladder is occupied by players who would never be traded unless they forced it to happen.

Well, that or they could find themselves included a hypothetical-trade hysteria like this.

No one is untouchable here, and in fact, each team's player who best fits the label will be the one shipped out. This probably isn't a precursor to many (or any) actual real-world swaps, but it is a fun mental exercise to try to determine the trade value of players who aren't actually available in trades.

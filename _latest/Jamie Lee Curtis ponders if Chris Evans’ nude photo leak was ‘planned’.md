Jamie Lee Curtis has a new theory about Chris Evans’ d—k pic scandal.

The “Knives Out” star said on “The Kelly Clarkson Show” Monday that because Evans, 39, turned the nude photo leak into an opportunity to get people to vote, she wondered whether it was a “planned” stunt.

“He’s so smart and such an unbelievably beautiful human being, I’m wondering if it was even planned,” Curtis, 61, said.

“Oh, he’s so clever,” Clarkson, 38, responded. “I kind of think it was planned just because he was trying to get people to vote.”

Curtis said she missed an opportunity to joke that Evans “took after his movie father, Don Johnson.”

“Cause I’m really, really close friends with Melanie Griffith,” the “Halloween” star added. “She’s one of my best friends and has been forever, and she was married to him twice.”

In September, Evans shared a video on Twitter without trimming the clip, which then revealed a gallery of videos and pictures, including one featuring a photo of an erect penis.

After causing a major stir on social media, he quipped on Twitter, “Now that I have your attention 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️…. VOTE Nov 3rd!!!”

Curtis replied on Twitter at the time, “My boy! Proud of him. Got MY attention!”

Despite Curtis and Clarkson’s speculation, Evans has said the leaked penis pic was “embarrassing.”

“It was an interesting weekend full of lessons learned, a lot of teachable moments,” Evans said on “The Tamron Hall Show” in September. “It’s embarrassing, but you gotta roll with the punches.”

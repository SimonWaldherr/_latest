Welsh police could use ANPR to identify people travelling across the border from England, the First Minister has threatened.

Mark Drakeford said police in Wales could use automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) technology to identify visitors from areas of the UK with high levels of coronavirus, as he said they had “a range of techniques” at their disposal.

He said: "Number plates are one of the ways in which they are able to identify cars that are travelling long distances, but that won't be the only way.

"They will have long-practised techniques developed earlier in the year and they will apply those again over the weeks to come."

Mr Drakeford previously suggested to The Telegraph that he would return to Wales' previous "Stay Local" law, which prevented people travelling more than five miles from their homes.

He added that police officers will also carry out extra patrols on main roads.

<div><p>Trump says &#8216;nobody gets hacked&#8217; but forgot his hotel chain was hacked &#8212; twice</p><p id="speakable-summary">According to President Trump speaking at a campaign event in Tucson, Arizona, on Monday, &#8220;nobody gets hacked.&#8221; You don&#8217;t need someone who covers security day in and day out to call bullshit on this one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody gets hacked. To get hacked you need somebody with 197 IQ and he needs about 15 percent of your password,&#8221; Trump said, referencing the recent suspension of C-SPAN political editor Steve Scully, who admitted falsely claiming his Twitter account was hacked this week after sending a tweet to former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.</p>

<p></p><p>There&#8217;s a lot to unpack in those two-dozen words. But aside from the fact that not all hackers are male (and it&#8217;s sexist to assume that), and glossing over the two entirely contrasting sentences, Trump also neglected to mention that his hotel chain was hacked twice &#8212; once over a year-long period <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-57993">between 2014 and 2015</a> and again <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-100019">between 2016 and 2017</a>.</p>
<p>We know this because the Trump business was legally required to file notice with state regulators after each breach, which they did.</p>
<p>In both incidents, customers of Trump&#8217;s hotels had their credit card data stolen. The second breach was blamed on a <a href="https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-update-on-cybersecurity-incident/">third-party booking system, called Sabre</a>, which also exposed guest names, emails, phone numbers and more.</p>
<p>The disclosures didn&#8217;t say how many people were affected. Suffice it to say, it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not return a request for comment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to ignore what could be considered a throwaway line: To say that &#8220;nobody gets hacked&#8221; might seem harmless on the face of it, but to claim so is dangerous. It&#8217;s as bad as saying something is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/08/why-an-unhackable-mobile-phone-is-a-complete-marketing-myth/">&#8220;unhackable&#8221;</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/eyedisk-encrypted-flash-drive-unhackable/">&#8220;hack-proof.&#8221;</a> Ask anyone who works in cybersecurity and they&#8217;ll tell you that no person or company can ever make such assurances.</p>
<p>Absolute security doesn&#8217;t exist. But for those who don&#8217;t know any different, it&#8217;s an excuse not to think about their own security. Yes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-password-manager/">you should use a password manager</a>. Absolutely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-two-factor/">turn on two-factor authentication</a> whenever you can. Do the basics, because hackers don&#8217;t need an IQ score of 197 to break into your accounts. All they need is for you to lower your guard.</p>
<p>If &#8220;nobody gets hacked&#8221; as Trump claims, it makes you wonder whatever happened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/well/live/a-400-pound-hacker-trump-comment-ignites-fat-shaming-debate.html">the 400-pound hacker</a> the president mentioned during his first White House run.</p>

<div><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">This country is having to conduct an election in the midst of a pandemic that has claimed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" title="">over 220,000 American lives</a>. Fortunately for both our health and our democracy, voters have options to cast their ballot without putting their health at risk.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">One of us is a member of Congress, and the other is an infectious diseases physician with expertise in biosecurity and pandemic response. We have both fielded plenty of questions &#8212; from people in our state, South Carolina, and around the country &#8212; about how to safely participate in the election. Our advice is simple:</p><h2 class="css-ow6j0y eoo0vm40" id="link-4b94f1dc">1) Make a plan.</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Before heading to the polls, voters should make a plan to cast their ballot safely. Depending on your state, options include early in-person voting, voting by ballot drop box and voting by mail in addition to voting on Election Day. If you want to vote in person, fill out <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.usa.gov/voter-research" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a sample ballot</a> beforehand to reduce your time inside the polling place.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">All of the information you need to make a plan can be found at <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vote.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vote.org</a>. First, check your <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registration status</a>. If you aren&#8217;t yet registered, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in some states it is still possible to do so</a> for this election. Once you are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vote.org/register-to-vote/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registered</a>, check out your voting options by clicking on your state at the bottom of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vote.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vote.org</a> home page.</p><h2 class="css-ow6j0y eoo0vm40" id="link-36767b99">2) Vote early if you can.</h2><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends early voting because it reduces crowds at polling places. Decreasing the number of people standing in line and the density of crowds on Election Day reduces the risk of coronavirus transmission, thus keeping voters and poll workers safer. Many states have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded early voting hours on weekdays and weekends</a>, so consider voting at an off-peak time.</p></div>

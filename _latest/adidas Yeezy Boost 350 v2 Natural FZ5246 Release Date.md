This month&#8217;s upcoming &#8220;Natural&#8221; &#8212; which was recently changed from &#8220;Abez&#8221; to avoid biblical references &#8212; is effectively much of the same at first glance, but like that of the silhouette&#8217;s more recent iterations, the pair brings some subtle additions to its construction.</p>
<p>Most notable of which can be found along the tongue: while the laces would typically loop through the weave and end in a knot, they now lock down across the peak, creating a much cleaner look compared to past methods. Elsewhere, the construction is much of the same by comparison, though the offering does remove the heel pulls that would often visually obstruct the silhouette along the counter. The upper throughout then takes the helm in two variations of the titular color, separating the top and bottom half with dark and light shades, respectively.</p>
<p>Grab an official look at these here ahead of the October 24th release and expect to hear more about raffles, drops, and the like very soon.</p>

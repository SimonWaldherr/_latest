<div><p>Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/19/donald-trump-lashes-stupid-republican-critics-nevada-rally/">lashed out at Republican senators</a> distancing themselves from him as the party&#8217;s tensions were laid bare in public with election day now just two weeks away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/donald-trump/">The US president</a> appeared to dub Republican critics &#8220;stupid&#8221; at a rally on Sunday after a slew of the party&#8217;s congressmen publicly expressed displeasure with aspects of Mr Trump's leadership.&#160;</p>
<p>Among them are senators locked in tight re-election battles. The criticisms have been taken as a sign that they believe it is in their political benefit to hold the president at arm&#8217;s length.</p>
<p>Mr Trump singled out one Republican senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska whose excoriating views on the president leaked last week, during a Nevada rally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have some stupid people,&#8221; Mr Trump said, first referencing critical former Republican senators Jeff Flake and &#160;Bob Corker, who stood down in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;But now we have this guy Sasse. He wants to make a statement. Little Ben. Little Ben Sasse.&#8221;</p>

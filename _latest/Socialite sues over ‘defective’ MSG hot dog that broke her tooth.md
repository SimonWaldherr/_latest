  Socialite sues over ‘defective’ MSG hot dog that broke her tooth 
description: > 
  A Manhattan socialite — who was once engaged to Gloria Vanderbilt’s estranged son — says she broke her tooth chowing down on a “defective” hot dog while at a luxury suite in Madison Square Garden, new court papers show.“The aforesaid Sabrett frankfurter was defective in that it was not reasonably safe for its intended or reasonably foreseeable purpose,” the court documents charge.The Tudor City woman is seeking unspecified damages from both MSG and Sabrett parent company Marathon Enterprises, Inc., claiming they were negligent in safely distributing and preparing the hot dog.It was not immediately clear whether the frankfurter Sandmeyer ate was one of the recalled products, made between March 17 and July 4, 2017.A rep for MSG said: “We are reviewing the complaint and have no comment.”Marathon did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

<div><p>Franks for nothing!</p>
<p>A Manhattan socialite &#8212; who <a href="https://pagesix.com/2016/04/16/ex-fiancee-of-gloria-vanderbilts-estranged-son-cant-watch-painful-family-documentary/?_ga=1.12648567.1101988533.1451393084">was once engaged</a> to Gloria Vanderbilt&#8217;s estranged son &#8212; says she broke her tooth chowing down on a &#8220;defective&#8221; hot dog while at a luxury suite in Madison Square Garden, new court papers show.</p>
<p>April Sandmeyer says she was at the Midtown arena on July 25, 2017 when she &#8220;bit into and chewed &#8230; [a] Sabrett frankfurter,&#8221; and suffered &#8220;dental injuries due to there being hard, extraneous materials, potentially bone fragments&#8221; in the weenie, her Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aforesaid Sabrett frankfurter was defective in that it was not reasonably safe for its intended or reasonably foreseeable purpose,&#8221; the court documents charge.</p>
<p>The Tudor City woman is seeking unspecified damages from both MSG and Sabrett parent company Marathon Enterprises, Inc., claiming they were negligent in safely distributing and preparing the hot dog.</p>
<p>Because of this Sandmeyer, sustained &#8220;severe personal injuries including &#8230; tooth fractures and has suffered severe pain, suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life and economic damages,&#8221; the court papers allege.</p>
<p>On July 17, 2017, Sabrett issued a massive recall for 7 million pounds of beef and pork hot dog and sausages that may have contained bone fragments, WebMD <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20170717/sabrett-hot-dogs-recalled" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported at the time</a>.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the frankfurter Sandmeyer ate was one of the recalled products, made between March 17 and July 4, 2017.</p>
<p>The suit does not say what Sandmeyer was doing at MSG that day. Jam band Phish played there that night, <a href="https://phish.net/setlists/phish-july-25-2017-madison-square-garden-new-york-ny-usa.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to online records</a>.</p>
<p>Sandmeyer is the ex-fianc&#233;e of Vanderbilt&#8217;s son Chris Stokowski &#8212; who disappeared from the family for nearly 40 years before <a href="https://pagesix.com/2016/11/16/anderson-cooper-reconciles-with-long-lost-brother/?_ga=2.248590351.969613941.1603114321-1264002134.1559153175" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reuniting with his half brother Anderson Cooper</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Sandmeyer has appeared as an extra in movies including 1994&#8217;s &#8220;Miracle on 34th Street,&#8221; <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5669785/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to IMDB.com</a>.</p>
<p>A rep for MSG said: &#8220;We are reviewing the complaint and have no comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marathon did not immediately return a message seeking comment.</p>

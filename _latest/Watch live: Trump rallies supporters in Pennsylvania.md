President Trump is rallying supporters Tuesday night in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, for his second rally since he returned to the campaign trail after battling COVID-19. On Monday, Mr. Trump traveled to Sanford, Florida, for first campaign rally since announcing he had tested positive for the virus.

"I went through it. Now they say I'm immune," the president said during his Monday rally. His doctor has said he is no longer infectious, and scientists have cautioned that there is little known about COVID-19 immunity since so much is still unknown about the virus. "I feel so powerful I'll walk into that audience. I'll walk in there, I'll kiss everyone in that audience. I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful woman and the — I'll just give you a big fat kiss."

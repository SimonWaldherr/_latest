<p>Sweden's top pandemic expert has claimed there is &#8220;very weak&#8221; evidence that mask wearing in society is effective.</p>
<p>Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, said it was &#8220;dangerous&#8221; to believe masks could make &#8220;huge difference&#8221; in the fight against Covid-19.&#160;</p>
<p>Speaking to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Mr Tegnell said: "Unfortunately, the evidence between using masks in society is very weak... we don't really have a good idea of where they should be used, (and) to what extent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that despite a lot of European countries making masks mandatory they are now experiencing a surge in cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it's dangerous to believe that masks will make a huge difference when you have an epidemic like this one,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sweden is also considering reducing restrictions for its elderly and shielding population, he added, and the country's increase in cases has been "slowing down".</p>
<p>However, a recent study&#160;from Simon Fraser University found the use of masks can almost half the number of new Covid-19 cases.</p>
<p>Covering the face indoors resulted in up to<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/10/face-masks-can-almost-halve-number-new-coronavirus-cases-study/"> 46 per cent fewer new Covid-19 cases every week </a>in Canada, the researchers found.</p>

By using contracts to maintain its monopoly, the suit says, competition and innovation has suffered.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Attorney General William P. Barr, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, has played an unusually active role in the investigation. He pushed career Justice Department attorneys to bring the case by the end of September, prompting pushback from lawyers who wanted more time and complained of political influence. Mr. Barr has spoken publicly about the inquiry for months and set tight deadlines for the prosecutors leading the effort.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The lawsuit may stretch on for years and could <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html" title="">set off a cascade of other antitrust lawsuits</a> from state attorneys general. About four dozen states and jurisdictions have conducted parallel investigations and are expected to bring separate complaints against the company&#8217;s grip on technology for online advertising.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">A victory for the government could remake one of America&#8217;s most recognizable companies and the internet economy that it has helped define since it was founded by two Stanford University graduate students in 1998.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">But Google has long denied accusations of antitrust violations and is expected to fight the government&#8217;s efforts by using a global network of lawyers, economists and lobbyists. Alphabet, valued at $1.04 trillion and with cash reserves of $120 billion, has fought similar antitrust lawsuits in Europe.</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-mccabe" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">David McCabe</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cecilia-kang" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="heres-what-the-justice-department-had-to-say-about-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#heres-what-the-justice-department-had-to-say-about-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google">Here&#8217;s what the Justice Department had to say about its antitrust lawsuit against Google.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Deputy U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey A.

The scrutiny reflects how Google has become a dominant player in communications, commerce and media over the last two decades. It controls 90 percent of the market for online searches, according to one estimate. That business is lucrative: Last year, Google brought in $34.3 billion in search revenue in the United States, according to the research firm eMarketer. That figure is expected to grow to $42.5 billion by 2022, the firm said.<br><br>In the 449-page report, lawmakers said the four companies had turned from &#8220;scrappy&#8221; start-ups into &#8220;the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">To mend the inequities, the lawmakers recommended restoring competition by effectively breaking up the companies, emboldening the agencies that police market concentration and throwing up hurdles for the companies to acquire start-ups. They also proposed reforming antitrust laws, in the biggest potential shift since the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 created stronger reviews of big mergers.<br></p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cecilia-kang" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Cecilia Kang</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-mccabe" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="deadline-day-for-stimulus-talks-where-things-stand"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#deadline-day-for-stimulus-talks-where-things-stand">Deadline day for stimulus talks: Where things stand.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Capitol on Sunday." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/18/us/politics/18election-briefing-pelosi-sub/merlin_178697223_9bc20ff4-bcf4-4649-9190-1dbd31212a70-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Capitol on Sunday.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times</p></p></p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California set a Tuesday deadline for a compromise stimulus deal that could be considered before the election.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">She instructed key Democratic lawmakers on Monday to work with top Republicans to try to resolve critical differences holding up a broad agreement with the Trump administration.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The directive came after she and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, held their latest talks, speaking for nearly an hour by phone. The two &#8220;continued to narrow their differences,&#8221; said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi. He added that &#8220;the speaker continues to hope that, by the end of the day Tuesday, we will have clarity on whether we will be able to pass a bill before the election.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The odds of a last-minute deal remain long, with Democrats and the Trump administration still haggling over funding levels and policy issues. Even if they could agree, Senate Republicans have all but ruled out embracing a plan anywhere near as large as the more than $2 trillion package under discussion.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">If such a deal were struck, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the chamber would consider it, but he also made a point of scheduling two separate votes in the coming days on narrower bills of the kind senators in his party are more willing to accept. One would revive a lapsed federal loan program for small businesses and the other would provide $500 billion for schools, testing and expired unemployment benefits.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">President Trump has insisted in recent days that he wants to spend more than the $2.4 trillion Ms. Pelosi has put forward in negotiations, and claimed he could easily cajole enough Senate Republicans into supporting an agreement of that size &#8212; a notion that many of them have told his top deputies would never happen.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">In a private call with Democrats on Monday, Ms. Pelosi outlined a number of remaining areas of disagreement, including Democratic demands for hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for state and local governments, support for restaurants devastated by the pandemic and additional health provisions, according to a person on the call, who disclosed the details on condition of anonymity. Democrats also remain wary that the administration would spend the funds as Congress intended.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Still, Ms. Pelosi insisted she was optimistic a bargain could be reached and said she was intent on reaching one before a new Democratic administration began in January.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to carry over the droppings of this grotesque elephant into the next presidency,&#8221; Ms. Pelosi told her members. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get something big, and we&#8217;ve got to get it done soon and we&#8217;ve got to get it done right.&#8221;</p><p class="css-1fxka73 e1jsehar1">&#8212;  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0">Emily Cochrane</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater" class="css-brehiz e1jsehar0"></a></p><h3 class="css-131kqdc">Advertisement</h3><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">Continue reading the main story</a><p class="ad dfp-ad-mid2-wrapper" id="dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p id="after-dfp-ad-mid2"></p><p class="css-608m5d" id="us-stocks-climb-as-a-deadline-for-a-stimulus-deal-arrives"></p><h2 class="css-139up7i eoo0vm40"><a class="css-16ra6z9" href="#us-stocks-climb-as-a-deadline-for-a-stimulus-deal-arrives">U.S. stocks climb as a deadline for a stimulus deal arrives.</a></h2><p class="css-z3e15g"></p><img alt="People walk by the New York Stock Exchange in lower Manhattan." class="css-11cwn6f" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/business/20markets/merlin_177952182_1f4210e8-7db6-4de5-ace3-77901e73ba32-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"><p class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">People walk by the New York Stock Exchange in lower Manhattan.</p><p class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90"><p class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</p><p><p>Spencer Platt/Getty Images</p></p></p><ul class="css-5d1ibl ez3869y0"><li class="css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0"><p class="css-nxfrgc evys1bk0">U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, the day Speaker Nancy Pelosi has set as a deadline for reaching an agreement with Republicans on an economic stimulus package.

Fliers leaving Heathrow Airport in London can get a rapid test for 80 pounds ($104). Starting Tuesday, people going to Hong Kong can take a pre-departure test to meet entry requirements there, the airport said.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">The service will initially be offered for four weeks and passengers must book it ahead of time. The tests will be done by private-sector nurses, with results expected within an hour.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Heathrow, Britain&#8217;s largest airport, has been urging the government to allow it to offer more testing, particularly to arrivals, in an effort to boost travel. Heathrow argues that on-site testing would limit the need for two-week quarantines for people arriving in Britain. Government ministers have disagreed.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">As an international hub, Heathrow Airport typically sees more than 80 million passengers a year. But during the pandemic, governments have introduced a range of travel restrictions, and passengers have been wary of venturing too far from home, causing overseas travel to plummet. The airport said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.heathrow.com/latest-news/testing-deadline-to-safeguard-jobs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1.2 million passengers</a> traveled through it in September, down 82 percent compared with 2019.</p><p class="css-1c6ppvu evys1bk0">Heathrow hopes its new program could be the start of a more expansive testing regime in the airport. For now, the airport will offer a test known as LAMP, which is not as sensitive as PCR testing, used by the country&#8217;s national health service. PCR tests can detect active infections even before symptoms appear, though with a daylong turnaround.

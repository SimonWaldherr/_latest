  Is Biden bringing Black voters back to the polls? The answer could decide who wins North Carolina 
description: > 
  In the 2016 election, Black voters in North Carolina overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump - by 80 percentage points according to some exit polls.In Asheville, the Black turnout has heartened Michael Hayes, who heads a community health nonprofit in the city.Some recent polls indicate Trump has gained traction among young Black voters, perhaps somewhat denting Democratsâ€™ recent grip on the Black electorate.With President Barack Obama running for a second term, 75% of North Carolina Black voters cast ballots in 2012.Black turnout dropped to 66% when Hilary Clinton ran for president four years later.

 <p>     </p> <p>After briefly exchanging messages, Dolheguy convinced the Indian-born student to come to her house for sex.</p> <p>Before he arrived, sick Dolheguy went online and searched, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill someone tonight for fun&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill someone tonight help&#8221; and &#8220;I want to commit murder&#8221;.</p> <p> She also visited a website called &#8220;ten steps to commit a murder and get away with it&#8221;, reports <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/courts-law/sex-toy-strangler-jamie-lee-dolheguy-could-be-out-in-three-years/news-story/7273f04b48595e96c806534362425b40" rel="nofollow">news.com.au.</a></p> <p>The pair engaged in "choke play" when Mr Rathod arrived and the then 18-year-old Dolheguy wrapped her arm around his neck from behind and applied pressure.</p> <p>Mr Rathod used a "tapping" signal for her to stop, but she kept hold of his neck.</p>

 <p>She then wrapped the cable of a sex toy around his neck and tightened it, before calling the police for help.</p> <p>Justice Almond added: "It is abundantly clear in your case that there was a degree of premeditation with respect to the act of violence. You had no sexual interest in Mr Rathod.</p> <p>"You decided that strangulation would be quick and easy."</p> <p>Mr Rathod died in hospital the day after the horrific act.</p>

   <p>The court heard Dolheguy suffered extreme abuse and neglect at a young age -leaving her with a severe personality disorder.</p> <p>She also felt no empathy or remorse for her victim, the judge said.</p> <p>Dolheguy was removed from her home at age 10 because of the horrific conditions and had two carers around the clock from the age of 14.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>
<p class="my-logo primary-loader-icon"></p>
<p>Aged 18, her 24-hour care was withdrawn and the disturbed teen was left to live alone.</p> <p>Barrister Sharon Lacy previously told the jury during the trial that Dolheguy was &#8220;damaged&#8221; and her mind was &#8220;chaos&#8221; at the time of the killing, and there was no way they could be satisfied of murderous intent.</p></div>

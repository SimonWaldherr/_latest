  McConnell advises White House not to strike pre-election stimulus deal with Pelosi. 
description: > 
  Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has advised the White House not to strike a deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new stimulus bill before Election Day, he told Republican senators privately on Tuesday, cautioning against reaching an agreement that most in the party cannot accept.It underscored the divisions within the party that have long hampered a compromise.Ms. Pelosi had said earlier on Tuesday that she was “optimistic” a deal could be reached with the Trump administration in the coming days.But Republicans are growing increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump and his team are too eager to reach a multitrillion-dollar agreement and are conceding far too much to the Democrats.Mr. McConnell said he told the White House he was particularly concerned a deal before then could inject unwanted unpredictability into the schedule, according to the Republicans, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a closed party luncheon.

But Republicans are growing increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump and his team are too eager to reach a multitrillion-dollar agreement and are conceding far too much to the Democrats. Republicans fear that scenario would force their colleagues up for re-election into a difficult choice of defying the president or alienating their fiscally conservative base by embracing the big-spending bill he has demanded.</p><p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Republicans in the Senate were also concerned that any vote on such a package could interfere with the Senate&#8217;s hasty timetable for confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court by early next week.

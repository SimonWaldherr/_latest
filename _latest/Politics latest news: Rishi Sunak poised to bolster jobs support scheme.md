description: > 
  Rishi Sunak will today announce a change to the job support scheme which will see the Government boost the wage subsidy for part-time workers, The Telegraph understands.Currently the scheme requires businesses in tier one and tier two areas to contribute 55 per cent towards the employees’ wages in order to receive a 22 per cent top up from the Government.However, insiders say Mr Sunak will today announce a reduction in employer contributions and an increase in the subsidy, helping to relieve pressure on firms which have seen their trade fall due to the 10pm pub curfew and ban on household mixing indoors.This would bring the part-time scheme closer to the enhanced scheme available in tier three areas, which pays a 66 per cent wage subsidy for firms required to close.​Read the latest updates below

<p>Rishi Sunak will today announce a change to the job support scheme which will see the Government boost the wage subsidy for part-time workers, The Telegraph understands.</p>
<p>Currently the scheme requires businesses in tier one and tier two areas to contribute 55 per cent towards the employees&#8217; wages in order to receive a 22 per cent top up from the Government.&#160;</p>
<p>However, insiders say Mr Sunak will today announce a reduction in employer contributions and an increase in the subsidy, helping to relieve pressure on firms which have seen their trade fall due to the 10pm pub curfew and ban on household mixing indoors.</p>
<p>This would bring the part-time scheme closer to the enhanced scheme available in tier three areas, which pays a 66 per cent wage subsidy for firms required to close.&#160;</p>
<p>Employers are only required to pay national insurance and pension contributions in these areas.The Chancellor is also understood to have discussed increasing the eligibility of cash grants of up to &#163;3,000 a month, which are currently limited to firms which have been forced to close by law.</p>

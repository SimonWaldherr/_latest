New York City is entering a “crucial” week in its fight against the coronavirus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday, amid a resurgence of the bug in swaths of Brooklyn and Queens.

The mayor said he hoped the new state-ordered restrictions, enforcement of the rules and neighborhood compliance would help to squash the spike in COVID-19 cases and get the city back to where it was last month.

“With luck, this week will be decisive in all of our favor,” de Blasio said on NY1’s “Inside City Hall.”

“By the end of the following week, we might be able to get things back to where we were in September,” he added.

Anti-lockdown protests raged last week in some of the designated COVID-19 “red” zones, following Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision to close non-essential businesses and restrict the sizes of religious gatherings there in an attempt to curb the outbreak.

Law enforcement authorities dished out over $150,000 in penalties over the weekend in the coronavirus hot-spots — and will continue to enforce the restrictions this week, de Blasio said.

When asked about why large gatherings in the virus hot-spots were being treated differently than the summer’s anti-racism demonstrations, the mayor only said that “It’s a different situation.”

He later added: “Any large gatherings create a problem.”

“We can not let this resurgence grow into a second wave in New York City,” de Blasio said.

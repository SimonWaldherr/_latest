Five men accused in a shocking plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are to appear in federal court Tuesday for a hearing on whether they should be detained before trial.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Berens will oversee the bail and detention proceeding in Grand Rapids for Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, all of whom are Michigan residents. A sixth man, Barry Croft, is being held in Delaware.

The FBI made arrests last week after using confidential sources, undercover agents and clandestine recordings to foil the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Some of the suspects had conducted coordinated surveillance of the Democratic governor’s vacation home in northern Michigan in August and September, according to a criminal complaint.

The men wanted to retaliate against Whitmer because of her “uncontrolled power” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities said. They said four of the men had planned to meet last week to pay for explosives and exchange tactical gear.

Whitmer, who was a potential running mate for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and is nearly halfway through a four-year term, has been widely praised for her response to the coronavirus outbreak but also sharply criticized by Republican lawmakers and people in conservative areas of the state. The Capitol has been the site of many rallies, including ones with gun-toting protesters calling for her ouster.

Whitmer imposed major restrictions on personal movement and the economy to curb transmission of the coronavirus. Many of those limits have been lifted since spring.

Fox, who was described as one of the ringleaders of the kidnap plan, was living in the basement of a vacuum cleaner shop in Grand Rapids. The owner said Fox was opposed to wearing masks during the pandemic and kept firearms and ammunition at the store.

The defendants face up to life in prison if convicted.

Seven others linked to a paramilitary group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged in state court for allegedly seeking to storm the Michigan Capitol and providing material support for terrorist acts by seeking a “civil war.”

The investigation is ongoing.

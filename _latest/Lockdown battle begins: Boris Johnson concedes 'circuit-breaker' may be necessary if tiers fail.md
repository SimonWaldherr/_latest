However, he came under attack from all sides on Tuesday night. Making the case for the economy, 42 Tory MPs rebelled over the 10pm curfew rule, saying it was needlessly putting pubs out of business.

Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, said existing restrictions had triggered record redundancies and could condemn swathes of workers to long-term unemployment.

On the opposite side of the debate, scientists said Mr Johnson would risk 107,000 additional deaths if he did not impose a circuit break. Sir Keir demanded a two to three-week lockdown.

On Tuesday, 143 coronavirus-related deaths were recorded, the highest figure for four months. Health officials described it as "hugely concerning".

Mr Johnson was dealt another blow when the chairman of the UK vaccine task force said a coronavirus vaccine was only likely to be 50 per cent effective, in line with flu deterrents.

Earlier, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, had said the concept of herd immunity from the virus was "emphatically false" as there could be no mass immunity "even if everyone caught it".

Sir Keir's intervention was seen as an indication that he believed the Prime Minister would ultimately be left with no choice but to impose a "circuit-breaker" and wanted to make it appear that he was following Labour's lead.

He spoke moments before Mr Johnson faced his own MPs in a meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, and tried to divide the Tories by saying the Prime Minister could count on Labour votes for such a plan, implying that he may need to if his own party members rebelled against it.

Mr Johnson told the committee the Labour leader was "careering all over the place like a broken shopping trolley" because he was calling for a national lockdown while some of his own front benchers were opposing local restrictions in their areas.

Labour abstained on Tuesday when Parliament voted to approve the three-tier system announced by the Prime Minister on Monday.

It took me about three years to work out how to use Instagram. I spent another two agonising whether I wanted to. I’m guessing a lot of us feel the same.

In the beginning, it seemed obvious it would be another mindless tool for vacuous yoof. As it celebrates its 10th anniversary, Instagram can count a billion regular users, 45 per cent of whom are over 35. That’s an age spectrum many corporations would kill for. Even if you don’t ’gram yourself, there’s a high probability you’re influenced by someone who does.

Insta has made stars of narcissists, exhibitionists and those blessed with mystifyingly elusive talents. But once you get over yourself and realise that many of us are confounding composites of good and bad traits (which is why your brilliant and intelligent friend manages to post such cringingly clunky, self-promoting stories on their Instagram), you realise that like every Libran (ahem), in the end, Instagram is remarkably balanced. I don’t want to belittle the FOMO and body dysmorphia that can be triggered by too much exposure to pictures of (often airbrushed) perfect physical specimens. But the flip side is that Instagram has enabled people previously patronised or excluded by fashion to have a stake.

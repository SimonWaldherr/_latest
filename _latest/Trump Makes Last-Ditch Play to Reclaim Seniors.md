President Donald Trump pleaded with senior citizens Friday to stick with him, promising free vaccines and therapeutics to help them fight the coronavirus and painting an apocalyptic picture of a Biden administration that would strip them of Medicare and Social Security benefits in a last-ditch pitch to reclaim an important voting bloc that's increasingly supporting his challenger.

"I will protect you, I will defend you, I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and conviction that I have," the president said Friday afternoon in Fort Myers. "You devoted your life to this country and I am devoting my life to you."

The pledge comes as polls show Trump shedding support at an alarming rate from seniors – a demographic he handily won in 2016 by 7 points.

The most recent national polls, including one from CNN/SSRS and another from The Wall Street Journal/NBC News, found the former vice president with more than a 20-point lead over Trump among voters 65 and older.

"I'm moving heaven and earth to safeguard our seniors from the China virus to deliver life-saving therapies in record time and to distribute a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year," Trump said. "We're really doing it even sooner than that."

The president said his administration is on track to deliver at least 100 million doses of vaccine this year and recently inked a deal with CVS and Walgreens to supply it directly to nursing homes at no cost.

"No cost," he said. "Once you have that vaccine – these are very effective – once you have that vaccine, you can open those doors and say, 'Here I am.'"

Trump's remarks come the same week as Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson paused their separate large-scale COVID-19 vaccine trials over safety concerns, making the timeline for completion uncertain.

The pitch to senior citizens also comes as the president has appeared open to considering the idea of "herd immunity" to combat the virus, a concept public health experts blast as "dangerous," including the federal government's top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, who called the idea "ridiculous."

Herd immunity involves allowing the natural spread of the virus through the population until enough people are infected and immune that it drives infection rates down. Public health experts consider it especially dangerous for vulnerable populations, like senior citizens.

The 54 million senior citizens in the U.S. are especially important for Trump in swing states like Florida that political strategists say he must win in order to secure reelection. The latest polling in Florida, where seniors account for about 30% of registered voters, shows Biden leading.

Biden's rise in support among seniors tracks with his campaign spending targeting them. Since the end of July, his campaign spent roughly $45 million targeting seniors on broadcast and cable, according to TV ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics, far outspending the Trump campaign.

During the speech Friday, the president painted a grim picture of a Biden administration that would strip seniors of Medicare and Social Security benefits in favor of programs like free college.

"The plan by Washington Democrats to give amnesty and free health care to illegal border-crossers will obliterate Medicare, bankrupt you Social Security, robbing you of the benefits you paid for your entire life," he said. "When you say free health care, free education, this and that, we're going to have millions of people pouring into this country."

"As long as I'm president, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare or your Social Security," he said.

Trump also played up the prospect of sending as many as 39 million Medicare recipients $200 prescription drug cards – a pitch he initially made last month to slow the bleed of seniors away from his campaign. But the plan's prospects are uncertain in no small part due to the $7.8 billion price tag, which would come from Medicare's Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund.

Biden was also in Florida this week talking to senior citizens, trying to expand the narrow lead he currently enjoys there in the polls.

"The only senior that Donald Trump cares about – the only senior – is senior Donald Trump," he said in a speech at a community center in Broward County.

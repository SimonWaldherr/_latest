description: > 
  An early forecast for Election Day shows mostly benign weather for the big day.Does the weather on Election Day really matter?Some studies suggest that 'bad weather' on Election Day benefits Republicans because it dissuades new or less intense voters, though other studies are less conclusive."However, because of COVID-19 fears at the polls on Election Day and the resulting surge in early or absentee voting, the weather on Election Day itself could be less important this year than it has been in past presidential elections.USA TODAY will provide more detailed national weather forecasts as we approach Election Day.

description: > 
  “I think it’s really unfortunate and really disappointing that they did that,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, said on Tapper’s “The Lead.” “It’s so clear that I’m not a political person, and I have never either directly or indirectly endorsed a political candidate.And to take a completely out-of-context statement and put it into what is obviously a political campaign ad I thought was very disappointing.”

A Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be only 50 per cent effective, the chairman of the UK Vaccine Taskforce has said.

Kate Bingham said any vaccine capable of immunising against the virus would probably be as effective as the flu vaccine.

“The vaccines we have for flu are about 50 per cent effective,” she said.

“We shouldn’t assume it’s going to be better than a flu vaccine, because that’s an equivalent – it’s a mutating … respiratory virus that gets in through the nose and eyes and respiratory tract.”

Meanwhile the head of the Oxford University coronavirus vaccine team said face masks and social distancing may be needed until July, even if the global trial proved successful.

“Even if we had enough vaccine for everyone, it’s unlikely that … the physical distancing rules can be just dropped,” Prof Andrew Pollard told the Daily Mail.

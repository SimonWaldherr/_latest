<div><p>Around half of savers hold their cash with the same bank as their current account and miss out on rates that are nearly 100 times better.</p>
<p>High-street banks have been <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/will-coronavirus-affect-pension-savings-investments-guide-do/">slashing interest rates </a>since the Bank of England cuts its base rate from 0.75pc to 0.1pc. However, lesser known banks have actually&#160;started paying out more to savers.</p>
<p>But there has been no&#160;mass exodus away from the major lenders.&#160; Some 45pc of people still hold their Isa cash with the same bank as their current account,&#160;research from stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown showed.&#160;Yet this loyalty does not pay off.</p>
<p>NatWest&#8217;s easy-access account, for example, pays just 0.01pc. However, the best instant-access deal is from Coventry Building Society and pays 0.96pc. This means a saver with &#163;20,000 would earn just &#163;2 from NatWest but Coventry would return &#163;192.</p>
<p>Barclays also pays just 0.01pc, although this is rising to 0.02pc in November. TSB&#8217;s easy-access option pays just 0.02pc as well, meaning that a saver with &#163;20,000 would earn just &#163;4 interest over a year.</p>

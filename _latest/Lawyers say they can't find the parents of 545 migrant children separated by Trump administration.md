  Lawyers say they can't find the parents of 545 migrant children separated by Trump administration 
description: > 
  WASHINGTON — Lawyers appointed by a federal judge to identify migrant families who were separated by the Trump administration say they have yet to track down the parents of 545 children, and that approximately two-thirds of those parents were deported to Central America without their children, according to a filing from the ACLU on Tuesday.The Trump administration instituted a "zero tolerance" policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern U.S. border.The ACLU and other pro-bono law firms were tasked with finding the members of families separated during that pilot program.The group Justice in Motion is physically searching for the separated parents in Mexico and Central America.“While we have already located many deported parents, there are hundreds more who we are still trying to reach,” said the group in a statement.

"There is so much more work to be done to find these families."</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">"People ask when we will find all of these families and, sadly, I can&#8217;t give an answer. I just don&#8217;t know. But we will not stop looking until we have found every one of the families, no matter how long it takes. The tragic reality is that hundreds of parents were deported to Central America without their children, who remain here with foster families or distant relatives.&#8221;</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">The ACLU and other organizations that are part of a court-appointed "steering committee" learned that more than 1,000 families were separated in 2017 based on data provided by the Department of Homeland Security. Of those, it has been able to contact the parents of more than 550 children and believes about 25 of them may have a chance of being able to come back to the U.S. for reunification.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">Gelernt said some of the families contacted have elected to keep their children in the U.S. with a family member or sponsor "due to fear of what will happen to their child if they return" to their home countries.</p><p></p><p class="endmarkEnabled">The group Justice in Motion is physically searching for the separated parents in Mexico and Central America. &#8220;While we have already located many deported parents, there are hundreds more who we are still trying to reach,&#8221; said the group in a statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s an arduous and time-consuming process on a good day. During the pandemic, our team of human rights defenders is taking special measures to protect their own security and safety, as well as that of the parents and their communities.&#8221;</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">A separate court order directed that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/watchdog-confirms-botched-family-reunifications-kept-migrant-children-waiting-vans-n1238902" target="_blank">reunite families</a> separated under zero tolerance in 2018.</p><p class="endmarkEnabled">DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div>

While Riverdale fans wait for another season of the deliciously dark teen drama, characters from the South Side are all set to feature in a comic book. Riverdale's South Side Serpents are getting a new Archie Comics one-shot.

In an update comes from Archie Comics' panel at New York Comic-Con, Archie Comics will soon publish a one-shot that arrives on January 27, 2021. Titled 'Riverdale Presents: South Side Serpents #1', the comic scripted by David Barnett and illustrated by Richard Ortiz will feature our favourite Serpents Jughead, Toni Topaz and F.P. Jones alongside other members of the gang including Fangs and Sweet Pea. The cover for the one-shot is already out and it's all kinds of perfect:

The cover has F.P., Toni and Jughead rocking their signature jackets with the 'Now Leaving Riverdale' sign in the backdrop. It also teases the plot of Jughead stepping "into the role of the leader to guide the Serpents on a perilous journey". The story is a part of the Riverdale TV-verse and exists alongside the CW show. As per Decider's report, it will follow F.P. Jones (Skeet Ulrich) recruiting Serpents Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse), Toni Topaz (Vanessa Morgan), Fangs Fogarty (Drew Ray Tanner) and Sweet Pea (Jordan Connor) for a mission to retain the gang's former glory.

Fans of the angsty take on Archie Comics characters will know that Riverdale has inspired comics that tie-in to the show's universe. The last time we saw Toni in an Archie Comics feature, it was in a comic book-run chronicling Cheryl Blossom and Toni Topaz's road trip (the one they took right before the Season 3 premiere). The comics series takes on familiar characters and gives them connected arcs we don't see on the series.

Riverdale Season 5 is currently in production with new episodes expected to drop in 2021.

<div><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are inching closer to a deal on a coronavirus stimulus bill and will resume negotiations on Wednesday, though the window to secure an agreement before the election increasingly narrows.</p><p>Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke for 45 minutes on Tuesday afternoon to continue hammering out the differences &#8211; both in price tag and legislative language &#8211; on additional coronavirus aid and scheduled another talk for Wednesday afternoon. The California Democrat's office said the two have asked committee heads "to resolve differences about funding levels and language."</p><p id="ac-lre-player"></p><p>Prior to their conversation, Pelosi appeared to walk back a self-imposed deadline of trying to reach a deal by Tuesday, instead characterizing the timeline during a Bloomberg TV interview as the day "we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step." She said that a bill would need to be written by the end of the week in order for it to pass Congress before the Nov. 3 election.</p><p>"Their conversation provided more clarity and common ground as they move closer to an agreement," Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill tweeted. "Today's deadline enabled the Speaker and Secretary to see that decisions could be reached and language could be exchanged, demonstrating that both sides are serious about finding a compromise."</p><p class="Box-w0dun1-0 SlideshowEmbed__HeadingBox-fkpjfn-1 htMIQB"><h3 size="3" class="Heading__HeadingStyled-sc-1w5xk2o-0-h3 eSzSqG Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-1 jFucEe">Photos: Daily Life, Disrupted</h3></p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/a0eb38c/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F29%2Fad%2F7c51afd846059305620685f70460%2Fcoronavirus-03.JPG" alt="TOPSHOT - A passenger in an outfit (R) poses for a picture as a security guard wearing a facemask as a preventive measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus stands nearby on a last century-style boat, featuring a theatrical drama set between the 1920s and 1930s in Wuhan, in Chinas central Hubei province on September 27, 2020.

When asked if they could reach an agreement by the end of the week, Pelosi said, "I hope so. That's the plan," according to Capitol Hill pool reports. </p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>Pelosi told Bloomberg TV earlier on Tuesday that the biggest differences remain over Democrats' priority for state and local aid and the GOP push for liability protections for businesses, hospitals and universities. In recent days, the White House has upped its offer to nearly $1.9 trillion, moving closer to Democrats' $2.2 trillion proposal.</p><p>White House chief of staff Mark Meadows offered a similar assessment of where the two sides stand but told CNBC on Tuesday evening that there was "still a ways to go." He said that President Donald Trump remains "bullish" on trying to strike a deal and indicated that if the price tag is the only remaining sticking point, that "we perhaps increase the amount of money" for the small business loan program or up the amount of the stimulus checks.</p><p>"The conversations today were productive enough to continue to have discussions tomorrow," Meadows said.</p><p id="ad" class="ad lazy "></p><p>Senate Republicans, however, remain the largest hurdle in coronavirus aid efforts. It's uncertain that another multitrillion-dollar bill could pass the Senate, especially in the two weeks before the election.</p><p>Republicans, instead, are currently focusing on passing more targeted coronavirus relief bills in lieu of another massive package. The Senate will vote Tuesday on a bill that will provide a $260 billion infusion to the Paycheck Protection Program. Then on Wednesday, senators will vote on a $500 billion bill that will likely be rejected by most Democrats.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday that the Senate would "consider" a deal struck between the White House and Democrats but didn't specify when he'd do so and if that'd be before the election.</p><p id="ad" class="ad"></p><p>But McConnell told Republicans at a private lunch on Tuesday that he urged the White House not to reach a stimulus deal prior to the election, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/20/trump-economic-stimulus-pelosi/">according to The Washington Post</a>. Any deal would need 60 votes, meaning 13 Republicans would need to support it if all 47 Democrats are on board. Republicans have cast doubt on the prospects of more than a dozen GOP senators backing another big stimulus package.<br></p></div>

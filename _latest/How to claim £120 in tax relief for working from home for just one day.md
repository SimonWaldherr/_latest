<div><p>Millions are missing out on new tax breaks introduced in April for those working from home &#8211; and you can even claim if you have spent just one day this year in a home office.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/news/workers-handed-new-tax-breaks-buy-home-office-equipment/">Since 6 April 2020</a>, temporary tax breaks have allowed employers to pay workers up to &#163;6 a week tax-free to cover additional costs if they have had to work from home because of coronavirus. If workers do not get the &#163;6 allowance, they can still claim the tax relief.</p>
<p>Workers who pay basic rate of income tax can claim &#163;1.20 a week in tax relief&#160;&#8211; 20pc of &#163;6 &#8211; towards the cost of their household bills. Higher-rate 40pc taxpayers can claim &#163;2.40 a week. Over the year this adds up to &#163;62.40 for basic-rate payers and &#163;124.80 for higher earners.&#160;</p>
<p>The flat-rate relief covers the entire tax year, so you will be paid the same amount regardless of how many days you have worked at home or in the office. The relief will also apply to previous weeks you worked from home due to Covid-19 in the prior tax year before April, such as in March when lockdown began.</p>
<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs said it estimated five million people would be eligible to apply. It launched an online applications portal at the start of October, but only 54,800 people have submitted claims&#160;so far, according to the latest figures.&#160;</p>
<p>Data from the Office for National Statistics suggested an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/return/rishi-sunak-urged-introduce-tax-breaks-people-working-home/">even higher number</a> could be missing out.</p>
<p>ONS survey numbers taken from the first week of October showed 22pc of people are now working exclusively from home. Its latest labour market estimates taken in June and&#160;August&#160;showed close to 33 million people aged 16 years and over were employed.&#160;</p>
<p>This means more than seven million people who potentially could be eligible to claim&#160;have yet to do so. More people are likely to become eligible for the relief if they return to home working&#160;over winter, as coronavirus cases rise and tougher restrictions are introduced.&#160;</p>
<p>Applicants can backdate their claims to April, when the new rules were announced, but the reliefs are only temporary and are due to come to and end in March.</p>
<p>Once workers have submitted a claim and the online application has been approved, HMRC will adjust their tax codes for the 2020-2021 tax year. The employee will receive the tax relief directly through their salary until March 2021.</p>
<p>Employees do not need to prove their bills have increased unless they are applying for tax relief on costs above the &#163;6 per week. In this case, HMRC will need to see evidence of the increased costs, such as a copy of a bill.</p>
<p>Employees can receive the tax relief as a lump sum payment if they wait and apply once the 2020-21 tax year has ended.</p>
<p>The tax authority said it wanted all workers &#8220;to get the money they are entitled to&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8220;We recognise that the working from home situation is very fluid this year, so we&#8217;re accepting claims for the full year&#8217;s expenses. That includes even if people have only worked from home for some of the year, to avoid needing to contact us if you have to work from home again.&#8221;</p>

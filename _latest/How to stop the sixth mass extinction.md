  How to stop the sixth mass extinction

  To understand how big of a deal that is you don't have to look much further than the definition of "mass extinction."The sixth extinction would be the first caused by humans.And I can tell you that while this topic is enormously depressing, there is some good news: We know how to slow or hopefully stop the sixth extinction.Ehrlich, from Stanford, said population growth is one of the main drivers of the Earth's extinction crisis.We must find a way to reconnect with nature and to see this wave of extinction for the crisis that it is.

To do that, the world needs to be off fossil fuels this century -- hopefully closer to 2030 than 2100. That's a tall order, but Stanford University <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf" target="_blank">researchers have shown we can do it with existing technology</a> like wind, solar and nuclear.</p><a></a><p>Policies that promote cleaner energy include carbon taxes, cap-and-trade pollution pricing systems and renewable energy tax credits.

The Trump administration in the United States, however, threatens to move the world's second-biggest climate polluter away from that agreement and back towards dirty, climate-warming fuels.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>2.

Elephant ivory is carved into trinkets. And rhino horn is mistakenly sold as an aphrodisiac. </p><a></a><p>And there are other less-known markets, too, including those for pangolin meat (a delicacy), giraffe tails (bracelets) and tiger bone (medicine). Efforts to shut down these markets have been grossly inadequate, as the black market in environmental products is estimated to be worth <a href="http://unep.org/documents/itw/environmental_crimes.pdf" target="_blank">$91 billion to $258 billion per year</a> . Compare that to drug trafficking, the most lucrative black market, which is worth $344 billion per year, according to a United Nations and Interpol estimate.</p><a></a><a></a><p>Experts say better law enforcement is needed to stop poaching. And consumers -- especially those in Asia, where wildlife products tend to be popular -- need to stop buying these illegal and harmful goods.

Ehrlich, from Stanford, said population growth is one of the main drivers of the Earth's extinction crisis. The population was about 4 billion in 1980. It's now 7.4 billion and is rapidly heading for <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/2015-report.html" target="_blank">9.7 billion by 2050</a> , according to the United Nations.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>5.

We don't understand it and therefore, naively, dangerously, we figure it's doing just fine or will rebound. Barnosky, the extinction expert from Stanford, said we think of the natural world like a bottomless checking account when we need to see it as a savings account. </p><p></p><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-40 cn-zoneAdContainer"></ul><p class="zn-body__paragraph">We humans also have ridiculously short attention spans. Issues like extinction and climate change play out over decades, centuries and millennia. Our actions now -- or inaction -- will matter for thousands of years. "You can have catastrophic events that are seen in slow motion, basically, and not register on people very well," said Ehrlich. We must find a way to reconnect with nature and to see this wave of extinction for the crisis that it is. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Have other ideas or questions?

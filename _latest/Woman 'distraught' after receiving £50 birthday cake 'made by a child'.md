<p>     </p> <p>Mrs Faulkner told BerkshireLive: "My daughter was distraught at when she opened the box. It was nothing like the picture.</p> <p>"She'd paid half the money for the cake to this woman and what came back looked like it was made by a child. Honestly, it was laughably bad.</p> <p>"The name Graham didn't even have a capital letter, it was that bad.</p> <p> "I was very cross, so I said 'I'm putting it on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> '. Once I did that, it became clear there were other people who had encountered her as well. </p>

 <p>"I tried to contact her and she blocked me straight away and deleted the page."</p> <p>BerkshireLive also tried to contact "Emma Beth Mh" through Facebook, and the page was immediately taken down.</p> <p>Mrs Faulkner said: "I'm going to Trading Standards as she's clearly not a proper cake maker. We're now able to see the funny side of it afterwards, but at the time we were very upset.</p> <p class="loading-circle primary-theme-spinner"></p>

<p>"Even though we had a laugh about it, I still want to warn people this fake cake maker is out there producing these monstrosities and charging people for these terrible attempts at cakes."</p> <p>Sue said the woman was initially reluctant to give her daughter her money back, but &#163;15 has now been returned which is "about as good as we'll get".</p> <p> It is thought the cake maker lives in <a href="https://www.getreading.co.uk/all-about/reading">Reading</a> and a spokesperson for <a href="https://www.getreading.co.uk/all-about/reading-borough-council">Reading Borough Council</a> said the authority has received complaints and was carrying out an investigation. </p> <p>The council added its Environmental Health team was also involved.</p> <p> <strong>Do you have a story to share?

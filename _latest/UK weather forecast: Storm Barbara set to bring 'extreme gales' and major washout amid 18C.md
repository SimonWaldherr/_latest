 <p>     </p> <p>Barbara's impact will be mostly felt with rain in the southeast and possibly central England on Wednesday - though forecasters warn the storm's system is still uncertain.</p> <p>Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Frank Saunders, said Tuesday sees a low-pressure system separate from the named storm crossing Ireland and "bringing gale or even severe gale force winds" to parts of western UK.</p> <p>"As we look ahead to the rest of the week, we are expecting rain or showers for many areas on Wednesday, possibly heavy and blustery in the southeast," he continued.</p>

 <p>"It will be quieter on Thursday but more unsettled from Friday, with spells of wet and windy weather moving in from the west."</p> <p>The Met Office has, however, moved to deny any possibility of widespread snow for the rest of October.</p> <p>If any snow is seen at all before the end of the month it will be confined to the Scottish hills, it added.</p> <p>While temperatures are expected to remain average or a little below towards the north west and slightly above in the southeast for the time of year.</p>
